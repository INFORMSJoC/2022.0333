Very Disappointed!,"I sent this phone back and received a refund as Pure Talk or Straight Talk wouldn't work with this phone. I was very disappointed to spend so much time on trying to find a network that would work. Then upon returning the phone they kept about $60.00 from the original amount I paid, so I didn't get a full refund. I gave my reason that their website information on Amazon is wrong because this phone, even though it is a new phone, doesn't work with ALL CARRIERS! When 3G was shut down a few months ago, this particular phone doesn't work now. I found that out the hard way and verified this with the AT&amp;T site that shows what phones are still compatible after the shutdown. So disappointed!",2022年5月29日 在美国审核

Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8.",2022年2月26日 在印度审核

Best budget phone at this price!!!!,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.",2022年3月14日 在印度审核

I don't see anything wrong with it. It's just a good phone. Delivery was shite though!,"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars.

****VERY DISPOINTED BY 1PLUS****. Sound and back camera poor quality.,"****Don't buy any phones from Amazon*** i really had a bad exp. DISLIKE:For 25k poor build quality. Same configuration in real me etc are coming less than 18k only. Just for 1+ brand don't buy for 25k.---&gt; Audio is worst, single speaker but volume too low in calls for other end. I think phone mic issues.----&gt; Back camera not good---&gt; phone touch also I felt bit lack.Like:--------+Fast charging, within 30min 100% charge .Front cam bit okay.Battery backup is good.8 5g bands. Support, dual 4g standby.**** If OnePlus can promise if they can do something on back camera quality and Audio improvements with updates buy it with any offers. Otherwise go for real me gt master or 9pro or 9pro plus.And moto mobiles also good. I was using moto for 6years for only good camera and sound i took this but those two only drawback for this phone rest all okay manageble. And no return policy only replacement.",2022年2月28日 在印度审核
Average phone,"I didn't upload pics cause I forgot to take them. I am a one plus user since 2016. I bought one plus 3T when it was launched. That phone is still with me working fine. I am a true one plus fan. So my review on this phone is that it very basic.To be honest I am disappointed with the phone. I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is Cons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay. But this is no where near to high gaming or photo fan phone",2022年3月6日 在印度审核
"Not worthable, so many Back drops, i am totally disappointed ","Over heating while charging &amp; too much heating when browsing through mobile network, even while using camera for capturing pics also phone getting too much heat, fast battery drain, face unlock not working properly, even sometimes phe getting hang while touching icons, phe heating in 1hr usage, while using Bluetooth headphones for calling the voice will be very low. So many Back drops are there. Not worthable. Its not up to the mark of one plus company. I am totally disappointed ",2022年3月1日 在印度审核

"It's a decent phone in its class , more likely a non OnePlus in OnePlus shell","It's a decent phone in its class but you get better options in same price in the market . The wide angel camera is not that good. No zoom option in 64 mp camera mode. Didn't like the slow-motion video . Macro shot is not great to work with . Battery drains quite quickly in normal usage in a day. Speaker sound is not that good. Display lacks vivid colours as the Samsung display is way better in 15k budget phones if you ask me .Pros.1: 3.5mm jack port that was missing previously2: currently the cheapest OnePlus. so , it's affordable.3: decent camera in the class but not the best.",2022年3月8日 在印度审核
Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",2022年2月28日 在印度审核
Good but not up to the mark,"Good phone. But camera is average like 16000/- phone. Thay given mono speaker, in this price range we can get Dolby on other phone. Any way performance is good. Very fast like blink of your eyes. But much over priced. It should come in 22k to 23k range.",2022年3月4日 在印度审核

One Plus is Brand,I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Batterystays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camerais not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,2022年3月28日 在印度审核

Affordable good quality.,"A big fan of 1+ phones n this is my fourth 1+ during last 6-7 years. Reason : Price competitive for the same specs of other Chinese competition makes. That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.<br>Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone. Better remove phone cover while playing games.</br>",2022年4月3日 在印度审核

The looks are awesome but the plastic back panel disappointing it could be glass. The good thing is you get one plus stickers and a plastic back cover with damage protection (the design of the back cover in a way that it protects your mobile glass from the damage the corners are edgy) so you don't need to buy it with extra cost.

While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,I expected better.

Bad product. Has heating issues,"I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.<br><br>But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .<br>As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.</br></br></br>",2022年5月28日 在印度审核

Excellent phone for the price!,"Why pay $700+ for a smartphone when you can get this one with the same functionality at less than a tenth of the price?I've had this phone for a few months now and it's worked great after I got some initial kinks worked out.Some things to keep in mind:-I'd recommend doing a factory reset as soon as you get the phone.Not sure why but mine refused to use my network's data and no one could figure it out but once I did a factory reset and tried it again it worked like a charm.I've heard other issues with this phone that a reset has fixed too so wouldn't hurt to do one before you put much on it.-This has very little usable memory (about 2GB) so that means you will be limited in what you can put on this phone.If you love having tons of games then you may want to look for something else.If you only use a few apps like me then you should be fine.Especially if you have an extra SD card you can use to bump up the storage space.Overall it's not a perfect phone but for the price I personally think it's well worth it to go with something like this over a much more expensive phone.In fact, the call quality and reception are actually better than my old Samsung Galaxy S5!Very good deal for the price.",2016年7月13日 在美国审核
Great For My Teens,"So far so good!I bought one for my son and then turned about and bought one for my daughter!Though they are low on space, they definitely serve their purpose, a way for them to communicate, have a couple social apps on it, my tracking and monitoring apps and a decent camera.They mostly use it to text, listen to Spotify, go on Facebook and Youtube.Battery life seems to last them all day and when school was in...they definitely got a full days use out if them!",2016年7月16日 在美国审核
Failed after one year,"I hardly used this cell phone.I had this cell using a pay as you go SIM through T-Mobile so my spouse could coordinate airport pickups while I was in the short term wait lot.It was used very little but just after the one year warranty expired, some of the touch screen icons became unresponsive over about most of the surface area.I tried rebooting several times without success before I gave up and tried a hard reset which accomplished nothing as the on-screen keyboard still did not work so that I could even enter in a wifi password to set the phone up.I thought a low cost phone was what I needed for my limited needs, but did not consider that such a poor quality product can barely last more than a year under extremely light, careful use.I won't buy a Blu to replace it and will stick with slightly more expensive, but much better known brands such as the Samsung Galaxy Prime which I just ordered for just a little bit more money at $80.I really recommend to others that they don't cheap out like I did.As a result of this I recently talked with cell phone sales reps at Best Buy and Sams Club about Blu phones they told me they have a terrible reputation for quality.and a very high failure rate in comparison with the top brands.",2016年8月5日 在美国审核
Good,"I've had it for about 4 years, about to change phones but man it's really strong. It's fallen from 3 storeys high and the screen didn't shatter, not even a scratch, I have it in a case and I use a screen protector. Camera quality is like 6/10 but hey it's a $50 phone. Recently it's not holding charge so well, when fully charged I'll get like 4hrs heavy use (social media, YouTube videos, calls etc) not the best but definitely not the worse either.

I decided against going with another on-contract phone and scoured Amazon for a good off-contract option,"Blu Advance 5.0 HD reviewSept. 19, 2016On Sept. 4, my Samsung Galaxy S6 was washed, which forced me to look into a replacement phone. I decided against going with another on-contract phone and scoured Amazon for a good off-contract option. I initially looked at Motorola phones, such as the Moto G and X, but decided that was more than I wanted to spend at the time. I then came across the Blu series of phones.I was apprehensive about buying a $60 phone from a maker I was unfamiliar with, but upon seeing the positive reviews I went ahead and bought the phone. Since it arrived I’ve been nothing but impressed with what it can do for less than $100 after using it for almost two weeks.The phone runs a very close to stock version of Android 6.0, which is great to see. The only bloatware I noticed was the Amazon Shopping app. I even had to hunt down the standard YouTube app from the Play store when I was setting the phone up. All that is good when you consider the phone only has 8GB of internal storage, though I did add a 32GB memory card.Battery life is outstanding for me. I take it off the charger every morning around 6:45 and when I get home around 6:30 it usually has around 30 percent battery life left. The phone’s battery is not that big in terms of milliamps, but I think the efficiency of Android 6.0 is what makes the difference.With this being said, I don’t use my phone for work during the week except for when I’m on my lunch break. The phone does take awhile to charge, as it lacks any form of quick charging. I find it takes just over two hours to charge from dead to 100 percent.The camera is satisfactory to me. I’m not attaching pictures, but many other people have. Specs wise it’s a little behind a flagship phone from Samsung or Apple, but the pictures I’ve taken have looked fine to me.The screen is 720p, with a pixels per inch of just under 300, which is behind other flagship phones, but still a usable display. It gets fairly bright and can even be seen outside. I have no issues with the screen considering the price of the phone.Call quality seems the same as on my Galaxy, but I do notice the phone sometimes does not work with my 2013 Ford Escape’s Bluetooth. Sometimes when I press the button to say the voice command to make a call the phone pauses but does not actually make the call. It’s a minor inconvenience and I’m not sure who’s fault it is: the maker of the car’s Bluetooth (Microsoft) or the phone’s. The phone shows I’m connected to AT&amp;T’s 4G network most of the time. I’ve seen some people say the phone lacks 4G connectivity, but from what I’m seeing that is not true.I thought the 1GB of RAM might be limiting with this phone, but so far it has not been. The phone shows I’m using an average of about 78 percent of the RAM. To compare, an iPhone 6S has 2GB of RAM while a Galaxy S6 has 3 or 4GB of RAM, depending on the model. The 1GB of RAM does not make the phone feel sluggish as the menus still come up quickly and apps launch in a satisfactory timeframe.Another note is I find the keyboard difficult to type on. I’m not someone who texts that much, but when I do I’m constantly hitting the wrong keys. I’ve even installed other keyboards, but find the results the same. The touch sensor does seem to be fairly low in its sensitivity level when scrolling through apps or web pages, but I’m not sure if that affects texting. Your mileage may vary.To give some perspective, I’m a 26-year old who works at a university in the financial aid office. I do not use my phone for work at all and uses it mostly to read Reddit posts, watch YouTube, follow Twitter links to news stories and manage fantasy football teams. I don’t play games on my phone at all really. I consider myself to be a power user, but not in the same way as someone who plays games on their phone for hours per day. I use mine mostly for media consumption.Overall I’m very impressed with what this phone does for $60. If you’re someone looking for a new phone on a budget, perhaps for a grandparent, child or as a replacement to a lost or broken phone, the Advance 5.0 HD will do the job. In fact the first time I showed it to my fairly tech-savvy friend, he initially thought it was an iphone.",2016年9月19日 在美国审核

Loses service with full bars,I just got this blu advance 5.0 and I love the phone its fast and the screen is a good size for the price and its very clear and vibrant in the colors.

Great phone with no storage,I got this phone cuz mine broke and I needed one quick and cheap. For the money this phone is AWESOME! my only complaint is the storage capacity. 4GB total but after the operating system you're left with less then half a gig!

BLU is the best value smart phone company in the world.,"Probably the best value I have ever gotten from a smart phone purchase. I love this little work horse. Get a 64 GB micro SD card and this phone will service all your basic needs and then some. I have convinced 6 people to buy BLU phones since I got mine and they are all thanking me. This is truly a great company and we should all pay attention to their entire line. My next phone is going to be one of the $200 phones. I can't go on enough about the value of this phone. Just get one for a laugh like I did, thinking I'd have it a month or two till the next line of Samsung comes out...and I just decided to ride it out cause I really don't need the Galaxy for anything besides the camera.The camera on this phone isn't crap but it sure ain't like the $600 phones. It's 5 megapixels, not bad, like the cams that were in the best phones 4-5 years ago. i never expected anymore for the price and this phone always surprises with what it offers...for $60!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mom's new phone,"LOVE this phone. I had a Samsung Galaxy that was a couple years old and didn't want to spend a fortune on a new phone. I had bought my daughter a Blu phone last year and decided to try one for my self. At this price point it is an excellent phone. It does everything I need and I am very happy with it. I also bought a 16gb card for media and app storage, knowing that internal storage was limited.*** EDIT, When I went to transfer media to my phone from my computer I ran into an issue. I had to go to Microsoft and download an MTP update to use the usb connection properly. This was because windows 10 is still a little glitch-y and nothing to do with the phone, which worked fine with my daughters computer that was running windows 8.1.****Edit, The SD card slot stopped working. Couldn't store pics, apps, or access the sd card. I had to return/exchange the phone. The process of exchange was actually easy. I downloaded the return labels. They sent a new phone, and once I received it, I put the old phone in the box, taped on the return labels and took it to a UPS store. The replacement works fine, and I still really like this phone.**Edit. Replacement phone has SD card reading problems as well. I have to reboot daily. Or more often to a access anything stored on SD card, pics, music, apps, etc. Phone storage is very limited so having a working sd card is important.It is very inconvenient when you go to take a picture then realize you have to reboot or the picture won't save.I also have trouble with the low screen bug. If you turn brightness down too far, the screen goes black and won't light up. You have to turn off/on and keep phone 'awake' until you can adjust brightness back up.",2016年2月17日 在美国审核

Adequate for my needs.,"I don't use a corporate carrier for my mobile phones. I dumped Verizon 2 years ago and use alternative means for talking and texting. TextNow for $13.99 a month instead of $100 a month. I had Skype mobile on my last phone and used Free TextNow app for texting, on a Windows phone 8.1...which I loved, but it died. I needed an inexpensive phone to replace the $800 Verizon Windows phone, enter the Blue Advance 5.0 HD.This is the first Android I've ever used and know nothing about the system. The ""Blu help"" app on this phone is pretty useless, so off to YouTube to get help! First thing you have to do is uninstall any app you will never use and are allowed to uninstall. Then disable any app you won't use, but aren't allowed to delete. That frees up a little space so you can install the apps you actually want and need. A YouTube tip: uninstall the Opera browser after you download the Mini Opera browser in the Google store. That frees up even more space and the Mini Opera works fine.There's still not enough space for EVERYTHING you want, but you can get necessities. For me, necessities are TextNow, Old Phone ringtones, WeatherBug and Xodo Docs PDF reader (niiiice PDF reader and better than Adobe!). That left me with only 2.18 GB of storage space and that's with an added 64 GB micro SD card of which only 415 MB is stored. The phone software decides what's stored on the SD card, not you, so really, it's pretty useless too. I knew this phone was only a 8GB phone, but didn't know that 8 GB is PRE GOOGLE BLOAT WARE. IMO, that's despicable business practices and false advertising. Google's bloat ware should be at their expense, not ours. I'm sure all mobile phone manufacturers do the same thing, but that doesn't make it ethical.Okay, for the good stuff... It's a pretty nice phone for $60! It's comfortable in my hand and functions well. I like the large Windows phone tiles better, but the small icons are okay. I like that the battery is replaceable... Though, there is no replacement battery available to buy! That too is despicable. It makes this phone disposable. The battery lastsme quite awhile. Yesterday at 10:00 am I started using it at 100% charge. At 6:15 pm I got the ""low battery"" alert and plugged it in. So 8 hours and 15 minutes of battery usage. One point though...I didn't use the phone at all for 2 hours yesterday while I was busy doing something else.I like that the phone shows the % of battery available. At 15% you're warned that it's low. It charges super fast. It was charged to 100% by 8:25 pm...2 hours and 10 minutes.I like the keyboard. It's much better than the Windows phone keyboard. Fewer typing mistakes. The power button and volume button function well.The phone functions well for me so far. Browsing the internet is pretty fast. Opening pages is fast enough. Not as fast as my laptop, but good enough for a $60 phone. To access the battery you need to pull the back off by working your fingernail under the bottom right corner. The back is said to be aluminum, but it feels and sounds like plastic to me. The gray colored phone is very nice. I like the color and finish.The phone came with earphones, a clear case and a screen protector. I'll never use the earphones and the screen protector was awful, so I bought a SuperShieldz tempered glass screen protector. The clear case works for me. My only nit on the case is the rough edge on the right side where my finger rubs as I scroll. I used an emery board to smooth off the rough edge and it's a little better. Usable. The case protects the phone, so I like it and it's clear, so it doesn't cover the pretty gray finish. The included booklet is useless. It tells you nothing about how to open the back to install the battery or how use the phone.Sim card slots...I have a TextNow sim card with an adapter in slot 2 and it works perfectly. I get text messages and phone calls with that Sim card. I couldn't use my Skpe on this phone because there isn't enough space available, so I went with a TextNow $13.99 subscription with sim card...not their free app. No more obnoxious ads. The other slot has my Verizon Sim card, but that doesn't work, so I'm basically just storing it there so I don't lose it. :) I don't need it, but hoped my contacts would load from it, but they didn't. I had to manually enter all my contacts which is because I use TextNow. Small price to pay for saving $1000 a year. :)I LOVE that Cloud printing was already on the phone so I didn't have to download KumoPrint and use up more space I don't have. Printing from my phone is soooo convenient. You need a wireless printer for that though.I didn't have to download 2 apps I wanted...KumoPrint and a Flashlight because this phone has a flashlight already and cloud printing. That was nice.I've used this for a week and haven't had any problems. I need it mostly for texting and an occasional phone call. That's it. If you need a basic phone only for minor use, this works. I don't like that there's no replacement battery available. That's just ridiculous. Why have a replaceable battery when you can't replace it? The Google bloat ware using up all my storage is pretty despicable, IMO. As long as the phone is usable, as is, it will be fine. Since there's no replaceable battery and charger available, I bought a battery bank to have available in case of power outages.Google/Blu customer service/tech help is nonexistent. Go to YouTube. I can see the lack of CS being a problem in the future and I don't like the fact that this is a disposable phone. I had my Windows phone for 5 years, so if this lasts that long I'll be happy. Getting 5 years out of this battery is highly doubtful and you can't replace it because they don't sell this battery.Okay...end of rambling review. :)If you need an inexpensive, unlocked phone for basic needs, this will suffice. If you want to cut the rip-off corporate mobile phone company ties...go to TextNow and buy their sim card and basic $13.99 a month service. Save a $1000 (at least) a year.Two stars deducted for lack of CS, no replacement battery &amp; and charger available and Google using up most of the 8 GB advertised before you even get the phone.Have a great day.On edit: I use my WiFi at home for internet access, calling and texting and when I leave the house, I use my Karma MiFi. Works like a charm.",2017年6月1日 在美国审核
Works great for a bit over a year.

You Will Likely Want Something Better,"(UPDATE: SD card functionality is better than I had thought.. three-stars to four. While it was hard to find, I'm new to Android, so...)The price is shockingly low. But it has insufficient internal storage (4GB which in practice means less than 500MB) to be super-useful these days. Count how many apps you have downloaded on your phone and need. If that number is more than 20, this phone is a hassle i.e. you will be deleting your cache, and swapping in/out unused apps all the time. (There is a setting to ""default"" to using the SD card . Settings:Storage, click the first ""Preferred install location"" text which doesn't look like a button at all. Specify SD Card in the pop-up.)You will still have to manually move apps to the SD card and occasionally clear your cache. (Or over time, you'll stop being able to update apps or install new ones.) Sometimes when apps update, they forget they need to move to the SD card. (Avast Mobile Security is making cleanup a little easier.)So why four-stars? It's cheap, it has worked pretty well so far, the camera is ok, and 15-20 apps is all I need.You should also plan on getting an SD card. Aim for 4 GB more than you want to use for your music and photos.It's my first Android phone; but it's ok. (Had to go to the AT&amp;T store to get a new SIM for it. Just swapping SIMs did not work. They didn't know why; it should have.)",2016年5月2日 在美国审核

It is getting better the more I'm finding out about it,"Well, first of all it was hard to open the back, had to take it to a cell phone store to have them open it, then for awhile there I could not answer any phone calls that came in, I don't know if I did that in the settings or not, but I did get that figured out, then I seem to have two screens when I turn it on, one is always, always advertising, then I press the bottom circle and get my HOME screen. All in all it has been a little irritating, I had to call my son just to find out things on it as I am almost 60 yrs old, this has been a different phone than what I am used to.

Barely good for basics,"I don't live on my phone, so simply needed one with a bit more intelligence and larger screen than I had with previous GO type phone.Being Amazon pushed this one and it had the simple features I needed at a cheap price, I bought it.It has good points and bad for sure.Good is price.Was easy to set up with a new carrier.Easy to get SIM card in.Looks nice.About as large a size as you can conveniently hold in hand or slip into some pockets.Android is not too bad to use, but not as smooth and friendly as IOS.Lots of apps out there for it.Down side to this phone are more than there should be, but again its all about price.If you don't add a memory card for storage, you will find you are out of space real quickly.More of these issues for me are things outside my initial requirements, but they may be important to others.Most disappointing item is the camera.It never focuses well nor does it get the F-stop correct so all photos are certainly not keepsakes.I stopped using it for anything except quick picts for sake of remembering something.Then there is Google.Granted Android is their OS, but every time I do something, they want to monitor it and collect it.I'm afraid to take this phone into the bathroom now.I have an Amazon Fire which is Android based, but Amazon did a good job of cleaning out much of that stuff.Yes, Amazon collects stuff as I roam and use apps, but I come to Amazon to shop so I expect they will monitor such stuff.Slowly, I am rooting out asmuch Google stuff as I can. Returning to the reasons I bought the phone (making calls, texting, GPS, and larger screen), I am not adding other apps or using additional features... except for my Starbucks app. Last issues are OS issues.Have found too much prompting to do things or change things and many apps do not operate consistently between themselves.Simple contacts app lacks some fields of info I want to collect that other similar apps allow.It makes it difficult to add persons to Groups.I hate to have to always be hunting Youtube (google) to find out how to do something simple in these apps.I'll keep it cus I don't need to be tethered to my phone and its an appliance to fit my needs rather than my lifeline to the world.12/10/2016 - UPDATE.I give up!This phone even for a cheap ""get what you paid for"" phone is unusable.Not certain if its the hardware, but the Android they use on it makes the phone unreliable and subject to random applications loss.It updates whenever some Android god decides it needs it.The result is purchased or downloaded apps can simply disappear and require reloading.The use of the optional SD card is a joke.Everyone, including Amazon, require their apps to stay in main memory.There is only 4GB in this phone so after the OS, Amazon apps, and of course Goooooogle apps crammed in there, your phone is totally constipated.Few apps will let you move them to the SD card.I have a 8GB card and all I can get over there is about 500Mb.Then the system runs out of memory so you can't play music or take photos or receive text messages.After all that, about all you can do is make phone calls.So, after struggling for about 5 months with this thing, I am tossing it out and going back to an iPhone.It will be a used/refurb cus, yes, I don't want to pay for one phone for the rest of my life.IOS may not be perfect, but its solid and not so bandaided together.",2016年7月30日 在美国审核
Well... Just read this first,"Ok, So i love this phone, this phone is pretty awesome. But i have some issues, well to begin with it is clearly a cheaper phone, although built beautifully and 100% worth the money, actually worth more than 1000% % worth it... but... corners are structurally weak, the glass is thick but it will break if you drop it at a waist height, highly recommend you pick up a decent case. Internal Storage SUCKS! only having 2gbs, and realistically actually more like 1.2gbs, ur gonna wanna pick up a SD card, and whenever you get and app, send it over to the SD card, cause omfg it will aggravate you...Supports 4g relatively well, but short bat life means ur phone will die and i mean fast.Having spare bats or a battery brick is a life saver. This phone is not for those of you who want to have a phone you can sit on for hours.I play Pokemon Go on this, with Bat Saver on and with the auto adjust back light (best feature ever) and i can go for about 2 hours with out shutting off the screen... Not the best ever, considering my brothers Note 6 goes for upwards of 7 hours...If you want this phone here is what you need16gb - 128gb SD (format it on the phone not computer)Battery pack (recommend a Solar panel carry along charger with battery built in)Tough CaseAnd Screen CoverIf you get this phone expectto spend and extra 100$ on accessories if your looking on the high end, maybe 60 low end all parts.",2016年7月17日 在美国审核

Highly disappointed,"In hindsight, I find it odd that the description doesn't refer to the phone as new or refurbished though the box to the right when an order is placed shows as ""Buy New"". I ordered on 8/7 and received the phone on 8/12 and as the fine print says somewhere, it was the phone only. No charger, no complimentary ear buds, no accessories period. I was still ok considering the price and that it takes a standard charger which I have plenty of (2.0 micro USB).The worst part was how the phone was locked even though it's advertised as UNLOCKED. I needed a PIN to even begin set up and tried every default PIN imaginable with no success. I contacted Amazon and they suggested that I could either return it, exchange it or contact the BLU manufacturer for assistance. I don't give up easily plus my daughter was so excited to use the phone so I called BLU technical service and after being on hold for 30 minutes and talking with a rep for another 20 minutes, it was determined that I could not use the phone. The BLU rep helped me perform a hard reset which bypassed the PIN screen but the Google sync set-up blocked me again. The message said to enter the Google account info previously synced on the phone. I tried my own information to no avail and the rep determined that the phone couldn't be new if it was already previously synced to someone's Google account. As diehard as I am, I scoured the internet for solutions to bypass the sync but nothing worked. 2 hours of my Saturday wasted trying to make this phone work.I am in the process of returning the phone and as always, Amazon's return policy is generous and easy which has been the most pleasant part of this transaction. I'm glad for all the people who received new, unlocked, easy to set up phones; that just wasn't the case for me and the time and energy spent earned this product 1 star to me.",2016年8月16日 在美国审核

Nice phone but check with your carrier first.,"This was an excellent phone and unfortunately I had to return it. I called the local AT&amp;T store to see if they could activate the phone. One rep from the store said YES on the phone but when I got there the answer became NO. It wasn't compatible with their network. The same could be said for Tracfone in my area. What a disappointment!There really isn't a way to check before placing the order with Amazon because it depends on the IMEI number on each phone and many Amazon customer reviews were hit and miss with that info. The phone was fast, great resolution and looked similar to an iPhone 6. I do want to mention how great the customer service was at Amazon when I needed to return the phone.

Useless as a smartphone...,"Although the look and feel are nice (the camera is decent, too), this phone is completely useless as a smartphone. The 4GB you start with --meaning more than half of that is eaten up from the get-go for normal running of the phone-- is a joke, and adding an SD card won't help because it's not possible to move the majority of apps to external storage. Forget about updating any of the apps that are crucial to the functioning of the phone --not enough storage. I can't even get the proper up-to-date tools to connect to my WIFI, which requires PAP-TTLS authentication --no option to change from the default security setting. I wasn't able to install any apps that I consider very basic and use on a daily basis -- for reading, music, messaging, banking, tracking exercise, etc. --storage will be full once you install a handful of run-of-the-mill apps.If you are among those whose needs are served by this phone, I'm going to guess you probably wouldn't be interested in trying to force the phone to install the apps to external storage by default. The phone needs to be rooted and the ADB devices set to external. Not worth all the work!",2016年3月31日 在美国审核
Very good phone with hopes of making it a great phone with some mods,"This is an amazing phone for the price. Very fast, but with limited memory. It started running out of memory as soon as my applications started downloading to the phone. But...once I was able to reduce the memory usage on it, it worked absolutely fine and ran very fast. I watched video on it and all of the applications I did have left on it after deleting the ones that would not run now the phone runs fine. The screen is plenty bright and calls sound fine on it.I did temporarily put a 2 gig SANDISK SD Memory card in it and that helped with the memory situation temporarily. But I am not going to push it. For now, it runs great for everything I am using it for. I do have hopes that this will be a great phone instead of a very good one, so I ordered a Samsung EVO+ 64GB Class 10 UHS-1 SDXC Memory Card for delivery next week. This was based on a review up here by PeterF. Thank you Peter!From everything I can see this is a well built phone with all the functionality of a more expensive one. You will however, probably be stuck at Android 5.1 with no hope of an update to a newer version of Android. Android 5.1 is a very good operating system though, but there won't be any additional security updates to it.One note...Please take note BLU...I had a heck of a time getting the SIM cards into this phone. I have nano SIMs and when I put them into an adapter, THEY WOULD NOT FIT. I spent hours trying to get those things in there without damaging the phone. I have never had this problem with a GSM phone before. You need more clearance for those SIM cards! Also, please take note, SIM1 is a micro SIM and SIM2 is a standard SIM. Nowhere in the documentation is this mentioned.From what I understand I can use the program lnk2sd and root the phone to allow the 64GB memory card to be used as phone memory. It is not the greatest solution, but if it works I think this phone will really rock. I'll post the results after I do that next week.",2016年9月29日 在美国审核

Great for the Price,"This is actually my third BLU phone. I got a BLU Advance 4.0 last year, and got another one for my wife, and got this one to replace my 4.0.Let me start by saying that you have to grade this phone on a curve. When you compare the Advance to iPhones or Galaxy S phones, it's not that great. Like many have said, the memory is only about 1GB. You can install some small apps for that size like Facebook and WhatsApp, but games are going to push it. You'll spend a lot of time uninstalling apps or deleting photos or declining updates on apps because it's low on storage. The camera is not that good. I don't take a lot of photos, but the ones I do don't come out that well. Kind of blurry or low resolution. The screen is okay, but not that great. In bright sunlight, it can be hard to see the screen. Videos and games look okay, but not that bright. Sound can be kind of soft, especially if you're playing videos or listening to music. I often have to cup my hand around the speaker to hear it.That being said, for the price, I think this is the best unlocked phone you can buy. The phone is fairly speedy without much lag. Calls are clear. The OS is solid with minimal changes from stock. The screen is huge for a $60 unlocked phone - most phones in this price range are smaller or crappier. It works without having to constantly restart or factory reset it. I've had cheaper phones and even more expensive phones that were far worse.

The BLU R1 HD is a much better choice for Pokemon Go.,"My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy Mini that I got as a hand me down Christmas before last. It was about the same size as the phone I had before, but without the slide-out keyboard. I had plenty of social media and game apps on it. I am not really a gamer, but I want to be able to pass the time well, when stuck somewhere waiting. Ticket To Ride, Small World, Elder Sign: Omens, Star Wars Angry Birds 1 &amp; 2.But when Pokemon Go dropped and it was all anyone could talk about, I wanted to play it, but my Galaxy Mini had an incompatible version of the Android OS. So I looked online and the Blu Advance 5.0 was the recommendation for the cheapest Android that could run Pokemon Go.The website was correct that this phone can download and install Pokemon Go, but playing Pokemon Go is another matter. The game crashes nearly continuously. The game quickly gives up on tracking your progress on the map as you move. Eventually the game wouldn't load and I went back to my Galaxy Mini.I am unsure why any company thinks it can put out a phone with a 4 or 5 GB hard drive.With so little room, I was only able to load half of my social media apps, and none of the other games.Alas the Galaxy Mini was too small and I missed the auto correct so I found a better phone. The BLU R1 HD. A hard drive 4 times the size and a faster processor. Now I can have all of the apps I care about and Pokemon Go runs flawlessly. It was like I was playing the game on hard mode before.And if you get the BLU R1 HD with the ads, it is about the same price BLU Advance 5.0.",2016年9月12日 在美国审核

Does work for Pokemon Go BUT,"I give this 3 starsbecause it is a nice phone. Way better than the phone I had before and u honestly can't beat that price.I go this for Pokemon Go and the game will download and play BUT, there is no Gyroscope so u cannot use the AR feature in game. Also ur character does not move with u. It will update where u r when u move to a new location, but doesn't actually walk and turn when u do. Makes hatching eggs difficult.Onto the phone itself, it has an incredibly small amount of storage. I had 3 apps downloaded and then an update happened for the Google play store and suddenly had no more room on the phone!!Also, u cannot get rid of the Google bar unless u download an app from the Google play store to hide it. Which takes up space of course.And the camera isn't all that impressive.So I say, for a cheap phone it's decent. Light, nice looking. Very nice touch sensitivity.But if u can afford to put a little more into it, get a more expensive phone",2016年7月23日 在美国审核
"Works great,  Would buy again","Purchased this phone to replace a Samsung Note 1,yes the original note.The old phone works fine, but to slow.For the new phone, I wanted something that was unlocked and could handle 2 phone numbers.Probably the best purchase I've made in a long time.Phone works great and have used now for several months without issue.With the new OS, the phone is fast and feature packed.Don't see a reason to pay 600-700 for a phone when this has the same whistles and bells, which I'll probably never use.The new phone uses a smaller sim, so I stopped at the AT&amp;T store and they gave me a replacement sim (free), I popped it in phone and ready to go.Haven't dropped from 6 feet or dropped it in the sink, or thrown it at one of my kids (yet), but there is always tomorrow.Would recommend this phone to folks that want a nice phone and is affordable.UPDATE: (Mar 16, 2016) Purchased a second phone for one of the kids and I had concerns about the phone because it was shipped (Amazon shipping) in a box 4x the size of the factory phone box without packing.So the phone was rattling in the box during shipping.So far the phone is working as designed, but disappointed with the packing by Amazon",2017年3月14日 在美国审核

Would not recommend this phone,"Would not recommend this phone. Initially, my mom received this phone and loved it. She said the screen was good sized. And the touch screen was very people friendly. After having this phone for less than two weeks the memory completely crippled it. She downloaded Snap Chat, and Instagram and immediately got a notification that she had no memory left. Google chrome needed to be updated in order to use the internet but the phone had no memory to update. After putting a 32G Micro SD in the phone, the phone would not recognize the SD and will not use it as a ""source"" no matter how many times you reset the phone or attempt managing settings. Then, her text messages stopped going through. It would only send to certain providers. She called her phone company and they were not the issue. All in all, the phone looks great but the internal memory ruins this phone. I'm highly disappointed as this was a birthday present, that she now cannot even use. The glass screen is large, but cheap.

I really did not like this phone,"I really did not like this phone. I needed a temporary loaner. I though that based on the advertising that this is only 60 bucks that it would be a few notches decent than the Tracfone. The posting of it's advertising data said that it could do much. Though honestly, I sent it back after it kept lagging on load, when you could barely install apps on it because despite it has 4.0gb it's only like a gig or so of it is usable. The camera was actually decent though. I mean for the price, it was responsive and well ok and took okay video. The phone's build though feels so hollow. Dual SIM I never got to test out but Im sure it worked. The phone is also indeed unlocked. 2.5 stars by me because I think my phone from 2013 can run better than this (that was like 120-130 bucks but also a nothing-special no brand made in china CPUs). So if that can still run better than this then there is something wrong.Again, if you want a basic phone with basic android. Than I suppose you can get this.

Horrible battery life and an incredibly hard to open back cover.,"Edit: I gave it one last try before boxing up the phone for return and was finally able to get it open. I shouldn't have bothered. It was a wasted effort. Once installed the battery was at 68% out-of-the box. I left it alone on my desk because I was busy with other things and when I came back to it, it was at 8%. This phone drained 60% of it's battery in 3 hours while in STANDBY. There was no SIM installed, bluetooth turned off, and only wifi turned on and it drained in less than 3 hours. I was so shocked that I fully recharged the phone to 100% and left it alone again. Without touching it, the phone had almost completely drained (to 3%) in 5 hours. Again, because this is very important, this is while the phone is in STANDBY. That means in actual use this phone would last, maybe, 3 hours at best. That is ridiculous.I sure would love to review how well this phone performs but the back is impossible to get off. I tried so hard that my nail broke.

The little notch where I presume your supposed to open it is right above the screen itself, perfect opportunity for a slipped screwdriver or other tool scratching your screen. Dumb design.The only reason I bought this thing was because the usb jack on my previous phone, the superior BLU Studio X Plus was getting worn out and the repair people said it would cost 89 bucks to fix (which they couldnt, because everyone only works on Samsung and Apple phones).Filed a return request on the same day and will just tough it out with my current phone until later.EDIT: I did FINALLY manage to get the case open by prying along the corners with my fingernails, not the stupid notch. But it doesnt matter, because even after an hour of charging the phone wouldnt even turn on, despite the red light on the front telling me it was charging.

I was ready to give up and just send the phone in for a refund till I remembered my brand new memory card was in there so I had to kill my nails and fight with this thing for about 10 minutes to finally get it open. It doesn't matter if maybe taking the battery in and out would fix it, I'm not fighting this thing anymore. Back it goes. It had its chance. And now I have a memory card I don't need, not to mention having to pay return shipping for a case I bought because Blu didn't bother to mention that this phone already comes with a case.Also the user manual is pathetic and is not even posted on Blu's website, so you better download it here if you're still going to buy this phone.",2017年7月4日 在美国审核
Good for what it is,"This is a great phone with a few caveats. First, it's not an LTE device, despite the ""4G"" in the description. It supports HSPA, which is really just the high end of 3G. Make sure your carrier supports at least one of the 3G frequencies on which it operates (850/1700/1900), particularly if you are going to use it outside of the US*. Secondly, with only 4GB of on-board storage, after all of the ""essential"" Google apps, you will have little room to install your own apps. I found I could only get 4-5 apps of my own on the device until I got storage space exhausted errors (before using an SD card). So you will want to insert a 8G or 16 GB microSD card, and make sure all of your photos and music end up on it. Then, favor apps that you can move to the SD card and/or limit yourself to a small number of them.If you can live within these limitations, then the phone works quite well.*For example: I used this phone in Australia on Optus' network. Until they shut down their 2G network, and the phone stopped working.

"Slow, low storage, barely a smart phone","This phone is probably the worst phone I have ever owned.Pros:You can text and call others with itIt can connect to the internetIt is cheapCons:-The 4GB storage allowed me to download 6 apps, no more. I have virtually nothing else on my phone, still only 6 apps because I am out of storage. The phone even has trouble updating the apps. I have to go in and delete cached data every day just to update.-The default text message app is awful for group messages. The interface and way it displays and shows your own messages within the group message forced me to have to download another texting app, which of course took more storage- Using anything is painfully SLOW. Reminds me of using dial-up connection, but it is slow for everything. Even programs that arent using the internet. Just opening an app can take up to a minute at times. This is really bad when you are trying to use a ""maps"" app- I can only run 1-2 things at a time. For example, if I am listening to Pandora and try to use the web browser then Pandora shuts down.

"Not bad, but you get what you pay for",This is a functional Android smartphone. The issues are that the phone does not have enough memory to do most of what you want to do with a smart phone. Picks up fingerprints quite a bit and the rear cover cracked easily. The memory is only expandable to 64 gigs and most apps will not use the memory card so you have a very limited amount to install applications.,2016年9月18日 在美国审核

Fun while it lasted,"I initially was happy with the product. I bought this the end of June and now it's September, less than three months ownership. I added a memory card, but still had storage issues. Camera worked fine. Problem happened overnight when charging. The next morning, I try the camera and it has a notification that I should turn off any apps using the flashlight.I go into the area where I can swipe any running pages/apps and none are there. I go into my settings and see the flashlight is gone all together.Googling the problem says to go to widgets and grab it again, to come to realize that three pages are missing including all my widgets, there's no way I have been able to get them again. So the phone is basically wasted. I did a factory reset and the problem still exists.Another issues I had when I purchased the phone, when I had two blue four before I was able to use blue tooth and copy the contacts, not with this model.

Adding storage does not help,"This is basically useless as a smartphone. I bought it and a 64gb sd card which worked perfectly but despite that the internal storage is so low that installing just a few apps overloads it. I even went so far as to root the phone and try every trick I could find to shift storage to the sd card but it simply does not work. I was able to install a few more apps that way but it was still destined to run out of space since some app code will still remain on the internal side, besides that needing to root to get a phone to work is not at all reasonable.If you want to use it as a phone only then it will work as well as you expect from a budget phone but if you expect to have the freedom to install what you like then don't get it.I was also bothered by the touch screen. It requires a fairly hard press and not just making contact so you can't take a photo without moving it and making the already not great picture blurry. I also found it registering my attempts to scroll as taps pretty often and annoyingly opening links I didn't intend to.As a phone it works really well for calls and texts. I like how big and readable the text is in the default messaging app.If this ever upgrades to marshmallow it could be a great budget phone since in that version of the OS you can treat an sd card as your internal storage. Until then this is an un-usable product. I have returned it.",2016年2月17日 在美国审核

I don't know if this is a malfunction of my device or if is a common behaviour for this phone. I'm waiting the sdCard to test the device properly.I will update this review when i get the sdCard****Update***I haven't got my SDcard, but i put another one that i had and i keep having the same problem, then i realized that the problem wasn't the memory (altough it's really annoying that when it's full you don't get any message, whatsaap, or notification until you free some space, even the phone doesn't notificate that has no memory left) the problem is when the phone has low battery (about 10% left) or its fully charged/charging. I think its a malfunction in my device, i have to reset it and then keep the phone unlocked about 5 to 10 minutes, so then it would work. For me it's really annoying, because i have to keep reseting the device every nigth or morning when i'm gonna use it, and i can't use it when it's charging because the screen doesn't turn onthe moment i plug the power cordand i don't know if reseting the device so many times or when it's charging could cause any damage.***Update*******I've talked with amazon abut the malfunction on the phone and because i'm out of USA and will be very difficult for me to send it back to review the roblem, they send me another one for free. I'll expect it arrives and give feedback.I'm still using the malfucntion phone and really the only complain that i have is the issue of the screen when it's charging or running low on battery. I haven't experienced lag on the phone yet.Also i already put the 16GB micro SD card and runs really well.

BEAUTIFUL Phone with Numereous Features,"This beautiful sleek white phone is my second BLU phone purchase and a perfect addition since I now carry two phones. It has two Sim card slots that can be used to add a second cell number for convenience or while traveling outside the USA / internationally. Using a second Sim will save a tremendous amount of money on phone expenses, especially in Mexico where the last resort I stayed in charged $95.00 per minute [in their currency] - that's right ninety-five dollars! Before you travel internationally, check with your carrier to determine whether you need a International Sim card or if your regular Sim will do the job. Also, my first BLU phone automatically transferred my entire phone book to this new BLU phone and all I did was charge them side-by-side. When finished, there was my entire phone book on the new phone - Voi La! You will LOVE this phone!",2016年3月21日 在美国审核

This phone will not upgrade to Android 6.0 Marshmallow... and that's a problem.,"The reason I don't like it is I cannot upgrade the OS to Marshmallow 6.0. That is not available for this model. As is, it will not load new apps or other needed upgrades to the sd card, only to the phone storage, which was full very quickly. The phone is priced right and works well in all ways, but without being able to add useful apps and features it is (almost) a total frustration. Apparently the BLU Advance 5.0 HD does not have this problem (for about $10 more). The reason I don't like it is I cannot upgrade the OS to Android 6.0 Marshmallow which would supposedly correct the main problem of where new apps and files are stored on the phone.3/3/2017 I am back here looking at reviews again and noticing that reviews for different phones are being provided mixed together, making this a confusing mess. The reviews seem to be mixed up due to similar model names. I am seeing my review and others for the BLU Advance 5.0, along with a review for the Advance 5.0 HD, and starting from the listing for the Advance 5.5 HD. My phone still works well and has the same limitations. BLU did contact me through this review and said they were sorry... Me too.",2016年12月27日 在美国审核

Avoid like the plague,"Got this phone back in February. Just the other day, the firmware decided to corrupt unexpectedly. I've already contacted customer support and tried every solution that my years of computer experience could muster, and still no results. There is lack of support for the phone overall, and their own webpage has no tools for recovery, or even tips on what to do when this phone malfunctions.The 8gb internal memory drive is completely hosed with bloatware what can't be deleted, and you'll soon find yourself having to tediously move every app you download to an SD card manually. Exterior speaker is cheap and nearly silent, and the EQ is ear-shatteringly unbalanced. The touch screen is unresponsive sometimes, making the already clunky menus harder to navigate; and get this, the recovery menu has the volume buttons navigate the list for you, with power to select, and by power to select, they mean volume up. This was NOT a product up to scratch, and should be considered a foul impersonation of an Android phone at best, you're much better off using a brick as a phone, because at least that would be more reliable.",2016年4月15日 在美国审核

You get what you pay for...,"This phone gives you VERY basic functions.It's fine for basic texting and apps, but load it up with apps, and you'll be in trouble.The most disappointing feature is the TERRIBLE camera.Photos are extremely grainy even at highest resolution, and the camera app itself is very twitchy.But what do you expect for this price?I would consider this a disposable phone...if I get a year out of it, I'd be surprised.It's good on battery use, but that's not surprising considering you can't run much on it.It locks up on most internet apps, especially youtube and even google.Did work well on switching networks traveling between US and Canada.The phone app is horrible..tapping on a contact, rather than bringing up the contact info,instead immediately calls the contact.Not cool.On the plus side, the BLU comes with very few bloatware apps...much appreciated.I guess I would say it's a good stop-gap phone before deciding to invest in a more robust one.Charging is fast and good and the charging port is particularly tight and good...a major complaint of mine with multiple Samsung Galaxies that had flimsy charging ports that failed in a matter of weeks. Phone call sound and quality is quite good.I guess, the thing is, for $60 or so, that's what you get.UPDATE - the charging port on this phone failed in just over one month.Attempts to reach customer support on this and other issues with the phone resulted in ""clear cache and reboot phone"" type responses.

Surprisingly good smartphone considering its price.,"Purchased the phone for my grandmother and she seems to like it. Its not the fastest or smoothest phone on the market, but it was easy to set up and does most of the basics well; It even runs Mario Run for Android pretty well. Some of the issues I had was occasional sticky performance when switching apps and disastrous haptic feedback when typing. Other issues I had was language support and minor glitches when web browsing. For under 100 dollars, its pretty hard to beat. Build quality is quite sturdy and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. Its alright but the back cover is extremely difficult to remove.If you're looking for a budget phone, this one is hard to beat despite the minor flaws and occasional performance hiccups.

And out of all the parts you don't want to skimp on in a cell phone. Antenna should be the #1 part to spend the money on.The last blu phone had great reception. This one sucks. Your call might be spotty just standing under a tree or walking inside a building could drop your call.It is unlocked and it's a dual sim card.

It's a great buy.,"This is a very great phone, in my opinion. For starters, the design is sleek but able to fit snug in your hand. It's a big phone, meaning that if you ever want to use it with both hands, have at it. It's an Android phone with the newest OS. It has a decent amount of internal storage. With that being said, an SD card may be necessary for someone who likes to play games and watch movies. It's a fast-acting phone, meaning that whether it's hot or cold, it'll move at your speed.The dual sims are a nice touch as well. Basically, if you have two phone lines in which you'd want to text two people, all you'd need to do it switch and you'll be on your merry way.There's not much else I can add other than that it's a very good phone, and it's worth the investment.",2016年7月14日 在美国审核

Metro PCS Customers - Please read this first!!!,"I had to edit my initial post because this phone (BLU 5.5 HD) is compatible with Metro PCS. Their website says it isn't but I finally was able to call them and they can activate any unlocked phone. People rag on Metro but I can't complain.Ok Negatives - It gets hot real quick. Move your fingers and put it on speaker hot. And it took too long to get here. It has 4/8 GB bloat ware when you rcv it. I wonder if the 16 GB wld hv been smarter.I read some google reviews on this phone. DOB 2014, the battery will need replacement. Top complains are about things that are technical, if you know about phones what I read wasn't don't buy me issues. You can google and figure it out. The setup is a bit tricky. If its not done right things will malfunction.Positives - The phone walks you through set up, follow, read and do not skip steps. Oh, and activate your warranty in the BLU app installed on the phone. I found that after doing this everything runs smoother. At first it wldnt connect my google account during set up, but I just went directly to gmail from the gmail app and it pulled it all together.The phone is nice looking, gold, and fits in one hand. Its alot lighter than my last phone. The screen is a nice size, very very clear and everything runs well. Marshmallow 6.0. It had no instructions when I rvcd it. Now, my father told me never to buy a car without a manual or floor mates because something was up, so, I'm weird anyway. But wheres my manual! It arrived in a nice little tamper stickered box, with a free case, a nice already attached screen protector, a charger, and ear phones. So, for me this phone might have been returned, but it was 60 bucks and I could have blown that on dinner and two drinks, or some nice red shoes. I like red.Oh, and the battery is removable. I do not like the phones with monitor you batteries. I like to disconnect.I downloaded Walking Dead, Super Mario Bros, and some farming and building games to see what's really up. All good. Took it a lil bit to download, poor thing. But, she's good. All the games play, very nice. I need to find out what kind of glass this is bcuz the graffic are popping off the screen. No buffering. I'm rcvg emails, text, calls, all at the same time. I haven't opened Facebook or Instagram but I don't like those apps either. Social media can be work.In real life, I do not have time to play these games but I'm home on disability for a few more weeks -- broken leg. This is a test I run on any new phone to see what happens.One thing, my SD card... Its blown, its reading corrupt, but I think I might have scratched it pulling it out of my old phone. It was only 8 GB and I want to geta 32 or 64 GB sd, which is also a positive possibility with this phone you know, to see how much better it runs.So, its doing all this on 4 GB.If you can't dig this phone ur just spoiled, superficial about name brands and you must enjoy spending your hard earned money.

JUST SOME NOTES,"When purchasing this phone, I think it's important to understand the specs. For those who may be uncomfortable or unfamiliar trying to understand what exactly that entails, I'll try to keep it simple.Network connectivity.This phone is not compatible with an LTE network. It's range only extends to 4G, so your internet connectivity is going to be limited. That means that downloads will be slower, streaming things like Netflix / Hulu / Youtube when you're not connected to WiFi will sometimes be impossible, and will be low quality most of the time.Internal Memory.Unless you purchase an SD card separately (a lot of phones come with one, this one does not) you will only have enough space for (MAYBE) 2 apps from the app store. If you attempt to fully use all of your internal memory, your text messages will cease alerting you, phone calls will not come in properly, etc.Bluetooth.I've had a lot of trouble connecting via bluetooth devices, be it to my fitbit or to my car stereo. The phone is too weak and has trouble finding devices.Wi-Fi.As a phone that depends almost entirely on WiFi, I expected this phone to have a capable antenna. It does not. My phone frequently loses wifi connection despite the fact that my internet operates at 400 mbps. I don't have problem connecting to other devices. Just the phone. Even when connected to WiFi, my phone will frequently use personal data while maintaining that's connected to WiFi. For people using limited data plans with their personal carriers, this could definitely cause a problem in the future.CAMERA;the camera is ... acceptable. It's not the worst camera that i've used, but it's not the best. The lighting is adequate in daylight, but taking a photo requires you to stay still for a minimum of 2 seconds after the snapshot has been taken otherwise it'll result in blurry or distorted photos.",2017年11月13日 在美国审核

There are other issues with pics involving DOWNLOAD, GALLERY, AND FILE MANAGER that would take too long to describe here. Overall I find the BLU Android OS less intuitive for me than the Windows OS on Nokia 635 but Window OS (mobile) has some significant IE problems.Bottomline:if you are wanting a decent smartphone with Android OS and sharp pics are less important to you, this might be a good choice for you.",2017年3月28日 在美国审核

"It could be better, even for $60","I got this phone mostly for Snapchat but also because I was calling and texting with an LG Chocolate (look it up) and wanted to upgrade. I chose it because I figured it would do everything a $200+ phone would and...well, it could be better.Short review (""*"" means there is more info in the long review):Pros-*It functions quite well-It's a $60 dollar phone-*Dual SIM card slots! Use them to impress your friends and troll your enemies!-You can listen to the radio if you have headphones (cool feature but not a reason to buy)Cons-*Battery life could be better (but it's $60)-Camera could be better (again, it's $60)-*Internal storage $ucks (even if it's $60)Long review:The only reason I'm not giving it 1-2 stars is because it's only a $60 phone! I'm a college student so I'd say I'm pretty qualified to say that that's not a bad price for a phone. It runs about as well as you expect a phone to. Snapchat can run slowly on it, sometimes, though rare, even crashing when loading filters. But other than that, it connects to wifi, thereby giving you access to the entirety of the behemoth we call the internet. There isn't much that this phone can't functionally do. More on that later.I have not activated this phone for service, so I do not consider myself qualified to discuss the use of dual SIM cards, though it seems like a very fun and useful feature.The battery lasts long enough for me to get through the day and has yet to run out on me, but that may change with time (I have had the phone for almost 4 months).Finally, my biggest complaint about this phone is the internal storage. You get 4 GB of internal storage, but the memory can be expanded (I have a 32 GB memory card and it helps a lot). However, no matter how big of a card you get, all your apps are stored internally. This has restricted me so that I have only downloaded 7 apps over the span of owning this phone; as much as I would like to get more apps, I cannot. The ""memory full"" message has been such a pain in the butt that I have almost considered buying another phone to use for actual phone things (texting, calling, etc) and use this one for web-surfing and games.Conclusion: If you're looking for an affordable phone to perform basic phone functions on a smartphone platform, this is for you, but I would recommend you get a memory card for pictures/videos and just go easy on the apps (Snapchat takes up a lot of space).",2017年3月7日 在美国审核

I see in some reviews that they can't see the difference between this phone an a more expensive phone like my LG V10 was but let me assure you there are many differences in quality.My first complaint is the touch screen glitches in a way that when scrolling thru Facebook it constant thinks I'm clicking on things when I'm not. So that's annoying.8GB internal storage is extremely small even by 2012 standards.The camera is really not as good as i'm used to.SD card must be formatted before use.SD card must be married to device to be used as internal storage. (it will no longer work with other devices)Battery must be removed to remove SD card.Feels like you're breaking the phone every time you take the back cover off.Will get rid of this phone as soon as AT&amp;T will let me upgrade.,2016年12月16日 在美国审核

Unreliable long term performance,"Its screen went black - would not light-up, after 2 months' use. Removing and replacing the battery made it come on for a while. Finally I read on YouTube a fix, where it was reconnected to a PC and after a few minutes it seemed to revive. I think part of the problem was the use of two separate SIM cards. Although it was designed for it, and had a way to switch from one to another, for some reason it ""preferred"" one. Eventually it worked by removing one SIM card and sticking with the other. Not a happy situation, but it works with one - too late to return it, also. (The whole thing very confusing to someone unfamiliar with computer technology.)",2017年2月21日 在美国审核

Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen ...,"For $70 I think you are getting your money's worth.The phone comes with a case, plastic screen protector, earphones, microUSB cable, and an outlet adapter.Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen protector as even people who are in the market for budget phones will typically have to buy those as well. For the price, or even for double the price, I don't think there are many phones that have much better specs.The newest version android, quad core 1.3ghz processor, 1gb ram, ~294 pixels per inch, and weighing in at only 142g.I've noticed some reviews saying they had trouble opening the back of the phone to insert the battery. They are right that there are no direct instructions provided for that which certainly should have been included in a start-up manual.If you look at the phone with the screen towards you, in the top right corner of the phone has a small indent that should allow you to open the back with a low to medium amount of force.The phone itself looks nice and runs pretty smoothly.I've maybe noticed a slight lag when opening some programs for the first time in a while.I've also noticed some widgets are not properly responsive if you don't open the program for that widget before hand.Not sure if that's an issue with the phone itself, the OS, or the apps, though it's likely not the apps.If you have very basic phone needs, this phone is a prime choice especially since you don't have to buy a screen or case.As for the earphones, I would have gladly paid something like $3 less and not have received those.Also, since there's a Pokemon GO craze going on right now, this phone can play the game but not on the augmented reality mode since I do not believe it contains a gyroscope.I've only had the phone for about five days so I will update the review if my opinions change on it.Edit 1:Have had the phone for almost three weeks now and am still very satisfied with my purchase.I forgot to mention what carrier I am using.I am on T-mobile and everything seems to work just fine, even though on the compatibility rating it says ""partial"" coverage for 3G and no coverage for 4G.I'm sure there is a very technical explanation for all this, but my phone usually tells me I'm on 3G or 4G when I'm not connected to wifi.Battery life seems to be pretty good.Edit 2:Have had the phone for a month now and still like it a lot.I am having some issues with the headphone jack, however.When I plug in my headphones, sometimes it doesn't register to the phone for some reason and while sound comes out of the headphones, it doesn't cancel the sound coming out of the speaker.I've tested this with multiple pairs of headphones so it seems to be a problem with the outlet.If I plug the headphones in slowly then it works fine.",2016年7月30日 在美国审核

A piece of junk,I purchased this phone in March for my mom.She was reluctant about using a smart phone as she's up in age.She finally had the phone activated in August.So in a short span of 2 months the phone rings when it feels like it. 85% of the time with incoming and outgoing calls you can't hear the person on the other end; you literally have to hang up and call the person back about 3 times for successful communication.Any pictures received by text messages need to be downloaded.I would have returned the phone but unfortunately I live in another state so it would've been challenging to do so.,2017年10月7日 在美国审核

This phone is not worth your money.,"This is a terrible phone. I know it's low-priced, but even judging it on that curve, it's just plain bad.The first phone I got couldn't be charged. It kept saying that the battery temperature was too low (whatever that means), and so it wouldnt allow the phone to be charged. I called customer service, but they couldn't help (hint: you probably know you're buying a piece of junk when the front of the phone's box has the customer service number and says please call customer service before returning the phone).I got a replacement from Amazon (great service). Knowing that the phone has hardly any internal memory, I installed an internal 16GB SD card that I had lying around. Guess what? The phone won't allow you to store apps or app data on the phone. Just photos and music. So, here I am, with 16GB of memory, but the phone can't update my email or whatsapp because the internal memory is full.I have Whatsapp, Facebook and Skype apps on my phone. That's it. And the phone won't work, because the memory is full. Again, there is 16GB of additional memory in there, but you can only use it for photos and music.Did I mention that the battery life is awful?Did I mention that the sound quality for regular conversations is bad?Pay the extra money for something else.

Originally I thought maybe she was inadvertently hitting the volume button on accident or the volume was turned down, but after checking the volume settings and making sure the volume was as loud as it could go, I realized the problem was the phone itself! The volume is extremely low even on the maximum setting, which basically requires you to talk on speaker phone all the time!

Would be a decent phone if it worked,"I bought this phone in February and I am already going to get rid of it. I previously had a Blu Studio 5.0C HD which I loved, but had to replace after breaking the screen and unfortunately I bought this piece of junk. Right from when I got the phone, I had issues receiving texts messages. I could only receive messages if I texted someone first and they replied within a few hours. I tried re-configuring the APN (which worked for about a day) then did a factory reset, which fixed the texting issue but seemed to delete the software that recognizes the front camera. Since then, texting stopped working again and now my phone calls automatically hang up after an hour, and sound has been cutting in and out sporadically during calls as well. Needless to say that overall I am very disappointed with this phone, especially since I had a pretty high opinion of Blu products beforehand.There are good things about the phone, but if you don't want to risk getting a phone that does not work then I would recommend buying something else.",2017年6月25日 在美国审核

I had an issue where it wouldn't turn on for a 1/2 day, restarting, factory restarting, called the service team and had to wait 30 minutes to get a hold of them, and then that issue was resolved. If you don't put a code on your phone, you will send random letter text messages/snaps to anybody on your phone. You will also have to wait a decent amount of time before you can switch between apps because the processor isn't the best.

VERY UNREASONABLE POLICY since I have spent all this time and effort trying to get their product to work. Wasted time-wasted money. Lesson learned: Never buy a phone from Amazon.

"Do Not, I Repeat, DO NOT Buy this Phone","When I first got this phone it was fine for about two weeks and then it started to become very slow when doing anything, (texting, calling, browsing, etc.)I had also purchased a memory card for it because it only has 4 gb worth of storage on the actual phone, which is mostly taken up by the useless apps that you can't delete.At first the memory card was working great, I could now download as many apps and store as much music as I wanted without it taking up all of my storage.However, this soon started to fail as well.Even though the phone said it was storing all of my apps and music on my memory card, every time I tried to download another app it would say I didn't have enough storage and I had to delete something.Now I can only have two apps beyond what's already stored on the phone and constantly have to delete one if I want to download another for any reason. This phone may seem like a steal because it is a smart phone and it's pretty cheap for one at that, but this phone is absolute garbage.I've never had a phone that made me want to throw it at a wall so much in my life.My advice to you, if it's money you're trying to save like I was just get a flip phone and call it a day.It will save you a lot of frustration and headache, trust me.",2017年9月21日 在美国审核

Half advertised specs. Freezing handset out of box.,"Would absolutely not recommend this product to anyone. I purchased it last week to replace a broken phone in a pinch. It did not work from the get go. Crashed about every 20 minutes. Sometimes I could not get it to turn on for an extended period of time. I worked with amazon tech support to try to remedy the issue. They could not fix it and the tech said and i quote ""It really shouldn't be doing that"" at one point. So they sent me a replacement no charged. The problem? It was broken in the EXACT SAME WAY as the first phone. In addition I found that the second phone was not as averted, an internal menu showed the phone had 2 GB of internal memory not 4.

No, he didn't forget it or enter it wrong, the phone just didn't recognize it. Next, minor problems like poor UI on mms texting (issues saving pictures sent through text) and dark screen lighting, and now the kicker - after 2 days of use, the touch screen has become unresponsive. We can't even get it to factory reset to see if that will help. So now my husband is without a phone until we can send it in and claim insurance on it. Buyer beware!

Now that I understand what a smartphone is -  I love it.,"First, I want to apologize to BLU.i wrote a one star review - subsequently deleted(i hope) - because I did not understand what I was buying.This is my first smart phone.I went with a relatively inexpensive product because it was to be a learning 'phone'.I'm a tech savvy user of various things but this was the first effort in the smartphone world.I was startled by the lackof documentation that came with it and with the lack of help on the web site.when i complained with a one star review, the BLU people got back to me immediately and explained the world of smartphones to me.nicely.gently.professionally.they explained that I was buying a mechanism - ie the actual phone - and that most of what i was confused about or needed to learn about was the operating system (Android)and they said that i should go out to the internet and find many sites that would work me through the various questions.They were absolutely right.(OK,one thing that they could have done that would have helped me would have been a big first instruction that said""if you have questions about how to use this smartphone - go out to the internet and find the sites that would work me through android"").I'm now completely happy with the phone because it is just the mechanism to facilitate the use of android.android I'm not sure about -seems pretty good.as a mac user, i value ease of use.as a tech guy, i always want to find out how to do everything else.we'll see how that works out but it has nothing to do with the phone.the phone.i like the camera.the keyboard is pretty good.screen is big and clear.the dual unlocked sim works really well for the telestial sims i use for international.although, converting an old att pay as you go sim doesn't fit because it is larger than the micro sims that this requires.i suspect that this will be a small change to make.I don't have a lot to compare it to other than a flip phone and a macbook pro which i have relied on as my portables.but this seems like a very very good starter phone and maybe even a very good permanent phone for a non ""power"" user.everyone I knowhas something way more expensive and they don't have a single clue as to how to use it.",2016年9月9日 在美国审核

Update: Not worth it,"You get what you pay for. It's definitely worth what I paid, however it does have its downsides. Very little space, can be very slow and apps sometimes freeze. I don't regret my purchase but I can't wait to be able to afford a better phone.-----------------------------Update: My previous review was shortly after buying the phone. It seemed ok, if a bit laggy at times. Now, I can barely use it. After just one month I had to do a complete factory reset to get it functional again, and since then I've had to do it 2 more times. Now that doesn't even help. it lags to the point that it's basically broken. Apps constantly crash, I can't barely use twitter or google chrome even. God forbid you want to do something like netflix or pokemon go. On top of that, you can't download any apps barely. It comes with 8gbs of space but BLU filled it up with almost 4gbs between the OS and their bloatware. Definitely not buying a BLU phone again. If you're hardpressed for a phone, first advice is to get a flip phone and save up for a better smart phone. If you absolutely have to have a smart phone for some reason, and feel like wasting money then buy one of these.",2016年12月23日 在美国审核

After loading it with Music and Apps.I shipped it to Jamaica,After the tedious shipping process and times, my brother in-law finally received it but was told that it would not work on the cell network(s) in Jamaica.Before ordering the phone I read several reviews stating that the phone would work in Jamaica.Needless to say, it doesn't;t work but my Brother in-law has a great radio.Since it was shipped to Jamaica I am not able to return it for a refund......I have however ordered other BLU phones and they worked in Jamaica with no issues, not sure if I just got a Lemon.",2016年9月26日 在美国审核

Don't buy this phone.,"8GB Internal is completely used up by bloatware. No roots exist for phone so you can't force uninstall. This causes an annoying pop up every 5 minutes with a ""out of space"" text and notification. 4G is very spotty so don't rely on it. 3G as well. Camera says 8MP but doesn't look 8MP. Says micro sim too, it's actually a standard sim. It even states micro inside the phone. Battery life is short. Last OVA wiped your ""Blu help account"" (warranty bloatware) so now you have an alert saying you need to setup your phone. Doesn't give you an option to log back in. Says aluminum body, it's not. Body is cheap plastic that loosed fast. Buttons became stiff where you had to press so hard to get it to go down. Screen is so weak. Speakers are horrible. Says dual speakers, and yes, there are two, but one goes on and off so practically useless. Speakers sound distorted and blown out right out of the box.

There's almost no memory, no way to use added memory (that I purchased) since the apps seem to only want to install to the internal storage card and have limited transfer ability. The phone somehow is able to put my calls on hold and then call the same person I'm talking to or another person altogether. It hangs up / drops my calls almost every time I use it and crashes constantly. Camera is garbage and the main speaker I use to listen to calls through is distorted and quiet. I can't seem to use a microphone on a pair of headphones to talk and headphone output is ridiculously low also.

What a mistake!,"My 1st smartphone and not loving it.I've been using a dumb phone for the last 7-8 years.I'm not one of those who likes to yack it up from sunrise to sunrise.I use my phone when I need to make a call, to take pictures of what I need to buy and the calculator to do the math for me.Yes, it was a mistake switching to a smartphone.If I had known TracFone was going to phase out support for my old phone and send me a free smartphone, I wouldn't have purchased this one.What I hate:- battery life SUCKS!After a full charge, going thru the settings for a few minutes can drop the charge by 10%.Like I stated above, I use the phone only for necessity.I have disabled almost everything that has the name ""Google"" attached to it (Play, services, email, etc., etc.,), and it has not helped to extend the battery life.I've uninstalled the bloatware, disabled the clock, calendar, location services, data reporting, and none has helped.Even in sleep mode, the battery charge keeps dropping.For comparison, the free smartphone (LG Sunset) Tracfone sent doesn't have the same problem and I haven't even gone thru disabling all the apps I don't use yet.- customer support SUCKS!I can't connect the phone to my PC via USB.Contacted support via email and it took over a week to get a reply.I was told to look it up in the manual.The phone did NOT come with a manual.He should have known this since BLU's website doesn't even have a link to download the manual.I gave up after a few back and forth emails with support because it was going nowhere.I don't have the same problem with my old phone and the Sunset.So it's not my computer or the USB cable.- can't uninstall or permanently disable apps that came with Android.These apps take up space and memory and are of no use to me.I can do a force stop on the clock, calendar, download manager, email, etc, but they'll just come back up on there own.- it costs more to use with Tracfone BYOP minutes.What I like:- it's bigger than my old phone.",2016年5月29日 在美国审核

"I got greedy, my bad","$80 phone sounds great! Uh, wait a minute. They had to cut a few corners, but which ones? 1. Only 1 gig of memory. So when a system app turns on or you download a large website, other things have to be bumped out to make room. Like your Pandora playlist or something else you wanted started. They choose priorities, no options. 2. Not the biggest or most dense battery. What I used to consider a light day of usage, runs me to below 20% of battery by evening. Put it in your pocket. 3. Low cost components which means they are bigger than usual battery hogs. 4. Antennas are so-so so reception is so-so. 5. Using their texting app or a favorite, sometimes texts arrive hours late. If you open the texting app, they usually (usually) pop up, still hours late. 6. 8 gigs of storage, and I knew that going in. I got the important ones I need and planned that trade-off. Overall, it works, but it feels like I'm back to my very first smart phone, 15+ years ago.I definitely don't need the $600 phones. But it seems the $200 price point is about as low as companies can go and deliver a phone I won't have to worry about. I'll have to go back up to that.",2016年12月27日 在美国审核

Not good,So far...not so good.Bought this to run on ATT network after my LG G2 touch screen started to have some dead spots.Worked ok at first but memory is non-existent so I bought a 32 min SD card.Downloaded a few of my old apps and then started getting a low internal memory message...This shouldn't be an issue since I have it set to load everything onto the SD card!!!Even after manually moving my few apps onto the SD card in settings it still will not download any more apps stating that the internal memory is too low...More fun...the phone will occasionally reboot itself and then lose some of the apps that I downloaded onto it...Great idea in theory to have an unlocked phone but this one seems to be a glitchy piece of crap so far...,2016年7月15日 在美国审核

Decent phone for the price,"The phone is good. The biggest only problem though is that I made a mistake with this purchase which I, unfortunately, realized too late.I'm from Nigeria where the 3G frequency band of the telcos is different from that in the US. I bought the phone while on a trip to the US and did not know this until I got back to Nigeria and since then, I've had to find alternative means of getting internet service on the phone. The maximum speed which I can get from my SIM in the phone is 2G, which is too slow for anything.Apart from that problem which I won't blame the seller for, it's a decent phone for the price. The camera is not that great (especially in dimly-lit environments) and the phone is not that fast (you can't expect much of 1GB RAM after all). Also, the battery doesn't pack a lot of juice and you should not expect it to last you for an entire day outdoors, expect you let it sit in your pocket for most of the time. But I'd say it's decent for the price.",2017年6月23日 在美国审核

Don't wate your time or money if you want to use TRACFONE.,"I bought this since it was NEW and UNLOCKED. I also bought the TRACFONE SIM card KIT that was advertised along with it. After three attempts with two rude people from Tracfone, I finally got someone onn the telephone to activate this phone. It seems this BLU phone is incompatible with TRACFONE. All you can use it for is to make or receive calls or text messages. After doing exactly as the rep said in setting all the items (which made me wonder does everybody have to go through this when activating a cell phone), I learned you cannot use the internet nor access any web sites. I was asked to type in a web site so naturally I typed in www.amazon.com and nothing happened. So I gave up my original Tracfone and its number for this. I also ordered two phone cases (since the color I wanted would not show up in the cart) and a tempered glass cover. But what I have is a pretty picture phone that does nothing different than my first Tracfone.Apparently BLU phones are not compatible with TRACFONE.I am glad I found that out as I was ready to order the BLU HD R1 phone which is an upgraded model.",2016年7月20日 在美国审核

I came across this BLU phone with fairly good reviews. It came super quick,"My Samsung S5 took a swan dive off a treadmill so I had to get something else. My contract is not up until November. I came across this BLU phone with fairly good reviews. It came super quick, nice work Amazon.The phone itself is a good basic smart phone for $59. Its appropriate for someone who just needs a phone and will use some basic apps. The phone is nice and thin and I like the case. The touch screen is not that responsive as a Samsung or my work I-Phone 6s. But obviosuly its a fraction of the price. Its a little harder to type on then the bigger names. The other two things I notice is 1. its just slower (starting up, opening apps, scrolling, loading) again its a cheap price and fair enough. 2. The camera is not very good, especially in low light. I can live with these issues for a few months. I just needed a holdme over phone. It started up perfectly and accepted my AT&amp;T SIM card without issues. The interface for email, contact and text is a little different, but fine. Bluetooth and WiFi work well.If you love your phone and are on it constantly you might want something better.

Turns itself off and Reboots.The battery took 10 hours to charge. Then, it's only been off the charger for less than an hour, and only used for this review and and down 10%.The sound on this thing is horrible. Didn't even hear my alarm go off, so guess who woke up late?I wish I would've never gotten this phone. It would be amazing if they could fix the battery life, the internal storage, which was already half used by the time I got it, so really you only get 2 GB of data.I also went an purchased a case for it and screen protector.

But there are a little to be desired, first, it's very easy that battery cover gets dirty. You'd better order a new case together, but it's not many kinds. The other one is it's hard to remove the battery cover. It's not a big problem, because you need to remove it when you get this phone at first and you can charge your phone with battery after then. I'm sorry there is no battery case. Please don't forget this phone has 4GB internal memory! Already phone uses about 2GB memory when you get it.",2016年2月17日 在美国审核

This is great if you have kids that are always wanting to use your phone for whatever app they use and not have to worry about your friends and family receiving illegible text messages or those pics that were supposed to have been deleted.It does not have a HD screen - oh ya its $60It starts at 4gb and is closer to 1gb with all the apps included - yup its $60It doesn't have 5ghz wifi capability - how much was it? Yes, $60The cameras are 5mp back &amp; 2mp front - here is the shocker.... are you ready.... its $60!The fact is, the phone is actually really nice for the price range.

You Will Want To Blow Your Brains Out,"I am a person that has always bought the latest and greatest phones or close to it. So having to make due with this device has been challenging to say the least.I realize for $60 it's not going to be able to compare to the Galaxys and Pixels and iPhones - I'm not intending to flame Blu for making a pile of crap, because for the price it's not.But, if you're coming from anything above an iPhone 4, tread carefully.It has dual SIM ports, the screen is a decent size for this day and age at 5 inches, the battery is removable which is a big plus, and it does have a SD card slot. However, it doesn't support LTE. Doesn't support dual band WiFi. Processing is very slow. The cameras are not good. It's running an old version of Android (5.1). And biggest drawback of all is it has a measly 4 gigs of storage, .This severely handcuffs you if you need to have a multitude of apps.Moving your apps to the SD card helps, but as you might know, all apps need to leave some data on the internal storage, eating away at precious space.To put it in perspective, an old iPhone 5 will put this thing to shame.So all I'm basically saying is you should realize what you're getting.It's probably geared for the non-tech savvy or senior citizens or maybe as a backup lifeline for business people who can take advantage of the dual SIM.For me, it was a cheap replacement after breaking 3 phones in one month and having to pay them off before getting something more on the bleeding edge.If you are used to snappiness and never worrying about storage space, you've been warned.***EDIT***This phone is horrible.I don't know what I was thinking when I first wrote this review, but I take it all back.It's the slowest phone I've ever owned.In my previous review I said an iPhone 5 will run circles around this Blu - no, a GS3 from 2011 will!Please take my advice and keep looking.For $70 you can find such a better smartphone experience.",2017年4月26日 在美国审核

I don't like it that much but I only paid 60 bucks,"I really liked the design - judging from the look of it for sure people will think it is an expensive Samsung phone. Pretty and strong too, I dropped it a couple of time and it's still fine.I only hate it because due to the small RAM and internal memory, the phone is very laggy, and the worst is - even if Ibought a 32gb memory card, all of the apps I downloaded DO NOT save to my memory card, but to the internal memory. So I downloaded like around 15 functional apps and the phone doesn't let me download anymore, and I have to move each of them by hand to the memory card. What a bummer.Another cons,I'm only a beginner photographer, but I tell you, the camera is SO SH*TTY it hurts my eyes. Do you know how front-facing cameras on iPhone or samsung phones are super bad, like 1mp, 2mp? This thing's back camera looks just like that.Anyway, I got it for like 3 weeks because I lost my old phone after almost 2 years, then this morning I lost this phone too and I bet because it looks too pretty and expensive, people would want to steal it more.",2016年3月30日 在美国审核

BLU will not have you back. watch out for shady business practices,Battery died a 9 months.OK no big deal I replaced it myself. Then the Touch sensor died at 11 months. I reported the failure and they suggested a software work around which worked for two months then failed again. I called them and they said tough luck you are out of warranty at 13 months!Good Riddance this piece of crap was calling people all hours of the night and day without my permission anyway.

Absolutely do not buy this phone.,"I bought this phone as a replacement for another phone, the first phone broke, and we had a 2-year warranty, that we were completely unable to contact anyone about. Instead of getting the phone fixed or replaced, the money for the phone got refunded. We bought a new phone of the same exact type, it came in the mail. Immediately, I put the battery in, started charging the phone, turned it on, and it worked fine, for literally 2 minutes, when the screen suddenly went black, and I couldn't see anything on the screen. Within 5 minutes of getting it, I'm unable to use it. When I reboot the phone the screen is vibrant, but immediately after the startup screen it turns back. Absolutely, 100% the worst product I've ever bought.",2017年7月6日 在美国审核

The internal storage claim is a lie.,"I thought BLU phones were a cool way for Amazon to get their hands in the smartphone game until I bought one. The memory advertised is a lie. I bought a 4gb internal memory phone from them... it had 1.8gbs of memory. The os says 4.00gb, which is bs. Nothing has ever had exactly 4.00 gb, ever. I bought another one at 8gb of internal memory.. it came with 4.18gb, even though the os reads 8.00gb. I hAve changed about 5 people minds from purchasing because of that.
