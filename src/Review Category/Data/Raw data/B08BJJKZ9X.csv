Phone looks brand knew.,"I bought this phone for my son that lives in Jamaica as a Christmas gift.You see I was so nervous and skeptical to buy this phone. because of the mixed reviews.the phone came with a charger, the pin to pull out the SIM card draw, a receipt and a instruction card if you’re gonna send it back. The phone and everything mentioned was packed in a nice box.The phone is clean and looks brand new. no scratches or scrapes. it’s also unlocked which is what i payEd for. Everything on the phone seems to be working fine for now, I’ll update later if anything changes. So far I’m happy with my purchase. no complaints",2019年12月7日 在美国审核
Best smartphone made (not kidding),"I’ve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I’ve played with the X, and was disappointed.Pros:Battery life is superior to anything I’ve ownedReception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone.The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It’s flawless in your hands.It’s faster than any galaxy or iPhone I’ve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9)The apps are just designed better.I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever.3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I’ve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It’s constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does.The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality.You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it’s BS.Wireless charging is lightning fastSeamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!!The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it’s very loudThe new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. StunningCons:PriceyNo headphone jackAll glass (doesn’t bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on.No headphones includedNo cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it’s a non issue)The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality)Overall this truly is an incredible device.",2018年12月9日 在美国审核

Beautiful phone with amazing performance.,"6 Months Later update - Still acts like I bought it yesterday. Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)<br>First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.</br>",2019年12月20日 在美国审核
Review,"INTROI bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I’ve also had Androids and many different types of PC’s. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery.IDEAL USERThe ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations.CAMERAIn my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken.BATTERY LIFEThe battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two.OVERALLOverall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it’s the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won’t always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.",2019年2月15日 在美国审核

So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months.<br>Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews.I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone.EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all. I'm considering doing a return.</br>",2019年7月25日 在美国审核

Amazing and in Mint Condition!!,"Amazing deal!! The phone is in mint condition and everything works and looks like new. I purchased the fully unlocked (all carriers) renewed premium phone sold by Amazon. Renewed premium phones come with a year replacement or return on them plus a guarantee of at least 90% battery life. The regular renewed phones only have a 90 day return or replacement window and at least 80% battery life. My battery shows 93% which is excellent for a used phone. The phone is super fast when surfing the web or playing games and the camera is incredible. I love the facial recognition feature and the speakers sound amazing compared to my old iPhone. It was packaged with care in a nice box which also included pamphlets, a sim card key and a charger with cable. I am so happy I purchased this and highly recommend purchasing renewed premium.",2021年4月6日 在美国审核
"Buying ""Renewed by Amazon"" experience - The iPhone XS Max","So, I recently made the decision to move back to Apple from Android and was not going to spend the $1000 on a ""renewed"" device when functionality wise, the XS max and 11 Pro max are very close.With that, I chose to go down the Amazon renewed route rather than taking a chance on ebay simply due to the ability to very easily return the device if it does not live up to Amazon's renewed standards, never mind having a 90 day return window if something does not go as expected (remember, this is ""renewed"", not NEW so by this time, most bugs or hardware issues should be worked out and if not, you will know pretty quickly and be able to return/replace).<br>So there are two things I would recommend when buying a ""renewed"" device.First, just don't buy right off the main device page, but research the vendors that Amazon uses as all of them are not equal in quality or customer satisfaction.I learned this the hard way.Second, I will say that MOST of the devices you will receive, cosmetically will ""look"" brand new, which in my book passes the first test.I did have a device that looked good, but had internal hardware issues and I had to send to send it back. twice.(This goes back to the vendor research and their ratings).In all, the phone I received from CTS warehouse was nearly perfect both cosmetically and function wise AND I got a brand new third party charger &amp; cable (You really don't NEED Apple branded), which also works perfectly.So, before you press the buy button, do your homework on who the vendor is otherwise, Amazon's ""Renewed"" program is probably the best one out there for saving hundreds on a device that looks and functions like new rather than taking a chance on ebay.</br>",2020年10月18日 在美国审核
Satisfied!,"Ordered: Unlocked iPhone Xs Max Silver-(256GB)<br>I’ve seen a few one star reviews, so here’s a full honest review.The phone arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was light, but also secured. After un-wrapping the phone. I’ve noticed it had no front/back glass scratches or cracks. However, it did have hardly noticeable chips on the metal sides. The phone was also a little dirty around the edges and camera. (Which was easy to remove and back clean!) As promised the phone was unlocked with 256GB.</br>",2019年12月4日 在美国审核

was a bit hesitant buying renewed but this phone is beyond amazing!,"So I ordered this phone in early January, using it rn to type this! i've been using it for about 3+ weeks now. I was pretty hesitant buying from amazon renewed since i’ve never purchased their refurbished products before. Before this phone i had been using an iPhone 7 plus for about 3 years so this definitely was a huge change!packaging: i do want to add amazon said it would take about a week to come with amazon prime but it came about 2 days early, which was really good. This phone came nicely packaged with a box from the company. They also provided a charger (an off brand one but it worked just fine)i purchased the rose gold with 64gb. I did realize this was the lowest amount of storage but i was coming from 128gb that was way too much for me, so this was definitely the perfect amount, not too little at all.Just the overall look of this phone is really nice and aesthetically pleasing. I really love how the screen takes up the whole phone and just looks really sleek and nice. This phone came with no scratches from what i could tell and looked in perfect condition. Face Id is also a really nice feature that works so quickly compared to touch ID.overall the price isn’t the cheapest but it’s definitely worth it in the long run. In my opinion, this is one of the best iphones to date (even better than the 11) and if you’re hesitant to buy this phone i would say just go for it because it’s by far the best phone i’ve had (((:",2020年1月21日 在美国审核

Thank you for selling great products!!! A++++,"I was concerned at first buying a renewed product from Amazon, but I have to say that the entire experience has exceeded my expectations. Not only does Amazon back the product for 90 days but the seller (buyspry) provided a product that was pretty much brand new!!! BUYSPRYS customer service was excellent. I originally bought two iPhone xs that arrived in practically brand new condition. Battery health were at 85 and 90%. After a few hours of usage I decided I actually preferred the xs max. So I bought two more phones from BuySpry and return the xs. I was refunded quickly by the seller. I received my 2 iPhone xs max and wow wow wow. I thought the first two phones were brand new. The iPhone xs max I received were absolutely brand new and as the pictures show battery health on both phones are 100%. almost forgot, the seller includeds screen protectors on the phone upon arrival. I will never buy a new iPhone again. When a phone cost more than my mortgage payment it kinda ridiculous. Thank you buyspry for supplying a fair price and an amazing product!!

"Was not Like New, not in excellent condition","I have always purchased renewed cell phones and never had a problem, until this time. This phone was supposed to be like new, in excellent condition, with minimal signs of wear. I had taken it out of the box, and it had a filmy cover on the front and back. I thought That was awesome until I suddenly noticed something looked amiss under the protective cover. I lifted it back to find a chip in the bottom of the screen with the telltale spider crack going out in several directions. Trying to give the seller the benefit of the doubt I held it out at arm’s length. Definitely noticeable. And a huge problem for the longevity of the phone. Scratches and dings are one thing. A chip in the screen with connecting cracks? Come on, now! I just paid over $700 for this phone and don’t need to go pay for a screen replacement on top of that plus all of the time and stress to go with it.<br><br>I immediately initiated a return request, which was approved and surprise again! I get to pay the return shipping on a product that arrived damaged and was not in the condition the seller promised it would be in.And now I’m left wondering if they will try to assess a restocking fee even though the phone doesn’t look like new and is not in excellent condition.I’m pretty upset at this.</br></br>",2020年3月11日 在美国审核

Additionally there were no scratches and the software seems fast and responsive. IMPORTANT NOTE:I saw a lot of reviews saying that people didn’t know this phone was locked to AT&amp;T which it is. Read the description it clearly says it is an AT&amp;T locked phone. I knew this when I bought it but thought I’d make that clear for everyone. Additionally unlocking an iPhone from AT&amp;T is super simply just visit Att.com/deviceunlock it’s that simple.Also STRAIGHT TALK does I repeat does work on this phone without the need to unlock, as long as you have the AT&amp;T network compatible SIM card.

Loos like new and works like new,"Maybe I'm cheap or old fashioned (or just old), but spending $1100 on a new iPhone sounds like a waste of money. But buying a used cell phone can be a challenging experience. There are always the bad reviews left by people that didn't get what they wanted or thought they ordered. There is always the worry about ""What if there is a hidden problem later?"" that plagues your mind. With the Amazon 90 return policy, I decided to take the chance and order one and I also ordered the 3 year product warranty. This phone looks as good as new. It seems to be 100% functional so far as well. With a 3 year extended warranty, it is better than buying new from Apple because new Apple products only have a 1 year warranty and they charge more for their extended warranty than Amazon charged me. So I got a ""looks like new"" and ""works like new"" iPhone with a 3 year warranty for $350 less than new. Sounds like a good deal for me. I'll definitely explore more reconditioned tech items from Amazon in the future.",2020年12月10日 在美国审核

Face Recognition works so great, it recognizes so fast even in night time.

The battery life is at (as shown in image) 94% capacity, which is higher than their minimum of 80%. There were NO scratches, dents or any other damage anywhere on the phone. It came with a protective screen sticker (removed when putting on real protector and case), and an actual apple brand charger/cord.I upgraded from an iPhone 6s 16gb to the iPhone XS Max 256gb. The set up was extremely easy - my SIM card fit into the new phone and I was able to wirelessly transfer everything from my old phone as well through the prompted set up screens.The volume is WAY better than my old phone. Like, in a huge and substantial way. It's amazing. The screen is, obviously, bigger and the quality is definitely way superior. The phone is fast, connected to my bluetooth devices without any problems, and connected to my Mac automatically when I signed into my Apple ID.16gb on my old phone wasn't enough for apps and to keep up with current software updates - now I am able to complete updates without worrying I will have to delete things. As minuscule as it is, playing Pokemon go used to have issues with it's AR mode (which directly related to the phone and software updates not being performed) and now there's no issues at all.

"Perdi todo mi dinero, tengan cuidado.","NO COMPRARLES, TENGAN CUIDADO.Desde febrero hice la compra sobre este producto para finales de ese mes lo recibí, resulta que en ese paquete vino un Samsung Galaxy S7 Active con un cargador de iPhone, el paquete venia sellado con las etiquetas de Avianca aun como que no lo tocaron o abrieron, adjunto las imágenes (borre los datos por seguridad).Esta empresa dice que no vende Samsung, hace poco vi una publicación en su tienda que tenían varios Samsung. Al tener este problema inmediatamente me comunique con Amazon para ver que tocaba hacer, se hizo la apelación del reembolso perfecto lo aceptaron ellos y me mandaron las etiquetas para devolver el pedido, se habló por teléfono que mandar ese artículo era costoso y que igual iban a dar el reembolso de lo que gaste ya que era un gasto innecesario, seguí todos los pasos de Amazon, rápido mande el artículo, después ellos decían que no habían recibido nada, cuando el paquete lo firmo alguien de esa empresa misma persona que me contestaba correos, desde ahí se puede notar que no querían ser responsables por sus actos, ya verifique el paquete con el número del tracking y si llego a mi dirección, pero cómo es posible que le pongan $100 por si se pierde ese artículo, ni siquiera yo le puse que costaba eso a un teléfono de tan bajo valor.......si eso fue lo que recibí no sé cómo esperaban que yo mandara un XS Max si nunca lo tuve, algo ilógico por no decir otra palabra.... Solicite el IMEI del teléfono para rastrearlo y no me proporcionaron esa información, en qué momento le tiran la culpa a un cliente por comprar un producto, al final me decían que yo era el culpable de eso, o sea… En ningún momento dice “Reembolso total”, me ofrecieron un “Reembolso parcial” y no por lo que había comprado, sino por un feedback que les hice, les importaba más el review, claro así no se dan cuenta las demás personas de como son, yo sabía que al quitar ese feedback esa empresa iba a deshacerse de mi como si nada.Sean más responsables y los denunciare por redes sociales para que se den cuenta de cómo son.",2020年6月18日 在美国审核
Absolutely nothing wrong with it!,"Looks brand new and battery life is exceptional! I don’t use facial recognition but it does work perfectly. Apple still has a ways to go to achieve really top notch photos. I’ve been using a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 with its 16 megapixel camera and it is much farther along in all categories but the XS Max is usable for now. Apple needs to step up their sensor development to stay competitive. Everything else is nice to use. I still find it weird that the word intuitive is used to describe iOS software. I find Android to be more to my liking. But I switch every few years and Apple seemed fun to try again. Staying away from the Two-Factor trap, though. When you try to change to another platform it’s an exercise in frustration to get your phone number released. I had to register a whole new Apple ID. But very happy with the company and the actual phone.",2020年12月19日 在美国审核
It’s ok. Too expensive considering flaws.,"My biggest worry was that it wouldn’t work with US Cellular. But in three minutes they had popped in a new card and had added it to my line, no problem at all. I was surprised to see that it had 100% battery capacity. I couldn’t find a scratch or dent anywhere on it. It literally looks and performs like a brand new phone. I highly recommend buying from this seller. It may not be new but it definitely seems like it. With my budget I could either get a really good older iPhone or a basic cheap new(ish) one. I’m so glad I chose to buy refurbished.After having it a few months, I’m not quite as giddy. The flaws aren’t enough to make me regret having this phone; I just regret paying so much for it. This phone has two issues. 1) The lower volume button does not push in or pop out. It’s like it’s just there for looks. The increase volume button works fine. So I have to swipe down on the screen to lower the volume. Not ideal but it can be lived with. 2) Occasionally the playback is garbled on videos I record. There’s no rhyme or reason; sometimes the recorded sound just goes out. Playback is silent or muffled with electronic sounds at random times. The microphone and sound are great when I’m talking on it.I find it hard to believe these flaws were not noticed during the refurb. Then again, it took me a while to fully notice them. Again, I don’t mind that this is my phone. I’m ok with it. But it should have at least $100 less than what I paid.",2021年11月7日 在美国审核

I have been looking on every website and even face book market place, but felt better using Amazon since I can return if anything was wrong. I got the phone days before the anticipated date or arrival. The phone has no scratches, nothing is functionally wrong with the phone. Also came with a screen protector installed.

Much more than I expected,"Although a renewed item at an excellent price, this phone arrived in pristine condition. No sign of wear at all and not a mark on it. 95% Battery life. I had an issue with the blue tooth that I resolved by reseting the Network Settings. Amazon tech support was excellent but ended up handing me off to the seller when we couldn't seem to rectify the problem. The seller responded very quickly...but with a busier than usual volume message (we seem to get a lot those lately). I did the network reset on my own and let the seller know. They responded right away and said to contact them again if I have any other issues. Over all I'm very happy with both Amazon and the seller's responses. I absolutely love this phone. I thought it might be too big, but my old eyes really appreciate the larger screen.",2022年2月3日 在美国审核
Legitamate,"Got the max specked option. Came unlocked as mentioned, paired with boost mobile under a preexisting family plan. I ended up needing a new simcard to connect the iphone, costed little over $10 buying direct from the boost website. Activation, well you can look up how to do that. Otherwise working great and then some. Battery came in at 99% its original capacity, so if you're a perfectionist well so much for that. I'm fine with it, full charge lasts me a full day of use.After it was all said and done, (including sim and shipping, no activation fee) this costed little over $500 cheaper than if buying new directly (compared to black friday prices).

My main phone,"So far this has been my main phone for about two weeks since receiving it through the mail. It’s completely unlocked and affordable . The battery life is definitely decent 6-7 hours of heavy usage. The Oled screen is absolutely gorgeous and the blacks look beautiful.Pros &amp; ConsConsTwo camera setup - for me the camera is amazing from the older iPhone I had before but for some people the two camera setup could be outdated compared to the other iPhones on the market.It’s a 2018 IPhone!! So your by purchasing this phone you have to understand the chipset and form factor is already 3 years old.ProsSCREEN QUALITY- THE OLED LOOKS INCREDIBLE WHILE GAMING, WATCHING MOVIES &amp; simply web browsing.The processor is still packs plentyof power even if it’s the 2018 A12 Bionic chip. The phone is still snappy and still very fast.There’s really no cons to this phone and the shipper even put a glass protector on the phone for me. So I have zero complaints and in two months I’m purchasing another device from this shipper.Last thing! If your coming from a IPhone XR, 8plus, 7 plus then this price for under $330 for a IPhone XS Max unlocked and still getting updates until 2026 is definitely worth it!",2022年5月15日 在美国审核

IPHONE XS MAX wold from BUYSPRY- AMAZING CONDITION,"iPhone XS MAX 258gb Space Gray - Sold from BUYSPRYThis review is for anyone who is skeptical about buying a refurbished IPhone from amazon renewed- Chillax. Theses phones are GREAT.Specifically from the seller “BUYSPRY”Honestly so impressed with the quality I received the phone in. I looked and looked and looked and I can’t find a single scratch, dent, error anywhere. It appears whoever previously owned this device either returned it without even using it or didn’t even take it out of the box. The battery health is at an amazing 100% which I was not expecting at all. After being so skeptical about it for a week straight I finally decided to try it out and boy am I glad I did. I can’t reiterate enough how good the condition is.**Remember not all phones come from the same company that refurbishes them. Some companys have better reputations than others so make sure you check all of them and chose the one you feel the most comfortable with. Also remember- Higher price DOES NOT necessarily mean higher quality. Mine was $700 and it’s FLAWLESS**",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Perfect condition iPhone.,"The phone is immaculate. BuySPRY practically sold me a brand new iPhone. It has almost little to no scratches if looked at closely, and has absolutely no issues. I recommend the buyer. The only issue I have which isn’t much of a real problem at all is that the phone doesn’t come with headphones. I don’t have an iPhone headphone adapter so it’s annoying a bit. Otherwise the phone is great and the charger isn’t cheap, it works well. If you are skeptical about buying a renewed iPhone, just do your research on the sellers. Also my phone battery health is at 96% which is pretty good to me. It lasts all day until 3 am with normal use.After about 8 months of continuous FaceTime use the iPhone has problems functioning on facetime and crashes everything when it’s overheated and sometimes the brightness fails and doesn’t fix itself.",2020年5月20日 在美国审核
I’m Truly Amazed,"I have to say this phone is way beyond my expectations. When I was making the purchase I was looking at it said renewed model. My expectations were not completely high. I was thinking it will have some types of scratches or something to indicate some sort of use. This phone was way past like new when I got it. It looks like someone used it for a few hours or so and decided to send it back. THIS iPhone XS Max has no visual defects as far as I can see. The battery when I looked was 100% overall and in the description it says at least 80%. I was not expecting this phone to be so perfect. When I was setting up the phone and doing the face lock I was all smiles the whole time. I say and all honesty I am able to get over 24 hours of battery. The battery is overpowered. I will state I have Max at full brightness all day long and the battery is still good. I’m not a heavy user but if you are a casual user like me then this phone will get you through. I don’t know if you will get one from the same seller as I did, but if you have the chance I have the feeling you will get a good one. It feels so good in the hands. I was coming from a iPhone 7 and when I held Max it was like fate. I have big hands so this is perfect on all fronts. If you have big hands and you’re looking for a nice size phone then this phone will get it done.",2020年7月9日 在美国审核
"Apple Iphone XS Max, 512GB, Silver – Fully Unlocked (Renewed)","Apple Iphone XS Max, 512GB, Silver – Fully Unlocked (Renewed)<br>Sold by: Gryphon CommerceUsed IPhone are expensive so I always purchase them as Amazon fulfilled (which are rear these day) or amazon Renewed. That is my insurance policy against ripped off by 3rd party sellers.Battery health is at 90% which is not bad for a used phone. Condition of the phone is excellent. It has been a over a month now and is performing as expected (no identifiable defects).In the past few years, I have had to invest in used IPhones for my kids because American school kids have formed a “closed IPhone network”. If your kid does not have an IPhone, then they are left out of the Facetiming and group chats. Many of them do not even know of Android. The closest thing they know of an android is a Samsung.As a parent, all you can do is to ask you kid to suck it up and use his or her being avoided/left-out, to study. But life does not work like that for Gen Z. They are so sensitive to belonging at this age that you don’t want to add to their stress and depression by adding to their isolation from friends just because they can’t be reach by Facetime or the exclusive iPhone chat groups. So, as a concerned parent, and for the sanity of your child, you hit the used IPhone market for affordability while I myself continue to use a cheapo Android phone.Going through this process for 3 teenage kids, I have learned a few lessons.Thoroughly check the performance of every function immediately after you receive your phone. Your return window starts counting down the day it is delivered. I find TestM (Check Phone &amp; Report App) very useful. It will test every functionality on your IPhone. Start using your phone immediately so that if there is a defect that is unacceptable, you may catch it before it is too late.Although the price of IPhones are exorbitant, I have grown to appreciate their value. The first IPhone I purchased was in November, 2016, an Apple iPhone 6s Plus 128GB Unlocked(Certified Refurbished), Almost 5 years after it release, it has received all updates and is running the latest IOS 13. You don’t get such long support life from most android phones (except probably Google Pixel). It has gone through 3 screen replacement and it is still prodding on.</br>",2020年6月19日 在美国审核

"iPhone Xs Max, Space Grey GSM Unlocked","My Amazon Renewed (refurb) iPhone buying experience.I'll assume that anyone considering shelling out for an iPhone will have at least done some cursory research &amp; knows the actual features of the phone, so I'm just going to speak to the condition &amp; functionality of the specific phone that I received.First off, the unit arrived on time. I opened the box, removed the plastic &amp; closely examined the phone, repeatedly. For all intents, &amp; purposes, it was cosmetically a new phone. The only real, tangible sign of use is that the max battery life is at 91%. Touch screen, camera, calls, video &amp; music playback, all great (&amp; that speaker, coming form an iPhone 6 Plus... Wow!). Shiny new iPhone with a big fat phablet screen. I ordered it in April; it's now early July &amp; I've had no issues.

Perfect condition!,Came in mint condition. Practically new. Fully unlocked so I could just swap my StraightTalk SIM card over and use my old iPhone to transfer it easily. 256GB storage is amazing. Camera quality it’s out of this world. I love it! Only downside was the shipping time. It took a little bit longer than the typical Prime Free Two-Day shipping.

Mine was thrown in a padded envelope no box, no paperwork with a short little bad idea of a USB wire but that didn't bother me cause I had an old apple wire I use. I've done 2 software updates on it plus installed all my apps and it works perfectly. I would recommend this phone, it's great!",2021年5月4日 在美国审核
Better than I expected worth the risk.,"Is my first time buying a renewed IPhone since im upgrading from iPhone 7 plus to XS Max, I crossed my fingers to hope the phone actually work percectly, when I opened it is look almost like brand new phone like condition, I was surprised I thought is going be just a clean phone with fews scuffs etc it actually looks flawless when I recieved it, when I turned on it works pretty smooth no problems at all just start off fresh. Anyway I’m happy with my new phone I just purchased and it’s worth the risk to buy renewed iPhone from 3rd party seller, and also it came a day earlier.",2020年8月28日 在美国审核
Relieved and very happy about my purchase!,"I had to buy a new phone after my 6s finally decided to give out on me. I didn’t want to buy a new phone at full price, but was initially nervous about putting the money down on a refurbished phone that wasn’t directly sold by Apple.<br>It was a great decision! The shipping was fast and the package was well wrapped and protected. The phone looked practically new and came with a screen protector already installed. The battery was even charged when I turned it on, so that was a plus. Works exactly as it should, and I had no problem popping my SIM card in and using my cell service after restarting the device (I use straight talk) so the phone was truly unlocked.Overall a great experience, I got exactly what I paid for (color, size, gb) and I couldn’t be happier!</br>",2020年5月10日 在美国审核
A,"Best Experience for 2 reasons-1. ""I purchased through Amazon"" and 2.They are ""a Trusted Seller"". I have not had to call them, all was done online. Service has been GREAT!It was a big risk but seller did not disappoint. My Iphone XS Max, arrived sooner than expected, it very discretely and securely packaged, aesthetically pleasing, it was spotless and ready to go, fully charged and ready to go! It is beautiful and of great quality!!! I purchased the insurance plan but have not had to use it, but feel confident that with this seller and Amazon, if I ever run across a problem, they will not hesitate to fix it. Truly Grateful, unlike other sites, Amazon waited months before inviting me to review my phone purchase/experience, naturally allowing me time to use it, so I was looking forward to posting an honest review. Very Happy Customer! :)",2020年8月28日 在美国审核

I've tested every feature and all are working.The SIM from my iPhone 5c worked immediately when I powered it up and went through the setup, and I made my first call within three minutes of opening the box.I saved at least $450 in buying a renewed phone instead of a new one, yet I essentially have a new phone.I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",2019年12月3日 在美国审核

Fluently Smooth Speed &amp; Loving It!,"So far, everything with this phone, has been impeccable, and I haven’t had any technical difficulties at all. The only minor con that I would infer to is that it didn’t include any earphones for the iPhone XS Max; but that wasn’t anything I really worried about. I just purchased a Lightning Headphone Jack Adapter, so I could transfer other earphones with the device universally, so that’s what alternative I used to get around the missing headphones in the box. There also wasn’t a SIM eject tool either, but thankfully, I had one from my iPhone 6s Plus I bought. Nonetheless, the iPhone XS Max itself has been a very immaculate powerhouse, with the 512 GB internal storage, and the 4GB of RAM that has the phone operating at a unique speed. There may be some negative and dismal reviewers that didn’t like theirs, but don’t fret over their reviews; I’d say that it’s up to you to make that finalized decision for yourself.

I would definitely buy another phones in the future,I was very skeptical about ordering a iPhone from Amazon Renewed but I decided to do it. It was in almost perfect condition the only type of wear on it was around the speakers and charging port where you could see a case had been at one point. The screen was perfect without any scratches which really surprised me. The phone look almost brand new. The only think I wasn’t extremely happy about was how it was packaged. It was in a phone box with bubble wrap around the iPhone and that was the only type of protection it had. But rather than that it is a great product. The shipping was very fast I got it in 4 days. If your not for sure about buying it just do it. And even if it not in good condition you can return like my sister did because it wasn’t in very good condition and they sent her a new one and if I didn’t know better I would have said it was brand new.,2020年8月21日 在美国审核

They provide an appropriate charger, mine had a screen protector on as well. It was in great shape, no scratches that you could even notice (I took screen protector off to inspect better and put my own on). Keep in mind every phone is going to be different, it depends on the shape of the phone when they receive it and how to person turning it in took care of it.

The phone itself was in perfect condition on the outside. (Looks Brand new) but once I powered the device up it would intermittently shut itself off and it was frustrating. Once I got the phone to stay on long enough to set it up there was a warning saying it wasnt an apple original battery and it wouldnt work right. I am going to send it back in and request a refund because the phone didn't even function like its supposed to. Aesthetically it's perfect but it doesnt function correctly.

I love this iPhone and would recommend the seller to everyone!,"At first I was very skeptical of buying a refurbished iPhone because (1) I read a couple of negative reviews about the seller and (2) I've heard horror stories of customers buying a refurbished iPhone (from any seller) and couldn't use it. But I found a great price on the XS Max and decided to take the plunge and order it. Now I have no regrets of buying this iPhone! The phone is practically brand new.. it arrived in excellent condition, and it was easy to transfer my info from the 7 Plus to this. The only thing is the battery got really hot during the initial setup process. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. Otherwise, I love it! If you want to buy an iPhone at a reduced price, I highly recommend this seller.. you won't be disappointed!",2020年5月31日 在美国审核

Poor QC - Speaker Issues,"I knew that a used phone is ""used"" so I tempered my expectations but what I received was not worth the money spent.<br>The phone was acceptable in all exterior aspects except for a large section on the lower corner where it was obviously dropped against concrete or asphalt due to the pitting involved. The screen was good and without issue.The battery will last about 5-6hrs with moderate use and a check says it is at 85% capacity (still acceptable).The speakers were my major issue. This phone was water damaged, no doubt what so ever. The speakers were horribly muffled and the sound quality was atrocious. I was going to return but I spend 3 days playing music at full volume along with downloading a ""sonic"" app. After the 3rd day, the speakers are acceptable although nowhere near what they should be.Overall this purchase should have been $100 less than it was. This phone is not refurbished, it was cleared and boxed up after someone turned it in.Look elsewhere, this is not a good purchase.</br>",2021年1月31日 在美国审核

Poor policies - wasted my time,"The sticker on the back of this phone said it was not tested. It came to no surprise that this phone had a half green screen when I turned it on.Company tried to make ME pay for the return shipping of their defective product. I sorted it out with customer service (at first they implied that I should pay it because “it’s only like 6 or 7 dollars” - but agreed to reimburse me if I included receipt for shipping). It’s the principle!They wasted my time. They didn’t take the time to test their product and then cost me my time to call them, buy a new gift instead, go to the post office to mail (they don’t offer pre-paid labels), write my first Amazon review, etc...They should offer pre-paid labels, test their phones and not charge return shipping for defective products. I wouldn’t do business with a company like this ever again. Treat your customers better!!",2021年1月3日 在美国审核

Fully refurbished and looks like new!,"I was a bit nervous when I made the purchase but I read reviews and compare on the company's site to Amazon and what I found was they graded their products based on ware and tear. The higher the price on their site, the item was closer to practically new and the lower the price, they had some scuff so keep that in mind and compare both amazon and the supplier's site.The package was not in the amazon box as I originally thought and came with anon-apple charge base but I had my own. The phone looked practically new with no scuff marks so I was very pleased that for the price, I got such a nice phone. I am researching another for my spouse as well instead of going to Apple. You can find way more attractive prices with 3rd party vendors, just be sure to do your comparative research.",2020年3月7日 在美国审核
REFURBISHED Xs MAX A DEAL ?,"I reached out to seller prior to purchase and specified model for XsMax- global unlocked phone. Seller responded in time but could not guarantee a specific model yet promised global unlocked version. I took a chance on this expensive model and am happy. Build, battery life, aesthetics were like new , no visible damage . It came with screen protector pre-applied and off market charger- lightening cable. I waited for full month to post this review to see how it performed and likesaid I am happy so far. I can provide update if there is a issue in 90 days later. I will recommend and buy again from this seller.",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Great value,I bought this phone for my son and it arrived in pretty much perfect condition. He’s been using it for about a month without any issues at all. I was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone online but I’m so glad I did. The price was reasonable and I had every confidence that since this came from Amazon directly that I wouldn’t have any issues returning or exchanging it if I needed too. The OLED screen is my sons favorite feature and the reason he wanted this model specifically. I’m considering switching myself after seeing the difference lol. The battery arrived at 94% capacity which is exceptionally good for a refurbished phone. I would definitely recommend this option for anyone who doesn’t want to spend an arm and a leg on a brand new phone.,2021年7月5日 在美国审核
battery is dying fast,"It seems like there is something wrong with the battery! the first day I checked the battery life it was 98% so I was happy, a week later its 96%, 3 weeks passed it's on 90% of its health! I wonder what it would be after 2-3 months, 50%?",2020年2月16日 在美国审核
Buy without fear,"First of all, the seller has a full 90-day refund policy, so you don't need to worry that you will get stuck with a problem phone.Having said that, replacing and setting up a phone is a pain, which we had to do.My girlfriend and I each bought one.For mine, everything was great except that I could not get visual voice mail to work, despite numerous calls to Verizon and Apple customer support.Verizon told me that it is not a Verizon phone, so that may be the problem.Each time someone called or left a voicemail, I would receive a text message of gibberish.I would have to call *86 to hear if I got a message.I ended up giving the phone to my son since he doesn't use voicemail.My girlfriend's phone had no problem with visual voicemail -- also through Verizon -- but she had a different issue.Callers could not be understood on 3-way calls, which her family is doing a lot of right now to settle her father's estate.Ultimately, she exchanged it for the same phone from the seller.Also, you should note that the screens you get may not be original Apple, which I don't think is a problem.All the phones get shipped with a screen protector over them.The technician in the Verizon store peeled ours off so that we could inspect the screen.He said protectors can hide scratches.In our case, the screens looked fine when we held them up to the light.From a certain angle, we could see a tiny blemish with the phone off,but it was imperceptiblewhen using the phone.You may want to inspect your screen carefully when getting the phone.In the end, we got two renewed phones for less than one phone's price at Verizon.Buying this renewed phone is well worth any time it takes to return it if something is off.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核
Worth The Price For The Quality,"I always said “When my 6+ can’t make phone calls any longer, I’ll buy a new iPhone”.Well, I had the second battery swell in this model iPhone. It just pleads apart on the left side. This one is the second one from Apple to replace the original battery “belly”.This iPhone was received in spotless condition. It could have been packaged in the original box &amp; it would pass as brand new. Working great - have to get used to the no button arrangement.",2021年7月22日 在美国审核
Terrible phone,"What a mess it’s making of my personal info/sites, apps, texts, etc…Lost several good features I liked on the 7Plus.Supposed to have tons more storage, but now Apple is telling me I cancelled my storage (I didn’t) and wants me to RE subscribe for more stoeage cuz phone can’t back up anything. What happened to all this storage??Storage was the reason I bought the phone in the first place!!!I think I’m gonna return it…not worth the price",2021年6月11日 在美国审核
"Worked like new, looked like new (from the front)","I was pleasantly surprised at the phone's aesthetic condition; it looked nearly new even up close, with a few minor, hard to see scrapes or scuffs on the back (not on the screen or bezel). Works like new, all the accessories work like new, battery seems to work as well as a new XS Max's should, everything seems to be running well.Only thing I would ask the seller for is maybe a guide or a link to a guide on how to activating the phone (especially for items like this that are locked so certain carriers)? This was my first time using a locked phone and it took a surprising amount of frustration for me to just unlock it and restore it from an iCloud backup on a Mac. Not the seller's fault I didn't know that though, and there was nothing wrong with the phone whatsoever - it came exactly as well as advertised.All in all very pleased!",2020年8月26日 在美国审核

Pudo ser un Poco mejor...,"Compré este Xs Max un sábado y me llego un miércoles (eso que tenía prime), Luego llegó en una caja súper fea muy débil, mala presentación y eso que escogí al vendedor según su crítica “Kiss Electronics Inc” que parecía tener buenas críticas. Lo malo de su presentación es que el dispositivo llego con un temperd glass y estaba quebrado, me asusté tanto por que pensé que era la pantalla ya que es de esos temperd glass que cubren toda la pantalla y me costo distinguir del susto por lo quebrado, ya quitándole eltemperd glass quebrado, revise sus bordes y estaba impecables, luego la parte trasera tiene marcas por uso (extraas) pero no son visibles tan fácilmente hay que tocarlo para darse cuenta de esas marcas de eso, la pantalla tiene algunos rasguos por uso pero ya con un Temperd Glass del mismo que venía queda excelente, conforme a su autonomía vino con la condición de la batería al 96%, desbloqueado de fábrica, el cargador era genérico así como lo anunciaron pero no me importo ya que compré un cargador carga rápida aukey, la batería está excelente, la pantalla es OLED y es una maravilla, no ha sido abierto, pero he notado que subiendo los altavoces el sonido suele distorsionarse un poco, no se si es normal. Para el precio que me lo vendieron esta bien, esperaba algo un poco mejor pero cumple con lo prometido, tal vez una recomendación sobre la manera en la que lo empacan, ya que he comprado un iPhone X normal de otro vendedor y ese venía tan excelente hasta una regalía de un Cover y un glass, todo bien cuidado en una caja súper fuerte, pero en cambio esté más bien me dio miedo por qué hay una pequea probabilidad de que el producto lo lleguen a quebrar por un mal empaquetado.Si tengo algún problema actualizare..PDTA: el celular lo ocupare en Centroamérica",2020年3月14日 在美国审核
Great!!,"Was hesitant to try buying renewed, and even more so when it wasn’t Prime, but I purchased from NetworkStore and battery is 100%, no damage to the phone whatsoever, Face ID is flawless, and the display is perfect. It came with an offbrand lightning cable and wall charger, and no headphones, but that’s very minor at this point and they work just fine. Swapped SIM card and everything activated right away. Would recommend (especially with the 90 day guarantee)!",2020年7月27日 在美国审核
"Good for ""Renewed.""","It's perhaps been close to 2 months now since I've made this purchase. First off, my phone usage is not extensive, only limited to text, calls, uncomplicated photo-taking, YT and Streaming.Performance-wise this is not bad at all. Screen is clear, photos taken are crisp and true to the 24mpx, it's good even for distance and etc. Battery life is above average, better than my Samsung (sorry), if I do have to have an ongoing conference or streaming and internet use, I have to plug it in just for my own security. Roughly the battery life lasts 1.5 days without internet use.Pretty much meets my needs. But I need to mention that it has blacked out without warning 3x already, total power off,all of those times occurred while the phone was charging, strange that...Most importantly here! - this did not come w/ the original power charger cord (Apple product). It came w/ another brand and it is problematic, in fact I am fearful when I use it because in truth, it is not compatible. Maybe compatible in terms of the physical connections but it's like it's being 'rejected"" when it's already plugged in. I am using an ipad charger for my phone and it works.",2021年1月29日 在美国审核

GREAT VALUE FOR A GREAT PHONE,Battery health came at 100% which is very impressive for one of these refurbished products. Also the condition was Like New with a couple scratches on the screen. Adding a glass protector took away the look of any scratches on the screen so if you plan to add one the screen should look flawless. The back and edge of the phone look great. Everything’s worked really smooth so far and I’m happy with my purchase.,2021年3月22日 在美国审核
"Was cautious, but amazing purchase.","Due to all the negative comments and reviews i was hesitant to buy this refurbished and was worrisome the entire time it was on its way to my house. When it arrived it was sealed alright, not the best but wasnt losely packed in anyway. What i found was very suprising. Phone was reset correctly, in beautiful shape, no scratches on front or back, full functionality and 100% battery health. Yet it did have a few wear marks on the corners of the phone (not on the screen, the edges) it was 100% worth it and i wouldve prolly put those there in the first month anyway. This phone was in someones hand for a handful of weeks if that it looks like. If every phone comes in the condition i got mine in, id say this is a steal. If anything goes wrong i will update, but so far, 10/10.",2020年5月14日 在美国审核
"Arrives Like New, Cheaper Battery Parts…","So… The initial unboxing was very pleasing. Firm packaging and well put together.

The screen seemed to be original OLED and what seemed to be pristine original casing and parts but the battery. Shocked to find out the drop in battery life from what I believe to be a cheaper battery. No I don’t use fast chargers, I use original Apple charger cable and block to avoid the drop in overall battery life, but here we are. It’s where my prior phone’s daily battery life was at. It’s understandable to fix up with cheaper alternative parts but I would think Amazon would’ve gone higher quality parts.",2021年6月15日 在美国审核
Best phone that I have owned!,"Love this phone!Lots of memory, great price and easy to set up.It did not come with a SIM card but that took 5 minutes to correct.I would make this purchase again in a heartbeat! It came in the original box and all of the normal Apple stuff inside.",2020年1月29日 在美国审核
Great Deal,Wow! I was a bit Leary to buy a refurbished phone. And this seller had an 80% positive rate which I was also Leary of. I went ahead anyway due to amazons return policy for this phone. And wow! This phone looks like new. Not a smudge or scratch anywhere. I even had to peel plastic off the screen. Sure it was in an aftermarket box with an aftermarket charger but I use aftermarket chargers already anyway. This was a great deal. This phone is awesome!,2021年3月27日 在美国审核
iPhone XS Max review,I will say for buying two of these phones both were in excellent physical condition. Everything worked properly from the Amazon Premium renewed box. Bought mine in April of this year and they still work. I will be honest I wad expecting to be ripped off but I was surprised on how good of condition the phones were physically on the body and the screen. I would suggest the premium renewed version if you want the phone to be more flawless physically. All in all happy with my purchase.,2021年10月13日 在美国审核

Looks good,"So I got a long extended charger with my phone, which I thought was a plus, rather than the short original one. Until I put my new phone charge and it didn’t charge. Thanks for a BROKEN charger.As for the phone itself, seems like everything’s good. Last phone I bought from Amazon turned on and everything but once I put the SIM card in it still said no sim, no network. Took it to Verizon, the gave us a new SIM and still nothing. So I’m just waiting for my SIM card to come in to make sure everything works!",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Iphone review.,"Iphone came quick, had some issues. Can't really say it was a bad phone but can't say it was a good phone either.Well deserve 3 stars. Not bad. The iphone came perfect. Hardly any visible scratches or dings. The only draw back about the phone is the speakers from the bottom and ear piece appeared to be damaged. The sounded shot like a car speaker that went bad. Tried to clean it thinking it was dirty and nothing. The seller which is very professional gave me some options if I wanted a replacement or refund with expedite shipping but this refurbished phone is like a gamble, waiting for this device to ship out and a new device to come in would be about a week and half turn around. Customer service is top knotch. Please note that the iphones dont come with original charger or charge box nor ear buds/ may come which dont. Now the screen and other functionality where perfect as it came be. No glitches, cracks etc. No lagging nor dead pixels. The touch was very responsive.The screen felt oem and not after market. (After market screens tend to have a discoloration in the quality response and depth of color of the screen, the words are not as crisp and tend to have a amber affect look rather then the iphone bright white). Charging port is perfect and battery life was at 93 percent which is perfect almost new. Such a shame I had to return it but will do business is the future for other phones.",2020年10月26日 在美国审核
Pick your seller carefully,"So, to start off with, it's an iPhone Xs Max. If you're looking for a review of the phone itself, skip this one. I ordered and I was very worried seeing a lot of people posting reviews about the condition of the phone they received. I carefully selected my seller who had a 90% positive review status, and while paying about 20 bucks over the lowest price, received a phone in what can only be called excellent condition. I would not be surprised if you told me the previous owner bought it and didnt take it out of its box during the entire duration of his ownership. The battery health was measured by the phone at 95% and it has no problems lasting me all day, and the exterior is completely flawless. Not a scratch, not a scuff, nothing. I did however take off a point for presentation. I was greeted with a fairly beat up cardboard box, and a generic charger that was dirty and a NON MFI power brick (I had bought a fast charger from anker at the same time anyway, highly recommend). All in all though, I would rather the seller skimp on the stuff that's not necessary or easily dealt with, especially when they're giving you a phone of phenomenal quality at a price that competes strongly with refurbishers who put far less effort into renewing phones",2020年3月9日 在美国审核

Pretty reasonable referb,"The phone ended up coming a day earlier than expected which is always good. When opening the box the phone did come with a charging cable and adapter, but in my case the adapter that It came with was not a fast charging brick and did not work. Big woop I have my own so no biggie there. Upon closer inspection of the display there was some small bump like scratches on the top right of the screen and back of the device. Almost like the previous owner keep it without a case in their pocket with some hard objects like keys. I'll be honest It's not really that noticable unless you tilt it on a 85 degree angle. Now onto battery. They did promise no less than 80% and mine was at 83% which is kind of a bummer but not too bad especially considering how hard it is too find this old of a device with a perfect battery. The speakers are kind of weird. Like the earpiece when you listen to music it has kind of a high pitched scream that only a younger person would be able to hear. It's not bad but not as good of quality as my OEM bought iPhone XR. Overall for this price point I would get one if you want a newer iDevice with an OLED display if you don't want to shell out thousands of dollars for a new shiny phone.",2022年2月22日 在美国审核

Marginally acceptable.,"This refurbishedtelephone functions at the low level of acceptability. Almost everything about it is substandard from what I would expect. The Camera functionality is marginal. The screen quality is at the same level. The battery life is probably what should be expected from a refurbished product.The biggest problem encountered was the fact that when the phone was restored from the cloud, Apple apparently thought it was a foreign device from another market area. They kept locking me out. I tried to reach technical support for the Amazon seller and received the usual next week maybe answer. That situation is nothing short of maddening. I tried to work with Apple. Since I am a half technical guy I was able to fool around with it until I finally resolvedthe matter although I’m not sure how. Perhaps perseverance? But may God help people who don’t have the ability to deal with those kind of things. That because there is no technical support to speak of.It’d be said that the level of customer service from Amazon shellers is generally awful. I’ve made this point in several reviews. It is ironic because a big portion of Amazon’s success has to do with their service but they don’t expect their sellers to come even close.And if you’ve ever heard the runaround try to talk to Amazon customer service about their sellers. You will get a lot of niceties and no help.",2022年5月10日 在美国审核
An ALMOST Like-New Experience,"To summarize, here’s my experience buying this product:The packaging is solid and the box came with a charger and sim ejector.The phone’s condition was decent, not perfect but good. There were a few micro-scratches on the back and slightly deep annoying little scratch on the notch, and it is also worth noting that the speaker grill was dirty upon arrival, but nothing else cosmetically. In terms of the condition of the battery, the phone displayed a battery health oh 86% capacity with isn’t bad.The phone functioned completely as expected, like a new phone. All the features work fine and it seems to perform like any other phone of its kind would.Overall: I’d recommend it. There is good value in buying this phone refurbished, and I believe it is worth the money. I’m a bit upset about the previously mentioned notch scratch and 86% battery health, but overall, it is still a great deal if you have weak phone and are in need of an upgrade.",2022年2月10日 在美国审核

Good coming from the 6S,"This Iphone XS Max works as intended, really easy to setup if you are coming from a older gen version.Everything on mine works well, and overall cosmetics are in perfect condition. Looks like the previous owner had a case on and installed (still on) screen protector.At first glance the battery life indicated 100% health, after a day of usage it dropped to about 92%. Not a big deal, its a used phone, if it need be you can always replace the battery if you want. Coming from the 6S the XS outperforms by a long shot. I get about 8 hours of mixed screen time per charge, which should last you throughout the day with one charge. I thought I would miss Touch ID/fingerprint but the FaceID works very well. And the lack of AUX port is unfortunate but I come to realize bluetooth technology sounds a lot better than the ones years ago.The thing is you might get one with blemishes or different battery life, it all depends on the seller so make sure to check their description. Otherwise this is a good phone, I just wished my refurbished unit had a new battery,",2020年2月14日 在美国审核

FAULTY Dot Projector,"All in all the phone was a very good value and at the price it was I was super sketched, but I bought it and I've used it for a few hours. The Amazon ad said it was renewed and in near new working order, HOWEVER, the Dot Projector is broken and therefore Face ID and portrait mode with the front camera will not work and there is a 1% chance of it being repaired. I have been a loyal Amazon shopper and a loyal Apple consumer, I feel this listing was falsely advertised, as the phone was described as ""Professionally inspected and tested to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by an Amazon-qualified supplier, who is not Apple certified."" It also said the supplier performs a full diagnostic test, replaces any defective parts, and throughly cleans the product. A broken Dot Projector tells me this product was either NOT fully tested, as whoever tested it would've also found out that since the Dot Projector is broken, the portrait mode on the front camera does not work, OR it was tested and knowingly sold with a broken Dot Projector. I normally don't even write reviews, however I feel people deserve to know that the attractive price of this phone comes at the sacrifice of Face ID and Portrait Mode with the front camera.

Pretty disappointed for almost $600 (in depth review),"(I am a tech reviewer, so I notice a lot more than an average person would) Upon receiving the phone I noticed a major red flag when one of the pentalope screws on the bottom of the phone was hanging out because it wasn’t screwed all the way in and the screen was raised slightly and sticking out of the body of the phone. It was at that moment that my heart dropped as I wondered of all things that they could have changed out for cheaper parts. Not only is the screen, not oem, but the battery isn’t either. This phone was supposed to come with an OLED screen which is one of the main reasons I bought this phone over the xr or iPhone 11, but it’s obvious that this screen is just a cheap lcd panel. 3D Touch is useless, and it’s not very bright compared to the oem panel. Moving to the battery, it’s decent right now as it is a new battery, but I’m scared for long term reliability of it, because I haven’t had a very good experience with aftermarket phone batteries. Besides all of those things, the phone works pretty good for a 2 year old device, and I wouldn’t have an issue if I paid maybe 400-450 for this phone but when I’m paying Almost the same price as a brand new one, I expected higher quality or at least oem quality parts :(",2020年11月16日 在美国审核

Renewed phone looks brand-new.,"For a 2-year old phone, this was a pretty nice phone. The only scratches on it were very faint and you had to angle it under a light to really notice them. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because I noticed that the ear speaker and the speakers on the bottom of the phone seemed to be a little dusty. Yes this is what happens when you buy a used phone and it didn't really bother me, but just thought I'd point it out. The last reason for the 4 stars was because the speakers on the bottom of the bottom seemed to be blown or partially blown. They just sounded pretty raspy and I compared it to a friends phone, which is the same exact phone, and it was very clear that this phone's speakers were a little blown. You really only noticed it when it was above half volume. To me this is something that should've been fixed. To most people though, it probably isn't super noticeable though.",2021年1月15日 在美国审核

Phone is damaged,"The phone I received did not match the product description on the page.The screen is damaged. The product description says the phone will be in ""excellent condition"" with no damage visible from 12"". The damage on the screen is visible from more than 12"". The gouge is very deep.I didn't turn the phone on before starting the return because the gouge in the front screen would be too aggravating for me to want to keep the phone anyway. It would be very distracting, and I wonder if it would impact the phone's ability to produce an image under the gouge.The phone arrived with a tempered glass screen protector on the screen, over the screen the damage. This felt a little underhanded to me.The glass back also looked to be a replacement non-OEM part. That wouldn't be a problem, necessarily, except it looks cheap and blocky.I initiated a return and will purchase another phone.",2022年6月19日 在美国审核

Would Recommend,Got mine in two days (Faster than I expected). Phone was in really good condition minus a couple tiny scuffs on the edge. Battery capacity was at 91% which is good considering they have a minimum of 80% to sell. Received mine through Verizon Pre-Owned. It also comes with a SIM tray remover if anyone was curious.

But while checking out this great like new iphone (according to Amazon) there is a one inch smear on the lower right corner which looked like a finger print, but it's deeper than the top glass there's seem to be some sort of mark underneath the screen which cannot be wiped away. Darn I thought I'd finally the perfect phone, I guess I have to return it. The vendor is Kiss Electronics don't know how they're involved in the distribution of these phones but the phone was delivered by fedex and the company also has a good rating they seem to be an OK store, but I'm not going to pay $630 for a cell phone with a potential bad screen on it....

Worked fine for 5 months then the battery exploded.,"When I bought this phone I knew it would have some defects because it was ""restored"". The battery significantly decreased in max capacity over the last 5 months from 86% to 62% and I had an average screen time of 3 hours and 48 minutes a day. This morning a random Green Line appeared on my screen and I had no idea where it came from. Then just this afternoon whilst I was taking an nap after work I heard a loud pop and found that my phone had expanded several inches out of the OtterBox case. My battery was like a swollen ice pack BUT the touch screen still worked! So I called Apple support who told me to immediately hang up and shut off the phone as it was liable to explode, due to gases being released inside the lithium battery. So fair warning to any who purchase a restored phone. Chances are the battery isn't in great shape and you should probably at least get the battery replaced when you buy it. I had noticed my max charge decreasing and kept putting it off. Now me and my OtterBox case wish I had. ALSO IF YOU SEE A GREEN LINE ON YOUR SCREEN IT COULD BE YOUR BATTERY STARTING TO EXPAND WITH GAS AND PRESSING UP AGAINST THE SCREEN.",2022年6月24日 在美国审核

Oh and because of issues with delivery on this item and another at the same time I talked to Amazon about the condition and they didn't seem to care.----I incorrectly assumed that the ""like new"" premium renewed experience would lend itself to being purchased as a gift, I was wrong. The protective plastic was improperly applied and was crinkled and bubbled and looked like this was a return. The box was crushed and torn.In short, it didn't look, ""like new"".My fault in trusting Amazon.

Nothing that alters the function of the phone, and still great condition for being used, but slightly bothersome.-Battery health is 90%-The seller I bought from (BuySpry) was kind enough to include a screen protector. That being said it came installed slightly crooked. Again, not a big deal at all, just thought I would mention it.

"front facing speaker is nearly inaudible, cant use for actual phone calls","this is the 2nd iPhone XS Max that i have purchased and they both have more or less dead front facing speakers, you know, the speaker you put up to your ear to actually use the phone... that is what this is. a phone. and because of this you are always required to either use a headset or speaker phone which uses the bottom speaker, not the one on the front of the phone.how in the world are these being tested ?music doesn't play out if it either, not in any type of audible manor.so.. what should I, as the buyer do? pay Mac to repair it when the seller claims that these units are fully functional and yet it very clear all they are doing is rudimentary tests on them ?no, i will not pay to have it repaired, i paid over $500 for a fully working 3yr old phone...and that is exactly what i expect to have.this is the only iphone model i have ever had that has dead front facing speaker issues, and there is ALOT of articles about it online, and their attempts to fix it in the article are all b.s. nothing but kindergarten troubleshooting that have never resolved anyones issue.its no wonder there are so many of these as used on the market.Also the battery is only rated at 88% battery life, how is this acceptable?",2021年3月6日 在美国审核

Junk.,"I purchased a ""refurbished"" iPhone XS Max. Physically the phone was in almost perfect condition, internally was another story.Phone would reset every 30 seconds while powered on, not even giving me the chance to be able to set it up. Extremely slow and wouldn't charge. I couldn't even keep it powered on long enough to connect it to iTunes to do a full system restore(troubleshooting method)Overall, extremely disappointed. I've read other reviews and was surprised that so many others have came across a plethora of issues as well.Amazon, you need to remove your ""Amazon Refurbished"" backing from this seller. It's pretty obvious that they are peddling junk. Honestly, you should remove them from this platform all together.",2021年6月2日 在美国审核
Almost a good deal.,"I received my re-conditioned iPhone 10sMax in four days. My first impression was mixed but excited.There are three significant scratches on the sides of the phone that go through the color that weren’t noted in the description. This wouldn’t have stopped me from buying it but weren’t a welcome surprise when I opened it up.The next but more significant problem occurred two weeks later when I had been using the phone for a week after switching out my older model. The earpiece speaker is completely inoperable in stereo listening mode for music and faint for hearing calls make on the phone. I hadn’t noticed earlier as I usually use a connected headset to make calls. What’s very disappointing is the sellers response which amounted to: return it for a refund or we’ll pay $30 towards repairs.Let’s be clear, I understand it’s reconditioned so I didn’t complain to the seller about the scratches on the body, I do however think a disclosure of them is in order for a $700 used device. Additionally, I believe the term re-conditioned means working as new and tested for proper operation. Very dissatisfied with the response from the seller.",2020年1月26日 在美国审核

Disappointing - it feels like I was harmed by an old friend,"Purchasing a renewed cell phone involves 4 critical (and inseparable) buying decision components. Each component is as important as the hardware itself, and all 4 components make-up the Buyer’s final buying decision and subsequent purchase experience:1) The Hardware2) The Warranty and Related Seller Assurances3) The Customer Service (pre &amp; post purchase)4) Overall value of the purchaseUnlike a new, factory-fresh telephone; a renewed telephone has a greater risk of failure, long-term usability issues and cosmetic imperfections. The obvious reason for this is a phone’s unknown history of use, maintenance/care, and ultimate reconditioning processes.The following will describe, in as much objective detail as is possible, my recent purchase of an iPhone XS Max from the Amazon Renewed Premium program. I will briefly describe myself, as an Amazon Buyer, to add helpful contextBUYERTo date, I have made 697 purchases with Amazon across 3 accounts in the US, Mexico and UK. My return ratio is 2.3%. Purchases mainly include high-end electronics (computers, phones, printers, networking gear, headphones, etc.) and unique household items. I am a Prime member who maintains and gifts book related subscriptions, and regularly gift Amazon Echo devices to family members. In short, our household(s) use Amazon frequently and Amazon has become “a family friend” that we have learned to rely on.1 - Hardwarehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BFMH5GZ?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details . iPhone XS Max – The Apple flagship of late 2018The packaging was a 9”x 5” x2” white Amazon box with the phone and a charging cable. The white box was placed in 12’ x 10’ x 5” with 3 small bubbles. The white box “rattled around” in the outer packaging.The exterior of the phone was clean and scratch-free. The screen was protected with a sheet of soft plastic.Battery Health = 88%. Unlocked = Fully. iOS received = 14. iOS updated to 15.5.The configuration of the phone was a “quirky” and the screen flickered from time-to-time. Because of this, I called Apple Support (I have an account) to help evaluate the phone and assist with the configuration and pairing to my existing Apple accounts. The TSR connected with the iPhone XS Max and diagnosed that there were issues with the display module and (possibly) the antenna. The inability of the phone to recognize most nearby Bluetooth devices was thought to be the caused by the antenna issue. The Apple TSR suggested I return the phone. At this point, I had the phone for approximately 6 hours.Disappointed (I needed the phone and had already purchased another $65 of accessories), I agreed with the Apple TSR and she helped me annotate the precise reasons for her diagnosis. My next step was to contact Amazon, for the promised Premium Support, to describe the issues.2 - Warranty and Related Seller AssurancesI contacted the main Amazon Prime number and described the issues (At this point, I was in possession of the phone for less than 20 hours). I was transferred to another department that handled Amazon Renewed Premium matters.Rep 1 – after describing the issues to the Rep and the Apple diagnosis, the Rep agreed with the Apple TSR and suggested I return the phone. I opted to have the purchase price refunded to me (to have some time to consider my next purchase options and availability). The Amazon Renewed Premium Rep told me it could take up to 180 days for a refund! I asked to speak with a Supervisor.Supervisor – agreed the phone should be returned and stated that the return policy allowed up to 180 days but said that 25 days after they received the unit was more normal. She also stated that I had to pay for the shipping from Mexico back to the US (which has not been not normal for amazon.com returns from Mexico since 2015). Is this a new “standard return policy”? Why was it not clearly described on the website, they knew where it was going?I paid extra for the Amazon Renewed Premium phone and the assurances that I would be fully satisfied. When I made the purchase, that assurance gave me a “warm fuzzy feeling” and the confidence to complete the purchase of the phone.3 - Customer Service (pre &amp; post purchase)Pre-Purchase: Went smoothly. I read all of the materials, decided on the higher costs Amazon Renewed Premium version and paid for it. The order was placed on 11 May and it was received at my home in Cuernavaca, Mexico on 15 May. I paid USD 525.70 ($429.00 – phone, $8.24 – shipping &amp; handling and $88.46 for the import fees deposit). Please note the cost of shipping.Post-Purchase: Not a good experience. Details can be provided, upon request. To make a long story short, the refund and return process was an unexpected shock. The hardware/phone is defective and I promptly reported it. There was no reason for the sub-par treatment of the return. I offered to pay for the return but asked Amazon to arrange it through their low-cost contract rates – they refused. My cost for the return (via DHL) would be USD 95.35 and a 3-hour round trip drive to the nearest DHL office. Since 2015, I have not been asked to pay for the return of a defective device. Even DHL (the contract RMA carrier for Amazon) was surprised that I had to pay, and they handle Amazon returns every day.4 – Overall Value of the iPhone PurchaseI securely packed the iPhone XS Max to assure it would arrive safely, and sent it via DHL at a cost of USD 95.35. That now brings the cost of this phone to $621.05.Despite the claims that Amazon will reimburse me for shipping, I have been told by an Amazon Prime Rep that I can expect to be reimbursed no more than $20 for the return. If true, I will take at least a $73.35 loss on this purchase.I will not purchase another phone until I have received the full refund for this one. That means I will be without a phone for up to 180 days.Buying a renewed phone has not been the experience I was hoping for. The hardware was defective and the warranty/assurances/services I believed I was getting when buying from Amazon Renewed Premium did not materialize.Summary Rating1 Star – Hardware (iPhone XS Max) – defective1 Star – Warranty and Relate Seller Assurances1 Star – Customer Service1 Star – Overall ValueAgain, when buying a renewed product, it is impossible to detach the actual product (hardware) from the other components of the purchase. It is simply the nature of selling and buying renewed products.",2022年5月23日 在美国审核

I then called customer support, and he was talking crap. I am amazed how he ended working for amazon. I have been without my phone for 2 weeks. I got the same phone and that was defective too, i had to return that. for the same phone they have been sending me craps. Man, you shouldnot worry about money. TIME is what matters most.

It is basically buying an used phone without looking at it first,I bought the renewed one because I think new iPhone is way overpriced. I bought it last year but forgot to submit the review. My purchase was a bit of disappointment. It didn’t come with genuine Apple charger. Phone shows scratch marks all around bezel. Luckily screen is OK because there is a screen protector. But the protector was put on slanted so it is an eye sore itself. But this was not seller's fault I suppose. So far the phone itself functions OK and hopefully it will last a while.,2019年11月27日 在美国审核

Scammed,Ordered the phone and it worked like brand new. I was so happy. Within the first week it crashed on me and it would not turn on. I did a special reset on it but the phone kept crashing over and over again. I went to return it through UPS so I could get a replacement. I even let the seller know I returned the original. They told me it was up to Amazon to send out the replacement. The replacement never came and now Amazon is saying it was all up to the seller to send it and Amazon told me that the seller didn’t know if I had returned the original even though I sent the seller a screenshot of my UPS receipt detailing my original phone’s return. Somehow the seller cancelled my replacement phone and didn’t tell me anything about it but they were happy to take my $421 except I have nothing to show for it. This is insane.,2022年5月7日 在美国审核
A little sketchy,"The iPhone I got 100% does not possess a genuine Apple screen. The colors don’t look right, the bezel around the screen is noticeable bigger than genuine screens I have compared it to and to top it off the screen isn’t even installed correctly. When I push on the bottom left corner of the screen it makes an audible snapping sound and you can physically feel it move deeper into the phone. Force touch barely works if you could even say it works at all. The battery life is horrific, it is currently 1:25 pm my time, I took the phone off the charger at 7:00 am and the phone is on 40% with light usage. The only reason I am not sending this phone back is because I cannot afford to be without a phone. I would not trust buying a phone from an Amazon dealer again.",2021年9月9日 在美国审核

Works great but screen installed incorrectly resulting in crack writhing one week,"This item is as described correctly in many ways, the battery, facial recognition and other features work as new. Unfortunately with my purchase it seemed that it was not the original screen, this is not a problem except the replacement screen appears to be installed incorrectly causing it to stick out further than it normally would. There is a small gap that you could put your fingernail in and ant certain angles you can see the phone light on the inside. This is not what I would expect even if the phone is refurbished the installation should still be done properly. The screen is secure but it is not level, causing one side to stick out further than the other even if it is just millimeters, the reason I bring this up is because even with a case there is already a very small crack in the screen right on the end(where the screen sticks out the most). I am not sure if this problem is standard or just the item that I received but a crack in the screen in less than a week of owning it is a problem when I haven not dropped or mistreated the device at all. The other features work great but because of the screen I can not recommend this product.",2020年12月8日 在美国审核

The phone I was sold was blacklisted back in 2019.,"Thought this renewed phone would be perfect for my preteen daughter. I check it out when it arrived, and everything seemed to be in working condition. I bought it in November, to give to her for Christmas. Long story short… due to me having to be out of town a lot for work, I didn’t get service hooked up to it until February. After activating it, it was suspended by my carrier. When I called to find out what the issue was, I found out the phone was reported stolen and blacklisted back in 2019. And since I’m past the 90 days (by a week or two), I’m out over $400.

Damaged Speakers on phone. Distortion sound even when phone is asleep,"Can not believe that they sent out a damaged device out to me knowing how much money I spent on it. Everything seemed to be okay until I went to play something to check speakers on phone, it started making this awful distortion sound. Over and over everytime I tried to play anything...even when typing on the keyboard the awful sound kept coming up.There was no way of lowering the volume on the phone so it wouldn't be as loud, and even when I would push the side button to put the phone on sleep mode/closing all apps, the sound was still there. I am so disappointed with this purchase, and can't believe they are stating on description that it's in great working conditions. I contacted the company and they asked if I wanted a refund or a replacement, I went ahead and told them to send a replacement to give them another try. It's been about a week now and I have not received anything or heard anything either. I emailed them and they gave me a very board answer that it's in transit...not sure if it's the damaged one I sent them or the replacement they are sending me. Will keep you guys posted.",2020年4月15日 在美国审核

Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max.It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.<br>Battery:The battery isexcellent and here’s why.Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn’t find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened.This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that’s different from Samsung, it’s better.I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy.I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter.With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day.The iPhone, also doesn’t burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it’s battery consumption is high.Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store.No such issue with the XS Max.I also don’t lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass.Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger.The sound is rich and full bodied and I don’t mind listening to music on the phone.Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new.That’s over 3000 songs if anyone is counting.The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one.I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I’m still learning iTunes.Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy.I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car.Siri: Where have you been all my life?Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy’s S Voice.I don’t have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked.This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all.Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again.The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in.All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization.There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones.Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness.Speed.The iPhone is Faster period.My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that’s significantly faster especially when you’re in line at the drive thru!!!Maybe that’s not a fair comparison but it’s reality.Screen Resolution: Here theGalaxy has the win, hands down.The iPhone is close but it just can’t compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution.It’s not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far.That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy.Camera:I don’t take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area.Jury still out on this one.Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here.At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy.Look and Feel:iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues.Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive.Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand.I am just glad I don’t have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response.Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar.TieHeadphonejack: None on iPhone and who cares really?What you don’t own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already?But you’re spending how much on this phone???Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you’re in the dark ages.As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot.Can’t believe I waited this long to switch.There was a time when I loved the Galaxybut that was when I first bought it.</br>",2018年12月4日 在美国审核
THIS ISNT A SCAM!,"I was super skeptical at first, I thought I was going to have to return it. But this phone came in 2 days, at about noon. This phone is literally. brand. new. (sort of) I know it’s refurbished but you could absolutely not tell that this phone has ever been used. Brand new quality, came in an actual apple box with an actual apple charger (no headphones but whatever) and for this price this is great. I saved over 100$ I was going to drop on a new one. I’m very very impressed.",2019年6月28日 在美国审核
An excellent renewed Iphone !,"I waited 9 months to evaluate this Iphone. I had my nephew who is a senior student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Engineering to inspect it and he found that the physical status of the Iphone can be compared to a brand new one. The functionality is flawless. The item comes with a 20 point inspection by an Amazon Tech who checks it for wifi connectivity, cameras, accelometer, etc whic is dated and signed by the technician. The battery health is 90% and all previous data was removed. I recommend an Amazon Prime renewed Iphone without reservaton.",2022年2月16日 在美国审核

Reliable!,"I was hesitant to buy a refurbished/renewed phone from Amazon but I am glad that I did. I had recently bought myself an iPhone 11 but switched to an XS Max because it felt nicer in my hand (my friend has one) and was a lot cheaper. It arrived a week earlier, and it came in a Verizon pre-owned box! Knowing that it came from Verizon eased the doubts I had about purchasing the phone, but when it came I felt much better. The box (the part you plug into the wall) was from Apple and possibly the cord as well. From what I understand, there are different sellers so review each of them &amp; read the comments :) The battery life was 91% and everything worked!",2020年12月29日 在美国审核

Pleasantly surprised,"I got this phone as a gift from my best friend and I love it! I’ve had it about a week now so I wanted to make a review. Some of the reviews had me worried I’d get a bad phone but I didn’t. The battery is at 89% capacity but that’s fine everything else is perfect. It has the original oled screen (I tested it) and I looked all over the phone no scratches, no nothing it’s like new.",2020年12月25日 在美国审核

Not worth it!,"I have had this phone for almost a year, and for the past couple of months, (I would say about 4 months) my phone keeps freezing on random apps, glitching, and restarting by itself. I’m starting to question if this is an authentic iPhone as it didn’t come in its original packaging. Either way I would say spend a couple of more 100 dollars and buy yourself a real iPhone from Apple, because it’s not worth it in the long run. I’m requesting a refund right now, so we’ll see.",2020年6月10日 在美国审核

Was great for about a year…,"This phone worked for about a year, then the main board crashed. The Apple store said it was trash. For over $600, I expected the phone to last at least 2 years, hopefully more. I’m sure it has something to do with it being refurbished, but I guess we will never know. Other iPhones in our home last 4-5 years or more.",2021年8月22日 在美国审核
Dont buy from synergy,"Ordered from synergy and got the phone in a decent amount of time. When I got the phone and turned it on it was all good until I started typing my info using the keypad. The keys were not working correctly. I had to type in my wifi password and email. I couldn't do so because the t key was stuck or was working. I kept pressing it and holding down on the t key and it just wouldn't work. And when pressing on other keys it would activate keys that I had touched. For instance, I touched the r key and it would activate the keys around it. And the swipe-up action and slide action on the iPhone was not very responsive. It's as if they fixed the phone and then decided not to test it and just ship it. I don't understand why these companies, specifically the ones that sell refurbished phones cant test the phone (which takes like 2 minutes) to see if it works before shipping it and wasting not only my time but their time also. It's just embarrassing and shouldnt be occurring in 2021. If it was the early 2000s it would be understandable but its not.",2021年9月22日 在美国审核

Bought this refurb...,"Seems like new, no hidden dirt visible, no scratches or scuffs. Really a very good deal.<br>I specifically chose this one to avoid 5G capability. I just don't want that radiation near me. 4G is good enough and hopefully will last as long as I will. Upgrading from a 6+, this has some differences to get accustomed to, but nothing too bad. Face recognition is interesting if a double edge sword. Miss the fingerprint home button and would prefer that. I like the cover switch to turn off the screen, but it took me awhileto find where to shut off the power when I wish to. Yeah, I'm old school enough to recall land lines without answering machines even, so not too hung up on being accessible 24/7/365 like so many younger folk. I do appreciate limiting contact tracing, it's nobody's business where I am.The camera is very nice, has some new features I appreciate, has me contemplating selling my Nikons even.Well, if you want to not have 5G rammed into your life (do your own research if you wonder why someone might feel that way), you might also consider this phone as an alternative.Oh yeah, the larger screen suits older eyes...!</br>",2021年3月10日 在美国审核

Horribly Damaged,"When I received my phone, I already could see how damaged I received it...1. There was too much dust in the speaker area.2. After I recharged and called, I found out how horrible the sound was. We had the volume fully on the highest limit, however, we couldn't hear anyone. Distance wasn't the issue either. It sounded very cave-like and leave that apart, it was so hard to hear and comprehend.

Great price  and very satisfied with the quality.,"I bought two of these and they were in perfect condition.I was very leery of purchasing used phones due to the mixed reviews. I also didn’t want to jump right on here and leave a positive review without testing them for a little while. We’ve now had the phones for about a month and zero issues.Both phones were cosmetically perfect, and looked brand new. One phone had 100% battery health and the other was 94% which is pretty good.All features and functions work perfectly on both devices.I would definitely purchase again and recommend this seller.",2020年2月1日 在美国审核
Excellent deal,It really is like new. Battery health at 95%. No scratch. Came with glass screen protector perfectly installed. No issue with front and back camera. Face recognition very fast. It is a Sept 2018 model so 1.5 year old. Plenty more to go.,2020年6月5日 在美国审核

It doesn't come with the original box or headphones, but that's ok, they included charging cable and the brick.Sure its nice to have the newest generation iPhone, but the iPhone XS Max is still a beast and should hold its own comparing with iPhone 11, 11 pro or 12, 12 pro.

HOWEVER!The phone hardware and functions looked legit.. BUT.. the gold chrome edges were totally fake.. the buttons were fake feeling and really smooth (compared to the same phone my friend got from Apple and another one from BestBuy, those phones buttons felt sharper, the refurbished one felt really polished and smooth, so not the same as a the legit ones) ALSO my phone silent/vibration button was sunken into the edges level, original edges has that button a little bit up level of the volume buttons.. that was the main fake detail I noticed..And the little stripes at the sides kinda up and down idk how to describe them felt like a gap.. original phones is all smooth.I think I just got that special phone.. maybe was an original phone and just got the chrome edges replaced at the refurbishment process.. maybe if you buy a phone you’ll get everything legit.. but wasn’t my case so I decided to return it.",2020年8月14日 在美国审核

"Pretty good, very satisfied","So, I can’t share pictures of the phone itself and the physique because I forgot to snap pics once I got it, but if I could I would! I had a little bump with getting it on time due to issues with FedEx. The company was a little rude when I tried explaining, but eh I can overlook that because if the satisfaction so far with the product! Y’all in the details you’re promised AT LEAST 80% battery life.. I was expecting around that, but when I looked I’ve actually got 100% battery life!! This phone basically new! The physique isNo scratches, or ANY sign of wear! It was fully unlocked, and had no problems connecting it with my current provider. It does not have a SIM Card but they’re not very expensive at a store. Probably around $10 if that. I’m overall pretty satisfied! I had a 6s Plus for over a year, so pretty happy with this upgrade. It also came with an actual Apple charger which I also wasn’t expecting. I do wish they would include some headphones, but it’s all good. I’ll tune back in a couple of months to update how it’s been since! Every thing about it works awesome!***fast forward to March of 2012: I still like the phone, although I’m starting to think the battery life was changed before they sold it. It does rather fast on me, and takes forever to charge. My 6s would last at least another 30 mins on 1%! This one starts to lag as soon as it hits 2% and once it’s at 1% is dies. So I’m pretty bummed about that cause sometimes you don’t have your charger on hand to connect right away. I play CoD sometimes with my siblings and my battery goes down sooooo fast with it. I can maybe play 4 rounds before I get the low battery warning. My only issue I suppose I’ve had is the battery life. Other than that the phone still works pretty good. ♀**fast forward one year later**It’s pretty decent phone. I’m a heavy user so it’s gone down from 100% battery life to 90%. Batteries are replaceable at any Apple Store though for $50. I found the issue with the charging situation was the charger they sent. I don’t believe it was an actual apple charger, but either way this phone requires one of the newer charging boxes. I purchased one, and it charges in less than an hour. I haven’t really had much problems with it, and I’m still pretty satisfied with it. I would like to upgrade to an iPhone 11 though simply because I’m bored of this one ",2020年10月24日 在美国审核
like brand new,"I was honestly shocked when I received my refurbished phone because not only was it in a resealed apple box for the phone but I also received a brand new apple charger and cable as well. there is virtually no damage that I could find at all on the phone. the only thing I could find to show it was even refurbished was a little goo on the side of the screen where the screen had been replaced but it easily came off and looks perfect. the battery life is wonderful, the camera is amazing. both my Bluetooth and wifi work wonderfully. I'm beyond overjoyed at how wonderful the phone is and how cheap I got it compared to a brand new one. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a refurbished phone.

"First experience with iPhone:  a very mixed bag, mostly positive","The renewed iPhone XS Max I purchased recently has been mostly a great performer with a few ""gotchas,"" mostly related to my inexperience with IOS but there are a couple of things you may want to be aware of generally:1.)""Renewed"" vs ""Renewed Premium.""Originally I was looking at a ""renewed premium"" version of the iPhone XS Max with 256GB internal storage; the price was almost $60 more for the premium renewed version.The biggest difference I could see outside of the longer warranty was that the premium phone was ""guaranteed"" to have 90% or more of maximum battery capacity available while the mere ""renewed"" phone was guaranteed to have 80% or more.I chose to save $60 and roll the dice; it paid off:93% maximum capacity remaining.Nice.2.)Condition of the phone on arrival.I have to admit, I was a little concerned when I opened the outer shipping box and saw that the box containing the phone had minimal bubble protection around it and was actually loose in the shipping box.However the phone box was solidly constructed and held the device securely in place.It was not an original Apple box so I didn't get the cool ""outer atmosphere of Jupiter"" phone image on the outside, nor was there an original Apple charger or earbuds included inside.Not to worry; there was a USB-C to lightning cable and a 30 watt fast charging adapter included (I'll take that over earbuds any day).The gold-color phone itself was packaged in shrink-wrap front and back and, for all intents and purposes, looked like a brand new phone.As a long-time Android user who'd never owned anything above a mid-range smartphone, the XS Max is the second most impressive phone I've ever held in my hand.The glass front and back with stainless steel frame makes quite the quality statement.I saw no noticeable flaws or scratches on the phone, but I did cover it in a protective case and added a screen protector right away so I could've missed something very miniscule.3.)Phone performance.Fast!Apps load quickly; scrolling, swiping, switching between apps, pages, screens seemed a bit smoother than my most recent Android device (Samsung Galaxy A71 5G). Did a Geekbench 5 performance test; needless to say, the A12 Bionic SOC blew away the Samsung's Qualcomm 765G chipset without breaking a sweat.But honestly when it came to actually putting the phone through the usual tasks, there wasn't much noticeable difference between the Apple and the Android machines.While the iPhone boasts a higher-resolution OLED display than the Samsung's Super AMOLED display, I still found myself preferring the Samsung's screen because of the extra .2"" of screen area, an advantage made even more noticeable because of the iPhone's more rounded edges and at times annoying screen notch.4.)Differences between IOS and Android.Keep this in mind:I am a long-time Android user and this is my very first experience with an iPhone.Have to ask, though:how do you long-time iPhone users live without the ability to close all your apps with a single tap, close all your (Safari) browser tabs in the same way or live without a ""restart"" button plus having to press two buttons to turn your phone off?I'm adjusting but my heart goes out to all of you who've been long deprived of those little conveniences.If Apple made those tiny changes and cut the price of the iPhone 12 Mini in half, they'd own the smartphone space.It's here that I have to acknowledge the one huge advantage iPhones have over Android phones:long-term OS updates.Eight-year old Android phones do not get Android 12; they're stuck with 4.4.4 or 5.1 if memory serves me right.A dear friend who has owned an iPhone 6S Plus she purchased new when it was first released (recently replaced with an iPhone 11) updated that phone to IOS 14.6 just before she purchased her new one.Advantage Apple in a big way.So far, I have to say I'm very happy with this iPhone and, by extension, the seller and their description of the phone; both have exceeded my expectations.If this XS Max holds up, I don't see me buying another phone for at least five years or more.And despite my affinity for Samsung phones and the Android OS, that next phone will probably be an iPhone.",2021年8月12日 在美国审核

I'm thrilled!,"Zero issues, totally love this phone. It's an upgrade for me. It works flawlessly and is even easier to use than a prior version. The bigger screen is nice. The edge to edge is nice. The camera, I LOVE the features! Some old ones are back, with huge improvements. That's a *big* deal for me. Charging time is fine. It did take me a little bit to get adjusted to the no home button, and a few other minor things. The chip size gives me the freedom to save whatever I need. The clarity of the screen is excellent. The phone is slim and lightweight. I like the feel of this phone, the size, and if you need it bulked up, you can get a heavier case for it. I picked a case that isn't that heavy. Now all I need to do is add an extra glass protector to keep the screen safe. I'm so, so, SO happy with this phone!",2021年2月7日 在美国审核

Worth the $500!,"My mom bought this phone to upgrade from her iPhone XR. She was interested in a larger phone at the time, and she was so pleased once it arrived in the mail. The only con I will mention is that the shipping notifications were completely off. Amazon showed that the phone wasn't to be delivered for a week or a little longer, but she received the phone in a couple of days. With this, the money wasn't taken out of her account until almost a week of her having the phone. It was very frustrating, and Amazon wasn't aware of this issue either. We had to call Amazon to inform this of this issue and even then, it took them another couple of days to withdraw the money from her account. But overall, the phone works exceptionally well and it was $500 well spent!",2021年5月27日 在美国审核

Extremely disappointed.,"So I’ve had this phone since March. When I first got it, it did not turn on at all and I thought that the battery must’ve have been dead so I charged it for a few minutes and it surprisingly turned on. Loved it since I got it/ everything worked except one thing. It randomly turns on and off, whenever I set the phone down and try to turn it back on it takes from 5 minutes up to a few days for it to turn back on. It is now May and this phone is completely useless, if I set it down for even a second it will turn off and not turn back on until days later. I’m guessing amazon did not fully refurbish this phone because it clearly has a hardware problem which is the turning off randomly without being prompted and I have filed for a return. I do not recommend buying from this seller.",2021年4月20日 在美国审核

Excelente producto,"Yo al igual que ustedes tenia mis dudas sobre si comprar un celular IPhone (renewed o también llamado renovado) y la verdad es que fue la mejor compra que hice. Quería un IPhone para la escuela y para jugar, y esta opción fue la mejor que hice, ya que su procesador hace que todo te vaya fluido, no vas a tener ninguna traba con ningun juego actual, el celular me llego con una estética de 9.9 ya que tenía un ligero pero muy ligero raspón en una de las esquinas pero para verlo tienes que tener una lupa, es imperceptible a simple vista, vino con una caja y un cargador muy genérico. Lo que yo recomiendo es que ya tengas un cargador turbo de IPhone con su respectivo cable para que no tengas ningún problema, y no incluye audífonos, prácricamente estás pagando lo del dispositivo. Me llegó con 92% de pila que es perfecto y todo viene al 100, no tengo ninguna falla, la batería le dura prácricamente todo el día de uso intenso.Ventaja: Pagas por el dispositivo y te va a salir muy bienDesventaja: Tienes que comprar cargador, cable y audífono a parte para tener una experiencia completaPD: Yo lo compré en unos 10 - 11 mil pesos mexicanos, si lo alcanzas a comprar a ese precio es muy recomendado ya que de unos 14 para arriba mejor opta por un iphone 11 o incluso 12",2021年4月14日 在墨西哥审核

Se Calienta DEMASIADO :(,"El teléfono se calienta en EXCESO, lo noté desde el primer día, sin embargo creí que era normal hasta cierto punto por las configuraciones iniciales y transferencia de datos de mi otro IPhone y así, así que le di el beneficio de la duda 3 días más para probarlo, pero ya no me empezó a gustar cuando abría algún juego (que ni siquiera comenzaba a jugarlo) y subía la temperatura de la parte trasera MUCHSIMO en específico alrededor de la cámara, a tal grado que si lo ponía en la piel quemaba.<br>Otras ocasiones al encenderlo y sin hacer nada más también subía rápidamente la temperatura, lo probé checando el sistema y a cada rato aparece que la temperatura es GRAVE, entonces lo tengo que dejar enfriar(al ponerlo en el piso que está frío y ya baja a temperatura normal, pero tengo que estar haciendo esto a cada rato y eso que en estos tiempos ya llueve y hace algo de frío, me pregunto que pasará en tiempo de calor???.Ya tuve una mala experiencia aos atrás con un IPhone 5S que se calentaba de la misma manera y al mes se daó la tarjeta madre y ya no tuvo remedio y por los $10,200 que me costó éste no estoy dispuesto a pasar por lo mismo, ahorita estoy en proceso de devolución y esperando respuesta de AMAZON y el vendedor ""BEST 11"" en cuanto se concrete el segumiento/devolución actualizaré mi resea, a continuación dejo puntos a favor y en contra del equipo, ya que en general no es malo, el detalle es que se calienta en exceso y eso no deja de ser una falla que si hubieran revisado y calado bien el teléfono no tuvieron ni porque haberlo ofertado.Puntos a DESTACAR:- Llegó antes de lo esperado.- Llegó con una condición de batería al 93%.- Llegó con un cargador genérico de un XS bonito.- Estética de un 9 en general.Puntos en CONTRA:- Se calienta DEMASIADO.- Se cierran algunas aplicaciones de la nada (ésto al subir la temperatura del equipo).</br>",2021年10月2日 在墨西哥审核

Prácticamente es un juego de azar que te llegue bien o mal el equipo,"Un poco de mi experiencia con Amazon renewed.Hice la compra de un xs max de 64 Gb, estuve analizando varios vendedores en Amazon renewed y todos tenían buenos comentarios y malos comentarios, también en internet vienen varias reseas de compras de celulares en esta misma modalidad de renewed, algunos su experiencia fue muy buena y la de otros muy mala, es como si fuera al azar, en fin. Escribo esto un mes después de que adquirí el equipo y describiré lo malo y lo buenoEmpezando por lo malo: 1. El celular venía raspado de ambos cristales como se aprecia en las fotos, los cuales si se notan a un brazo de distancia, como si al dueo anterior se le hubiera caído en el asfalto sin funda protectora, así como los bordes del mismo, venían golpeados2. Trae ligeramente pantalla fantasma casi imperceptible pero si lo miras detalladamente se puede observar bien, con el modo oscuro no se nota3. La batería venía con 81% de vida (en eso estoy de acuerdo que Amazon menciona que llegan de 80% para arriba) sin embargo eso significa hacerle un cambio de batería en un futuro cercano.Ahora si los puntos buenos de mi compra:1. Llegó al día siguiente2. Viene con todas sus piezas originales, me tomé la molestia de usar una herramienta para escanear todo el hardware y viene como salió de fábrica3. A pesar de que la batería venía al 81% le dura poco más de 24 horas en un uso normal4. Funciona Face ID5. La pantalla es la original (nada mas ese detallito que mencioné anteriormente)6. Aparentemente nunca se ha abierto el equipo7. Las cámaras funcionan perfectamente8. La pantalla no venía estrellada (solo raspada)9. Si venía liberado de fábrica como lo mencionanSi bien en mi caso no me fue tan mal al adquirir este iPhone he visto unos comentarios que no son tan satisfactorios pero como digo es cuestión de suerte, supongoEstaré actualizando este comentario si algo más se llegará a presentar, les recuerdo que esto lo escribo con un mes usándolo",2022年6月20日 在墨西哥审核

However the large screen and the presence of keyboards makes it ideal for web surfing, you can use desktop pages without any problems.Camera is not the best one you can get from the market, but it was way better than I expected.Don't know about headphones, but speakers are awesome on this phone and I love watching videos with this thing.",2015年2月1日 在美国审核

The battery life is something to marvel about on average with heavy use I get 10+ hours out of it with out charging top ups in day I do believe that I maxed out around 15hrs before I hit the 20% mark. There is a list of features that come with the device almost to many to list but the ones that immediately come to mind is bbm this is the ultimate communication companion which I recommend to everyone I know it is great for messaging and keeping in touch with everyone who has it (this app is cross platform so you can download via google play and or the apple store) as a bbm member which is of no charge I might add having this phone brings out all the features. If both parties have the phone not only text message with efficiency (message confirmation and delivery is almost instant) there is voice and video chat, the voice chat is available for all phones that download the app but the video chat is exclusive to blackberry customers. The video chat is amazing you really have to experience it to appreciate it but while you are in this video chat you can screen share it is like doing a presentation on you phone. The keyboard is sturdy I came from a all touch screen so I was in static to get a keyboard back but I you will not be typing with one hand that is not going to happen without dropping the phone unless you have the hands of Goliath! The speakers are great for those times that you need it, the camera takes great shots and speaking on camera and video there is a built in app that makes awesome videos it is called story maker it is basically a video maker and editing software. One of the greatest features of buying this phone which is not available on the other blackberry devices is blend. If you are a computer user this app is a must have to sum it up it is a extension of the phone on your computer or laptop to clarify a little better lets say you are on your computer with this app is opens a window which displays the messages on your phone and you have access to the flies on the device without ever having to pick it up and without a wire. This is only the tip of the iceburg with this beast of a phone and unfortunately I have to leave for work lol. If you would like to know more feel free to ask I will be glad to answer any questions you may have if I can another great review of some of the features http://utbblogs.com/backtoblack/a-month-with-the-blackberry-passport/",2014年11月6日 在美国审核

Stand Out In The Crowd!,"I have had the BlackBerry Passport for about a week now, and must say I am totally loving it!I have always been a diehard BlackBerry fan dating all the way back to the BlackBerry Pearl! However, in recent years I have been using both Android and Apple, I even dabbled in the Windows world for a brief stint...but I've always kept my eye on what BlackBerry was doing!<br>This device is great for anyone who is a professional looking for a sturdy, well-built machine that will get them through the day with ease! Long gone are the days of having to plug my phone in by 2PM...I can literally go 2 days before having to charge this sucker...and that's saying a lot since I'm still in the ""infatuation phase"" and unable to put this beauty down!!!I am not a huge app person but do have the usual social media apps, banking apps and photo editing apps loaded on my phone. I find between BlackBerry App World, Amazon and Google Play (through SNAP) that I am quite satisfied with the app selection.I am still learning all the flicking gestures while I type but am getting the hang of it, one day at a time! The layout of the keyboard is great, takes some adjustments compared to previous BlackBerry keyboards but nothing too crazy.I find it to be quite hilarious how many people ask me about this device, they make very snide remarks about BlackBerry still being around, the shape of the phone and its size. My comeback to them usually has something to do with daring to be different! Why lose your phone in the crowd when you can actually be the one to stand out in the crowd!If you've been looking at this phone for a while, do yourself a favor and BUY IT!!! You won't regret it!</br>",2015年4月6日 在美国审核
Worth every penny - best phone I've ever owned,"tl;dr version: Owned and loved since October 6, 2014. Screen, battery life, speakers and Android app performance are all incredible.Now the full story:I used Android phones starting with the T-Mobile G1 in 2008, and then the G2 in 2010, but in 2012 I happened to use an old BlackBerry Curve 8900 for six months while studying abroad. It blew my mind that this simple, well-built device with a low res screen and camera and slow processor was so useful in a way that my larger, more ""powerful"" HTC device hadn't been. Shortly after I got home, the Z10 and BB10 were launched, and I knew I had to switch to BlackBerry completely. The Z10 was a faithful and productive companion for a year and a half, but I longed for a good combination of powerful hardware and physical keyboard (the Q10 didn't win my heart, because ultimately the screen was just too small for me). Now the Passport has fulfilled every BlackBerry wish I had. It's beautiful and fits nicely in your hands, typing is fun (!) and you wouldn't believe how much screen space you have until you see it in person. The battery still has nearly 75% after I get home from work in the evening, despite moderate to heavy use (frequent web browsing, email/texting, streaming Rhapsody and Nobex radio). People see it and go, ""Is that a phone?"" and I love being able to respond with, ""Yes, it's a BlackBerry!"" and then surprise them with the new, fantastic OS and the keyboard gestures (which work great, by the way - not a gimmick as I had feared). I'm only sad that I have to keep it in a case for fear of dropping it, which detracts a little from the beauty of the device. Other than that, it's the best phone I've owned. And, as others have mentioned, yes, it DOES fit in your pocket.",2014年10月23日 在美国审核

"Wonderful phone, but portly...","This is a very interesting phone - I like the capacitive keyboard, which works well with the design of the operating system. The phone runs OS10 extremely fast, and is a huge step up from the Q10. The screen is also beautiful with incredible resolution. Build quality seems excellent - will see how it holds up. Battery life is incredible, and beats any other smartphone I have used (except for maybe my old 9790). There is only one thing that I don't like about the phone - and that is the size - it is quite large - it does fit in most of my pants pockets, but this thing is big - there is really no way to use it one handed for typing. It is usable one handed (due to availability of swipe gestures on keyboard and screen) for reading articles.I think people make too much of a perceived 'app gap' issue with the phone. 90% of the apps that I use on the phone are Blackberry OS10 apps. The other 10% are android apps that I use infrequently. I think the 'app gap' that many reviewers harp on is overblown.",2014年11月16日 在美国审核

7/10 as compared to a iPhone 6 Plus,"This is by far the best blackberry device ever...no doubt about that. This is also the most innovative mobile phone in the market as of today. The keyboard makes it the most innovative mobile product in the market. With the kind of battery life and Blackberry app functionality, this will prove to be a professional's workhorse. For someone who loves to write long e-mails or take good nates on the phone, they will love the keyboard and the soft typing experience that it provides. The Blackberry HUB with the concept of work &amp; conversation FLOW is top notch and unbeatable in the market (the iOS system fails big time in this functional area). The Blackberry BB10 is truly multi functional, multi operational (i was running a phone call with another person while attending a WEBEX without disconnecting), I run youtube in the background all the time while replying back to my emails. The BBM Meetings are an awesome way to connect for work...The Blackberry Blend is so good that I have stopped using anyother e-mail/ communication client....This blackberry is so well built that I dropped it from a height or ~ 5 feet on concrete and there were no cracks...heck the call too didn't get disconnected....had it been an iPhone it would have cracked a screen and would have needed expensive repair....amazingBUT it cannot yet compete with the iPhone6 Plus that I carry along with this Blackberry. The iPhone is part of a bigger apple ecosystem that provides more functionality throughout the ecosystem as compared to the Blackberry 10. Also, the iPhone has better apps to make the life to a person who is on the road in a different city each week...the iPhone has truly replaced ~70% of my laptop (that to the apple ecosystem and the secure functional apps).....something that the Blackberry has not been able to do.so Blackberry - AWESOME work... the things that you need to do now:1. Build a secure ecosystem for enterprise users. you are almost there with BES and such a great mobile device.2. Make 'Built for Blackberry' APPS that are more functional....don't lose the game so close to the finish line by telling your users to use cross platform apps from Android - They don't provide the same ""USER EXPERIENCE"" that a Built for Blackberry APP would provide.

Use it for work.,"I am nothing less than a gadget guy. I go through a lot of phones simply because I like different features at a given time.

My all purpose phone (iPhone 6) turned into a personal phone again and I was without calendaring and email.My first smartphone was a Blackberry back when they had monochrome screens. I still miss my thumb wheel. I teased my coworker for a long time that he was one of our last 5 Blackberry users in the company, but he wouldn't give up like I did long ago.Along comes the Passport. I've been stalking this phone for a couple months. Black Friday deal for $399 had me sold. I am now rocking two phones, one for work and one for me. Don't worry about using BES, ActiveSync on Exchange has served me well. It is true that the app ecosystem is light, but it has enough of the popular titles. In my experience the Windows Phone was suffering the same lack of titles, though there are probably more now. There are a few quirks to get used to, navigation can be a touch confusing sometimes.If I had to pick one phone to be stuck on an island with, it would not be this phone, I would still pick my iPhone. But I would send my Blackberry into battle with the information security zealots and dare them to wipe the data on this phone.

The keyboard works fantastic, mail continues to be one of the strong points of BlackBerry and the peace of mind you have knowing your information is secure from hackers attacks.Marketing (brands) rules people's minds and unfortunately people's minds seems to be set on Android &amp; IOS right now and they don't care about looking anywhere else for something different, so they overlookall the wonderful things BlackBerry's has been doing. I believed that's why this phone and BlackBerry 10 OS does not have the recognition and success they deserve...",2015年3月29日 在美国审核
and it is amazing! The ability to manage files,"I've had this phone for a week now, and it is amazing! The ability to manage files, e-mail, chats, etc. (""Blend"" as BlackBerry calls it) is seamless and convenient.Calls are clear, all communications are listed in one spot on the device (the ""Hub"").Yes, it's a different form factor than what's on the market now, but I think that's part of what makes the device so special!Plenty of screen space, rich colors, etc.The three row keyboard is a joy to type on, and the virtual fourth row adjusts itself to what you're typing so you don't have to hunt for special characters. A simple swipe motion adds words so you don't have to type them, and corrects your mistakes. I cannot recommend this phone enough!",2014年10月8日 在美国审核
Switched over from iPhone 6 and first time Blackberry owner.,"After watching tons of reviews I finally purchased the Blackberry Passport.The one thing that everyone pointed out was the fact that the App Store Is not the same.I have google play services running thanks to Colbalt232.It’s good but definitely not perfect.Face10 &amp; Inst10 [Blackberrys version of Facebook and Instagram] do cost $2.99 each.I haven’t purchased them yet nor do I even know If I want to pay Lolol.I’m currently using the browser to get on Facebook and Instagram.Not too much of a difference, but you can not upload multiple pictures using the browser.And of course no Snapchat [Not a big deal for me].Just In case anyone Is wondering google photos does not work..or at least for me.I often get messages In the hub stating that “I need google services In order for certain apps to run.”I’ve often encountered the problem of downloading apps but when I go to click on them all I get Is a black screen.Now the quality Is great.The feel and look of the device Is amazing.I love the shape and It’s definitely a conversation starter as Stated by everyone who has one or has reviewed the Passport.I have no complaints about camera quality and the battery life Is good also.I thought that maybe the keyboard would be a difficult thing to learn but It was surprisingly easy.",2018年3月6日 在美国审核

My Dreams Come True,"I have spent two years suffering with an iPhone and then an Android device. Well suffering might be an overstatement when it comes to having the ""apps"" that I love on my phone (something until now Blackberry could not offer me). I thought changing to get the latest ""cool"" apps would be just fine. I would learn to deal with the limited battery life and the touchscreen typing, and even learn to tolerate the ""pull down"" email to my device, for less than timely email exchange with others. Boy was I wrong. As someone who depends heavily on mobile productivity, the one sentence (keep it simple stupid) approach to emails and texts for business just did not cut it. I soon grew tired and longed for a Blackberry that could offer all I desired in the iPhone and Android device but with workhorse productivity - anywhere, anytime - never wondering where to find an outlet to charge my phone.The Blackberry Passport is just what the doctor ordered. Simply unbelievable. Back to real email and text messages, typed using a mixture of a touchscreen and seamlessly integrated thumb-controlled keyboard.Back to wicked fast ""push down"" email so my world is again all at my fingertips instantaneously. Back to two days (I kid you not) of battery life between charges. And that's in normal everyday use mixing phone, app, and messaging use. All of this in a perfect-sized device with the fastest processor in any phone (a Qualcomm Snapdragon), a screen right-sized to display documents so I can easily read them, and so I can easily comment about them while on the speakerphone at the same time. And all I hear from people who see this device is ""wow, that's cool, what is it?"" And I respond with great pride that what you're looking at is the best smartphone on the planet. But if you choose being like everyone else or are someone who is burdened by peer pressure, then this device is not for you. This device is for those among us who choose to be different, who follow their own path in life, chasing dreams and awakening the world. For those at BlackBerry, especially its designers, I tip my hat to you for a job well done.You nailed it - beauty and brawn in one device. The Passport is a game changer!",2014年12月15日 在美国审核

Passport a unique Blackberry device,"Blackberry has provided a new concept in keyboard functions with soft keys complementing the hard QWERTY keys. It is not a laptop or a tablet but a unique device with a wider, bigger screen running Blackberry OS 10 software than found on the traditional Blackberry device. It is called a passport I believe that it is about the same size and with the case closed it will drop in a shirt or suit jacket interior pocket. A ice feature supplied with the device are the ear buds. The device uses FD-NET signaling which limits the USA operations to carriers such as T-Mobile.

Five Stars,"Great battery life, very fast, excellent email. All I need in a business phone. Blackberry lost its way when the previous CEO tried to make a BB an iPhone or Android; didn't listen to what loyal BB users like myself wanted. When my 9900 had to be charged after half a day's use, that was it. I switched over to Samsung which, while it had features which were better than BB's, wasn't really core to productivity users. So I languished in the Android environment for three years and it was a godsend when the Passport arrived. I now have two - a black and a red.

"If you take this phone for what it's made to do, it's the best smartphone made to date","I was a diehard Google/Android user/dev/modder and switched to BB because of this phone. I've gone through 15+ devices in 2 years so I feel like I have some basis for this review. Of course there's going to be compromises with a BB, it's not a Google product. What I find fascinating is that people dock this phone and take stars off because it doesn't offer services from an entirely different OS/ecosystem. It's considered a stupid argument if someone bought an Android phone and started complaining that core iOS services didn't work, but everyone and their mom makes it a focal point when talking about BB.There is a patched Google Play Services and Google Services Framework that works for the Passport. Native YouTube and Drive and Maps and Google Play Music work fine. Core apps that require Google+ to login won't work, so things like Hangouts are a no go until someone figures it out. I don't do social media, so that stuff doesn't matter to me, but someone who uses Google+ religiously will find that a deal breaker unless the web app will suffice.I had a Google Voice number for years and actually ported my number out of Google just for this phone. I was the epitome of suckling on Google's teet; I wouldn't have left that unless it was worth it.Battery life is the best I've experienced on a phone yet, no setting up elaborate Tasker profiles to manage radios, I just leave them all on and can get 2+ days. OS is stable as a mofo, hasn't crashed once; can't say that about Android.I can go on and on. Just try the phone, the worst that can happen is you don't like it.

The clicks of the keys are extremely satisfying and I would be upgrading to the PRIV soon due to reasons disclosed below.

works for everything,"This will change everything about how you enjoy using a phone for productivity(work or school) as well as connecting with friends and family. Works fine on t-mobile. The big screen makes viewing so much easier. Desktop mode shows web pages so efficiently. Physical keyboard is there when you need it while the screen is only obstructed when necessary. Pictures are sharp and brilliant. BlackBerry has a wonderful ecosystem of users on twitter and crackberry.com. Sound is loud and clear. Fits easily in my pocket. Plenty of android apps and great BlackBerry apps. I was using a BlackBerry Q10. Great phone but Passport provides the screen real estate that makes a smartphone practical and more productive. The BlackBerry 10 operating system is very efficient, makes the others seem like slow-motion. It's worth the short learning curve for the boost in efficiency. I'm glad I took advantage of an Amazon Warehouse deal and saved a lot of money.January 2016 updateStill the best phone for productivity that I have ever seen. Just keep improving the OS. It's already great but see if you can make it even better. The square screen is criticized as odd but I find it to be more efficient than any other. The OS is great makes everything easy to access.

Great going back to a blackberry device,"I have used the passport now for a month.

I have not had to reboot the device other than once(ran the device to 0 level battery).The numerical keyboard is virtual and it took some time for me getting used to switching between the physical keyboard.I have not used the front and back cameras extensively but I found no issues for my needs.With regards to apps, I know there is a significant gap compared to ios and android devices.For me, the passport apps really worth having is the blackberry blend and the blackberry hub (both included with os device)Other features I like with the passport:The screen is excellent in terms of viewing websites in full desktop mode.Long battery life.

I'm glad that I've overcome my fears about the size,"I use my phone for almost everything. From answering emails from my students, checking their homework on the go, talking with my parents abroad, watching videos at the airport, listening music, taking and editing pictures for fun, sharing information with my coordinators, and so on. I'm a smartphone power user. I have a Samsung tablet that hasn't received an updated since I got it a year ago (with the promise that it that the best of the best at the time), also I have a very fancy and heavy laptop. However, my main device has been my Q10. I have used other devices (LG's, iphones, Nokias, Sony Ericsson, etcs) so I'm pretty much familiar with everything out there. Blackberry gave me freedom and made me feel secure about my information. At the beginning my Curve, them my Bold where a little behind of the other ""fancier"" flagship smartphones. But none of them could make what I wanted. So, I didn't make the switch. (Usually, as a smart buyer I don't follow the trends. First I do my research, balance the pros and cons, then I make my decision) I love my Q10. Perfect size, the keyboard is a masterpiece (fast and furios), but like with any device looses power with the abuse. I have been looking the reviews for the Passport, trying to keep a cold head regarding the super enthusiastic reviews and the super negative ones. The fact that you can't go to the store and try one was frustrating. However I decided to get one with a discount from Amazon (plus, they approved me for the Amazon.com store card and gave a $40 dsct) What I deal! $240 off.I'm going to be honest, when I opened the box I had my reservations. The phone looks huge and feels different in the hand (especially switching from a smaller Q10). I decided to give it a try (I could have returned the next 30 days). I'm a 5'4'', 129 lbs guy. I'm a short person. I use slim fit pants and jeans, also XS is my best fit in clothes. THerefore my main concern was: is it going to fit in my pockets? To my surprise, it fits perfectly in my jeans and pants (not in my shirts, though). Problem solved! I have small hands and I can use it mostly part of the time with one hand, however, 2hands is ideal and automatically you handle the device in that way after a few days. Does not bother me whatsoever.I've been using my Passport for 2 weeks now and I'm so happy to have overcome my fears. The screen estate is a win! Reading, watching, touching is a marvelous experience. It is super fast. Works, I think, at least 3 times faster than my Q10. The call quality is amazing. My office is in the heart of a building, under 4 floors of concrete, and most of the phones lose the signal once you get in into the building (included my Q10) However, this phone has at least 2 lines of coverage sitting on my desk (WINNER). 10.3 is a ridiculous OS. My Android apps load faster than in my students Samsung S4 (this amazed one of them because told me [Professor, I'm so sorry to tell you that BlackBerry is dead) When he tried my Passport recognized his mistake. Now is looking for a Z30. My students like it (even though they are iphone users) especially my pre-med students after I showed them the Nanthealth video. I have downloaded several games from the Amazon store and they are amazing on this square screen, not to mention the fast they are. Feel like they were made for this OS. I started to use Blend and I love it. I use my phone features in my laptop while it's charging.I'm not going to lie about the keyboard on this phone, took me some days to get used to it. That was almost my deal breaker. However, once you master it you love it. The word flipping is amazing, the touch feature is pure innovation. I use it to scroll up/down while I'm reading in landscape mode. (people go crazy when they see it) :pThese are my two cents for this amazing device. In my opinion, the best out there for both heavy users and regular users. Totally recommend to give it a try.",2014年12月12日 在美国审核

A Polished Device,"This is my first smartphone. I have owned two other devices in the last 10 years; both prepaid, basic Tracfones. So stepping up and buying this unlocked, I admit, was a bit of a hard pill to swallow (sticker shock), especially as a college student. Having no particular brand loyalty, I shopped around before I bought this device. I compared it to both the iPhone 6 (not the plus), Galaxy S5/S6, Motorola Droid Turbo, and the Nokia 930. While some people may disagree with me, I find that it makes sense to compare the passport to other well known flagship models currently on the market. If you are looking for a flagship phone, these are likely your top choices. Here is why I chose the Blackberry Passport over it's competitors.Keyboard: Some people like it, others hate it. If you are switching from a phone with a full touchscreen, it's a different experience. However, there are some advantages that I really appreciated. Mainly accuracy. Compared to my experience using my dad's work iPhone's over the years (he currently owns an iPhone 6) when at the cabin or in the car, accuracy was always an issue. In order to type what I wanted, I would often find myself looking at the keyboard in order to do so. With a physical keyboard, this problem goes away. Every key is in exactly the same place each time, and the keys have enough differentiation from one another, so I can tell when I am moving from one key to the next. Better yet, I can be focusing on something else other than the phone when I am typing a text or email up. In order to use it efficiently though, you do need both hands. So if you want a physical keyboard but often find one of your hands busy with something else, I strongly suggest getting a smaller phone. This phone is too big to type on one handed. A nice byproduct of this keyboard is it doubles as a track pad, similar to the blackberry's of old. Save's the screen from getting dirty and dinged up. Which leads me to my next point; durability.Durability: This phone feels strong. There is no hint of flex, even when it's in a pocket and I am bending over to get something or sitting down at a table. This is especially impressive considering the square shape of the phone and the resulting way it fits in my pocket compared to the competitors. The screen feels just as sturdy as any competitor, with the actual chassis of the phone easily beating the competition. Buttons all feel solid and the build quality is very good. For me, this is extremely important. I usually run my phones into the ground. Meaning I own them until the battery dies and it's cheaper to get a new phone than a new battery (how my first phone died after 4 years), or the phone totally breaks due to abuse(how my second phone died after 3 and a half years). I would not hesitate to take this phone on any of the Boy Scout trips I have gone on in the past (that includes Philmont and Sea Base, for my fellow Scouts). The phone itself has held up fine in my day to day college life without a case on it (though I did order one) and I expect to get a few years of use out of it without complaint.Integration: This is an extremely important point for me, and probably for most, can be the deciding factor on validating a purchase for this phone. I will start with social media and communication. Blackberry Hub easily beats the competition. It organizes all your email accounts, Facebook, twitter, gmail, yahoo, etc. into one logical and simple hub. You can adjust what you want to see, how you want to see it, and what priority it should have; among many other things. It's a one stop place to perform all actions involving communication and it does not require you to open any other apps to do it, like Facebook or twitter app's. As a busy college student during the school year, and an international freight logistics manager during the summer at my dad's work, keeping everything organized is as essential to me. This phone does it flawlessly. It far surpasses my dad's iPhone and my coworkers android devices. In addition, sinking up all events, contacts, meetings, etc. are extremely easy with this phone and in my experience, blackberry's in general. Far better than anything the competition offers.Ecosystem: I will be the first to admit, I miss some of the apps my dad has on his iPhone. Worse, some of the apps I do get, appear distorted due to the screen layout (it's square, meaning everything is compressed, compared the rectangular screens found on all its competitors). Blackberry has improved to include the amazon app store, so your no longer reliant on the emptiness found in blackberry world (or on Microsoft app store). I also heard you can side load Google play, but this is not an official thing. Simply put, this phone is not optimized for many of the gaming app's like angry bird, Netflix, etc. due to the screen shape. If you are indeed a heavy app user/gamer, I would say this is not the phone for you. However, if your more like me and really don't use you phone for doing activities like this, the passport is a powerhouse as a productive tool. I feel like I should point out though; of all the apps you have on your phone, how many do you really use on a regular basis? If it's a select few and the amazon app store and blackberry store contain what you need, this phone could work for you.General Cohesion: Taken as a whole, this phone is extremely fluid. The phone does not stutter when performing the tasks you want it to, and the system itself is extremely stable, with no crashes or weird lag. No matter if it's editing documents, composing email, or switching from a video to a phone call, this phone doesn't break a sweat. This is in steep contrast to my experience with windows phone where it crashed, and since the battery is not removable, you had to wait for the phone to die before it could be rebooted. Compared to apple and android, I would say it beats android, and is equal to apple, provided apple does not come out with another sub par system update. As a phone to live with everyday, it does not go out of it's way to try and make your life frustrating.Battery Life: It's excellent. I can get a full day of heavy usage easily without concern. I found if you leave the WiFi off especially, this phones battery life is phenomenal. Easily beats all of the competitors by a mile. If you are on the go and finding time to charge your phone is problematic at best, this phone was built for you. It's that good.Future Proofing: Something not normally considered, but as someone who likes to hang onto his devices for a while, this actually has some bearing on my phone/brand choice. I previously had a bad experience with the first generation Nexus 7 tablet where it slowed down a lot aftera year of use (if you Google this, you will find this is a common problem). So not wanting to experience that on a phone that I would likely own for 4-5 years, I made some inquires about long term support. I found out that apple and android (Google) stop updating and supporting their phones after a while eventually resulting in the owner needing to get a new phone since even some of the most basic tasks are no longer supported. Or worse, the phone gets so slow, it no longer becomes feasible to use it. Blackberry on the other hand (and windows to a lesser extent) offer far more long term updates and support, meaning I should not have to feel a need to upgrade my phone, unlike other competitors tend to ""encourage"". Another issue for me is security. Being a manager with contacts and coworkers all over the world (it's international freight logistics for a reason), making sure the work I am doing is secure is valuable to me. Seeing how phones are increasingly being targeting by cyber threats, and many users conduct sensitive information on their phones (banking, paying bills, doing work stuff), having a phone that provides secure service is a nice relief. Especially when traveling over seas. Blackberry continues to offer the best security protection out of anyone in the industry. They more or less built their entire enterprise on secure communication, and they have been doing it far longer than apple or Google has.Network: This is entirely subjective, as it the network provider that will have the biggest impact on the following items (note: I am on at&amp;t using the 4g LTE network).Call quality is extremely good. Far clearer than any other phones I have used. Even international calls come through as though they were on a land line. Compared to its competition, it crushes them. Sound quality from the speakers is equally impressive, better than any of the androids I experienced. Reception has been good, but depending on where you live, this could be a different story. I have yet to test this on a over seas network, but it should be acceptable, as it does support band found outside North America.Conclusion: This phone is not meant for everyone. If you value heavily using your apps and gaming and streaming Netflix, I hope you realize by now this phone will likely disappoint. However, if you like me value easily communicating with others and performing more work orientated tasks, this phone should be towards the top of your list. It has great integration, will survive what you subject it too (within reason), and will perform to your expectations for the foreseeable future. For me, it's a well polished product that meets my expectation and exceeds them where it needs to. If you think it will for you, I would encourage you to consider this phone.",2015年4月2日 在美国审核

"Excellent Features (BB Blend, Hub, Predictive Messaging) but Apps Ecosystem has to be developed.","Its a mixed thing to write a review on this phone; after a week or more of using it, moving from IPhone, you literally feel the IPhone has an archaic interface, and I am literally swiping the IPhone to wake it and check the Hub. Love to check the Blackberry Blend, which is a dream come true. But on the flip side you feel the loss of popular Apps, which we are so used to, so it gets frustrating.I really like the Blackberry Blend, the HUB, the Amazon Android Store (Thanks God) and SNAP to side load Android Apps (Thanks Thanks God :-)I like the fact that it has Exceptional Business Features which makes it a real good phone. The Predictive text literally cuts your entire message typing to nothing, its a pleasure to use it really.The other thing is that using this phone in a Car is Out of Question, too big to handle. So I have to cut out my texting and rely on Bluetooth for phone calls.BB10 User Interface is actually really good; pleasantly surprised but it really gets on to you after a week and it seems natural and sensible.So though I hate not having all apps and have to side load some, I still will keep the phone, it performs too well to let go and go back to IPhone, and the texting, and Blend and Hub are too good to let go frankly/",2015年1月20日 在美国审核
Quite the phone I wanted,"This is my second week having the phone and am pleased. Have owned a Sony UX, Nokia E90 Communicator, Nokia N900, Nokia N810, and a Samsung Note II. Always felt more comfortable with a physical keyboard, but also always wanted a phone with a large screen, while also wanting a microkernel Unix operating system close to my laptop's... this is the phone that I wanted.-It's pleasantly responsive opening/closing/switching between apps.-The keyboard has the best feedback I've ever felt.-The keyboard is touch sensitive, a feature I use all the time: moving text cursor, deleting previous word, opening up special characters menu, selecting one of the predictive text words, etc-With BB10/QNX Unix I feel confident in putting sensitive account info things in the phone.-Haven't had to chat in loud areas much but call quality is very high.-Blackberry Hub with putting email account and text messages together is awesome and succinct.-Apps gel together like making a todo 'Task' then it's in the Calender. Then on that day, or days, on time given, a message comes up saying the title of that task such as ""Home: [Blank] todo""*or* ""Amazon package: nootropics, dawn simulator, electric blanket "".-On the main menu, it's configurable to hold down a button to open an app, call someone, etc.-Don't use it much but Speech to Text got exactly what I said.-The case is sure beautiful.-There isn't the annoying phone settings/notification bar at the top of the screen taking up premium real estate for every app . In order to get to that though ya simply use two fingers at the top edge of the screen then slide down. One swipe down gives the menu for the app.-External speakers are loud enough that when watching Netflix I need to turn remember to keep the volume down.-Android's Netflix app : picture is cut off a slight amount, but haven't noticed one time where I missed relevant information to the story.-With the BB10 browser, youtube doesn't stop playing music when you turn off the screen.My favorite part though is getting around. It's concise and succinct. I'm busy. Life is short. Time is precious. I want something to take notes when I have some awesome idea, or something to quickly add to my needed shopping list before n number of other ideas and/or invention ideas pop out the previous one.This has the hardware and software and the style I've been looking for.Update:Cons:-None that bother me Too much.-You can't type with one hand.-If you're completely new to developing it was confusing for me to setup the right environment. Not sure how it is for Android or iOS. Though once setup it seems easy to test an app on the phone.-Developing via Python didn't work out. The instructions were old and failed for me on my first try. Maybe the author/maintainer can help. Since then I starting my journey with C++ which I'm Very Excited about. Not understanding C/C++ has been a huge issue for quite a while.-No Vim editor available on the phone :(The screen size and ratio are really pleasant to read on. One of the great aspects of the 1:1 ratio is now there's no temptation to flip the phone to read text better. For text it's really nice.To note: it's not some one clicker to get the Android Netflix on the phone. I used the Android 'Snap' Method that allows other Android apps to run on the phone too. I guess it's the whole Android Play store?It's not easy if you have little computer experience, but not impossible.

The Pinnacle of Smartphones!  No regrets with this purchase!,"I LOVE my new Passport.I will admit I am a Blackberry fanatic, but with that being said, I truly think this is an amazing smartphone.I will also say that pretty much all smartphones are good and do the same things these days, and it comes down to personal preference.But once you start using the Passport and get used to the tactile plus touchscreen keyboard and all the amazing and useful shortcuts, you will wonder where this phone has been all your life. Ahem.My previous smartphone was the Z10, and I was a bit worried I wouldn't like the size of the Passport or losing the size of a long and narrow screen.There is no looking back.Image quality is amazing, speed amazing, user interface top notch, nothing comes close.Once you get used to the size of the Passport, it really isn't that big.Its a unique shape that has broken the standard (boring) mold of every smartphone out there.Typing with a tactile keyboard has reduced the typing errors greatly and, is it ever nice to be able to see what message you are replying to, what you are typing and a keyboard, all at the same time.And for those that claim there aren't enough apps for Blackberries, I have 2 comments.1) How will one billion apps change your life for the better? (most are probably junk) And those that are truly useful are most likely available in all formats or very similar apps are available. 2) With the Amazon App store there are now more apps available to the Blackberry users.Once you use this smartphone, you will never regret it.",2015年2月21日 在美国审核

Are we beyond the era for physical keyboards?  4 Stars but didn't work for me...,"Context:- I have been looking for a phone with a physical keyboard for when I need to type a lot on the go.- I have owned many blackberries in the past. At least 5 of them over the years.- I do not care about the lack of apps on this platform so that is not even a consideration.Summary:- I liked that blackberry took a risk in coming out with this phone but several reasons led me to return it.- Many people have already written about what makes this phone great, so I will focus mostly on why it didn't work for me.- While the phone didn't work for me for the reasons below, I am rating it a 4 because it is overall a good device and I can see for the right person that this phone could be great.I also think it's important to recognize and reward BB for their risk taking in innovating with a new form factor.Reasons:- While the largish screen is nice, the 1:1 aspect ratio is quite a limitation when trying to read pdfs.Specifically, with a phone with a normal aspect ratio, it is possible to rotatethe phone into landscape mode so that you can read the entire width of a letter sized document at reasonable text size.Not so with the Passport.This means that the only way to read pdfs with even normal text at a comfortable size is to zoom in and the scroll left and right as you read down the page.This is extremely tedious as you can imagine.- I discovered that the missing third row of keys was an issue for me.I thought I would be able to adapt quickly and I actually enjoyed having softkeys for some things.I didn't even mind the difference in feel between the softkeys on screen and the physical keys.However, missing the third row and requiring softkeys for numbers made typing much slower than I had hoped.I wonder why they didn't include the alt-key combo functionality?- It's tiring to type on this keyboard for any period of time.I don't ever remember having issues like this with blackberries before.I don't know if it's the weight of the phone or the balance of the device or the feel of the keys.Or perhaps it's just because I've become used to and good at typing softkeys on glass.No matter the reason, the keyboard was not comfortable to use over time.- The device is not comfortable to *hold* in one hand.I did not expect to be able to *use* it one-handed, but expected that it would be manageable to hold it one handed when I was reading something.Not so.The sharp angles on the phone, which I think make the phone look nice, made it uncomfortable to hold.I suspect this is why the AT&amp;T version has rounded corners.- Overall, having used and tried to like this device for a week (I even bought a screen protector and back case for it), I was surprised to discover that I could still type much faster and more comfortably on glass.While I have been a blackberry fan, I wonder if softkeys and improvements in auto-correct have made it so that people can now type faster on glass than on physical keys.Specifically, I thought I was looking for a phone with physical keys but maybe that's not needed any more and in fact is slower.Is it possible that the market and consumers have moved on and physical keys are not really needed even for people who thought they needed it?p.s.I rarely write reviews but am doing so mostly as feedback to BB.I don't want to be stuck in a world dominated by iOS and Android.I hope that BB stays in the hardware game. I hope BB can take all the feedback, positive and negative, and continue to improve.Maybe they can make the physical keyboard better so that it can outshine glass again?",2015年5月4日 在美国审核

Terrible Support....,"UPDATED REVIEW:So here's an update to my review.Blackberry support is terrible.Up until I've been very happy with my passport.Recently starting dropping calls.Worked with my carrier (T-mobile, who, by the way, gets 5 Stars for their support!), replaced the SIM, updated software, wiped device.Eliminated everything except the device iteself.Called Blackberry and their support tells me that for units purchased on Amazon the only way to get support is to post on an online ticket.For a company that is supported by a small, passionate and loyal user base they sure don't give a damn about us in return.I was using the BB Passport as my primary email phone and the LG G4 for everything else.I'd like to get my Passport working again, but after my experience today there's no way I'll pay another $400-500 for a phone that comes with ZERO support.OLD REVIEW:Bar none, the absolutely best phone out on the market today. I carry two phones with me (one being a Blackberry Passport, which replaced the Blackberry Bold (didn't care for the Q10), the other an LG G3 Android phone.Prior to the Blackberry Passport I was using the Blackberry Bold and Android phones roughly 50/50 as each had their strengths.With the new Blackberry Passport I find that I'm 80/20 on the Blackberry vs the LG G3 (which, in my opinion, is the second best phone available, and definitely the best Android handset).There's very few things that the Blackberry Passport doesn't do exceptionally well.You can install ANY Android app (either using the Amazon App Store or directly from the Google Play Store using Snap) and I have yet to find one that doesn't run perfectly.Keyboard took me roughly a week to get used to.With the older Blackberry Bold I found that I was able to type around the same speed as on the LG G3 with a custom swype keyboard.Initially I was slower on the Bold, but due to the new keyboard features on the Passport I'm actually now even faster on the Bold or the LG G3.This phone is the only phone that I've seen that has introduced new and revolutionary features. Touch-sensitive keyboard is phenomenal.Battery life is unreal (2 full days of heavy use, whereas my LG G3 is typically dead by 4pm on day 1).If you watch a ton of videos on your phone then the screen format isn't ideal and this is not a phone you'll enjoy.For anything else (email, web browsing, normal apps, etc) this phone kicks butt.",2014年12月13日 在美国审核

Love this phone!,"I bought this phone from Amazon used with a condition of ""Like New"".The disclaimer was ""Item will come in original packaging and packaging will be damaged"".I saved a little over $90.00 by purchasing the phone this way and it was well worth it.The box was indeed damaged, but there was not one cosmetic imperfection on the phone or any of the included accessories.The phone came with what looked like an AT&amp;T nano SIM card in it.T-Mobile is my carrier so I simply went to one of their stores and had them activate a nano SIM and was on my way with the passports voice and data working fine in less than 15 minutes.They didn't even charge me for the micro SIM, but I'm sure that depends on the store and rep you deal with.All I can say is that I am in love with this phone.I came from a galaxy note 2 which was a very nice phone as well.I was just looking for something different than android or iOS and this caught my eye as it is definitely different.I haven't used a blackberry since my son had a curve some years back and I would have to constantly restore the OS because he would always manage to get an ""Uncaught Exception"" error.I couldn't stand the OS back then but this BB10 OS is very nice indeed.The phones hardware and OS are a perfect marriage making all tasks move swiftly.The physical keyboard allows me to actually look at other things besides the keyboard and type with no typos whatsoever which I could not do on a virtual keyboard.The large square screen is beautiful and I no longer have to turn the phone sideways to view a non-mobile website.I have had many people ask me about the phone and say how nice it looks.The phone is big but fits fine in my pockets and I can type one handed on the phone although my hands are big and I would imagine that most people would find it uncomfortable to do if they can even do it all.The battery life is seriously unbelievable.As I write this, I am going on 18 hours without charging the phone and my battery is sitting at 42%.I have had my Bluetooth radio on all day, received well over 100 emails, replied to around half of them, used remote desktop for about 20-30 minutes, BBM'd for a bit, sent and received texts all day, received and made many phone calls including one for just over an hour, played TunnelX at least 10 times, watched a dozen or more YouTube videos, and have browsed many websites as well.So to have 42% battery left after all this and 18 hours after my last charge is simply amazing to me as none of my previous smart phones could even come close to lasting this long.The apps available for this OS can leave a lot to be desired if you come from android or iOS.However, you can apparently load apps from BB World and android apps via the Amazon app store but I have only installed apps from BB World and not many of them.Even still, what I have installed is sufficient for me since my phone is used more for business than entertainment and for that purpose it seems to fit like a glove.Nevertheless my 4 teenage boys look at it in awe and surprisingly aren't concerned about the lack of entertainment apps but want to learn how to use the OS so go figure.For me it is definitely a keeper and I look forward to discovering the cool features it has.",2015年1月17日 在美国审核

Red Blackberry Passport - Love at first sight,"With the Blackberry passport, you either 'love it' or 'hate it' and in my case, I absolutely Love It!The red does add that extra touch to the phone, absolutely beautiful.I use it for business and personal use - an all rounder in my opinion. The keyboard and touch screen feature is a big plus, not to mention the ease of seeing a full screen website as opposed to trying to increase the size etc.If you are looking for a phone that is great for work emails, amazing battery life, functional and looks like a business phone - then i highly recommend this, you won't be disappointed.",2015年1月5日 在美国审核

a work horse,"A great phone in modern era.I switched from a iPhone 5.First it felt very awkward not because of size but because of lack of fluidity of the apps.I have to agree ios is way ahead,the ecosystem is vast. But if you want to be different, you want a better browser, better sound quality, better signal reception ,better viewing experience then you can give it a try. To be very honest I was faster in typing in ios8.still it's a joy to type on a passport. Believe me you will love it. I am getting battery life of 24 hrs on an average on moderate use. Apps in amazon appstore are outdated.still useful in someway. BlackBerry world apps are excellent. I request blackberry to bring back the medscape native app.The amazon medscape app really sucks. I tried downloading apps from snap,but later I uninstalled snap as I was little bit uncomfortable to share my google account and password with a third party client. Games even from amazon appstore run smooth, but that's not the reason you should buy this phone. Video nah!!! Music excellent. What I need some useful native blackberry apps optimised for passport.

"I love it, but not made to me (heavy duty)","I love it but...I have to say that I love this device indeed, I really love the way it works. When I first change my old iPhone 5s I was not pretty were about the change because I have been using the iPhone about 3 years and I was happy with it.So, the first week of use of the passport was pretty kind of weird, because I have to use to the functionality and the size, but then I start to understand the device and wow, I was amazed because I never thought all the things you can be able to do with a smartphone, suddenly I was replying and composing emails and text messages fatly, and I have all my notifications in just one place. Old email attachments was easily to find and compose a new email. It was great. I really really love the blackberry hub.About the size of the device I start to feel great because also I was reading papers on a screen that is pretty comfortable.Happiness and butterflies was all about the passport, but well bad things happens sometimes. I read before other reviews that said that this smartphone was hardcore, I mean to heavy duty and made for but it seems the designers never contact a person like to test the device, because after the first drop the screen begins to detach and the camera starts to fail too. The main camera doesn’t work properly anymore, it struggles a lot to focus,All the other stuff does work properly, and I talk about the touchscreen and the software.I have to admit when my iPhone drops suddenly of my hands, the device got some scratches, but it always work properly and never had any issue with.I live in Mexico, and I am struggling a lot because I cannot find any service center in here, I found one but since I buoyed my passport here on Amazon they can't help me to check the device.This device is great, I am fan of it. But really Blackberry you should contact me before you launched this device to the market because I barley have about 5 months using it and I am thinking on change it.If you are a very careful person, and you and I mean never let drop thins on the ground you should totally buy this device.

Excellent Phone; just hope it doesn't die on me soon.,"I've had this phone for almost 2 months now. I really love many things about this phone. I've been a power user of mobile phone since mobile phones were invented; including most blackberries and iPhones up to the 5s.If You don't mind a large format, want a phone mainly to work and be productive, handles emails like no other portable device, excels at showing spreadsheets, with a real keyboard and a fantastic, large screen viewable on the brightest of sunlight, then this is a phone for You.It's also refreshing that one can load snap to access practically all apps made for Android via the google app store (though the blackberry store is getting a little better). Instlling snap is done through a somewhat ""techy"" sideloading process, but easy enough even for those more technically challenged.Battery life is actually very good considering all the power this phone has and all it can do. Even in heavy use, You won't get to the end of the afternoon with the typical iPhone ""O sh...t, the frigg...n battery is dead !!"" situation. Shame though, that Blackberry decided to keep the battery out of reach, à la iPhone. Watch out for some apps which haven't yet been worked out properly on this device, like Skype; leaving Skype on even in the background will suck Your battery dry in a few hours.The only reason I haven't given this device a 5-star review, is that it started ""rebooting"" on me for no reason; the last time a few days ago, it would try to reboot but would simply not be able to do so... I ended up doing a factory reset and reinstalling the entire SW (USB cable linked to the Mac and the Link app; thank goodness for having a recent full backup); even after this, it took several reboot attempts to work again; I've been testing it for the past 3 days and so far so good (it now reboots and seems to be OK).

A simple but really crafty phone.,"I have had the BB Passport since yesterday, and I love it. My previous phone was a Samsung Galaxy note 3 and I don't regret replacing it with the Passport. Both phones are big but the Note is taller then the BB and the BB is wider. With my small hands, it should be a problem but it isn't. It makes me more careful picking it up, and a less chance for dropping it on the floor. What I also love about the Passport it its keyboard. It makes it a lot easier to write with, and faster. I never handle the writing on glass on my previous smartphones that well. The phone is in many ways also simpler to use then the Note. Some would say it miss some features, but not in my case. The phones in comparison have a long lasting battery use. So there is not much to say about that. Only that both phones can go on for at least one and a half day, maybe even more. The speed of the phone is also remarkable, compared to the Note 3, my guess would be twice as fast.The only minus for me would be the app stores on it. None of them have applications related to my home country, Denmark.Nevertheless, I will still give it 5 starts for the phone it self.",2015年1月3日 在美国审核

As far as apps go, I don't see this as a phone issue so I wont rate the phone for it. Further, the unit came with all the basics like LinkedIn, Facebook, twitter, and I downloaded instagram. I would have liked to have had my banking app but they are still working on it; again, this is not a phone issue. The phone is loud and call quality is great.I have small hands; but, the phone still feels good to hold and use.

Battery life: 1.5+ days for average usage, &gt;1 day for heavy usage. In stanby, the phone consumes ~1, 1.5% battery per hour.2. Touch keyboard: select words, move cursor in paragraph, scroll pages etc, very easy even if you have big fingers3. Screen: At lowest brightness, you can see clearly under the sun. My previous Lumia 920 cannot do that.4. Hub system: Integrate all emails, messages, notifications etc, well organized. You can access a new email very fast.5. Email: When my PC cannot access gmail due to slow connection, I can still access gmail from my Passport. I pick up my Passport, search for the mail I need, download the pictures from my bosses, pack them into a PDF file, then send it to my bosses. Everything is on the device.What I think the device is lacking:1. Mobile Office from Microsoft: The native Doc-to-go is not good enough in handling file, the format is usually distorted. I miss the pleasure using Mobile Word on my Lumia 920, no lag, no distortion. Hope that Microsoft will bring the experience to Blackberry.2. OneNote: Eventhough I have Evernote, I still like OneNote because most of my important notes are sync with my Live account. I don't want to scatter my notes elsewhere. OneNote is simple, easy to use yet powerful.3. Here Maps: Here Maps on Windows Phone is powerful. You can download the map of a whole country, set up your own collection of favorite places, sync with your Here account. The Here Map Beta version on Android is not that great.

I'd like to present the view of a Business Customer,"Instead of reiterating the positive findings of other Passport Silver owners, I'd like to present the view of a Business Customer. 2,5 half years ago our company decided to sort out Blackberrys (the employees were very happy with BB), and iPhone and Samsung S5 (later S6) have been introduced instead of BB. Now---as a Christmas gift---BYOD has been introduced and I changed immediately to BB Passport Silver. So after 2,5 years I have some basis for comparison to iPhone/Samsung. Summarizing first the usability, BB Passport would be a real redemption after the lifestyle gadgets like iPhone/S5/S6. The most important advanteges of BB Passport compared to the highly overhyped (and highly overpriced) lifestyle gadgets:---First I have 5-10 telcos per day. A common feedback from other telco participants was, that the speech quality on the other side (if I was over iPhone/S5-6 in the telco) was really miserable. Over BB Passport would be now the perception, if I would stay next to the other participants. We should also not forget, that telephony would be one of the most basic services of a mobile phone. Here BB Passport would have at least 2-3 stars advantage.---I have 3-6 WeBeX conferences per day. BB Passport would be WebEx capable, iPhone/S5-S6 not. 3 stars advantage for BB Passport---Usability: The usability of OS 10 would be in another weight-class compared to the lifestyle gadgets. 2 stars advantage.for Passport---Synchronisation with Outlook: I have at least 50 e-mails per day (sometimes 100+), and my business is strongly dependent on reliable E-Mail communication. In case of lifestyle gadgets I had 1-2 times loss of synchronisation with my Outlookper month on the average combined with loss of my data. During my experiences (4+ years) with different BBs, I have never had such a challenge. It should be also mentioned, that an app ""Mobile Iron"" was used for the synchronisation with Outlook. BB doesn't need a separate app and the synchronisation is definitely much more reliable than usingMobile Iron.---I need about 15 apps for my business, and all of these apps would be available for BB Passport. According to our company policy, it is not allowed to use WhatsApp and similar things for business communication (this would be OK, because the business infos are confidential), so I don't need such goodies.---13 Mpixel camera is more than enough for business purposes (to take photos from flipcharts, sometimes from groups, etc.). For high quality photos (eg., flowers, animals, etc.) I have an excellent photo device with the necessary objectives and lens.---I don't have games on my business smartphone: Gaming doesn't belong to our business and anyway, I don't have time for games.---Highly increased security risks with iOS and Android---The receiver of BB Passport is much better than the receiver of iPhone/S5/S6. I could use BB on places (for example in concrete buildings of a university), where there was no any connection using iPhone/S5/S6. Additionally I am a frequent traveller on the German high-speed train ICE (250-300 km/hour). Using BB Passport I have no any communication problem. The lifestyle gadgets could be used only punctual and restricted for communication.---There are a lot of other small things, too. For example, I must read e-mails also on the street. If there is some sunlight, it is almost impossible to read text on S5/S6, but there are also such challenges with iPhone. I had to look always for some shadow. Using BB Passport I don't have this problem.And some words on the purchase through Amazon US. I purchased my Passport Silver from Germany and use the device in Germany (T-Mobile). The delivery and custom administration were perfect. The Passport Silver is a real eye catcher and I am asked regularly if where could be purchased such a ""beautiful"" device. I am very happy with it, and I hope that Blackberry will not give up producing smartphones with keyboard. Another story from Germany. Samsung has provided the German government and the goverment offices with S5 and S6 practically free. However, after less than one month most of the employees wanted BB back (and they have received BB back).... After 2,5 years struggle with iPhone and S5/S6 I can fully understand this position.",2016年12月28日 在美国审核

"For children and young adults that's fine, the design language must cater to the immediacy ...","It's difficult for most people to accept but a phone without a keyboard is crippled by design.It can only aspire to be a tool for productive work and is more apt to be another device for consumption or distraction,.For children and young adults that's fine, the design language must cater to the immediacy that only simple UIs using touch alone can bring.This phone can certainly be used as a consumption device (video,audio, books, games) but shines as a productivity device (complex tasks using the kind of subtle and sometimes drawn out communication only afull keyboard can facilitate).This makes its design superior as it covers more use-cases out of the box.That lack of compromise and insistence of practicality is a sign of a more of an adult device.Now let's settle the question of apps once and for all. Apps are ephemeral, because the issues that spawned them (poor ui and lack of input choice (ie: touch-only)) are ephemeral.Did I lose you dear reader?Think on this then: what specifically is the need for a mobile app that a web-app cannot meet? Stated another way, why does every internet company need to develop one app for a computer and another for *each* mobile device platform and consequently manage multiple code-bases forever?There is no need to repeat the VHS/Betamax, BluRay/HDDVD holy war where only the consumer loses and developers are becoming more aware of this and creating websites that look and perform identically regardless of screen-size (See Twitter's Ratchet css library for details) using a single code base.So then using a phone with sufficient screen size and a sufficient input device needs nothing more than a decent browser. Need to uber? Use the website it looks great.Rinse, repeat with any other app you love so dearly.Many of you might be thinking, well that's nice and in 5 years I'll be sure to check up on that but I need android app X *now*.Well great news, the preloaded Amazon App Store on this phone has you covered. Go to town.Side-loading android apps will only get better on BB10 as time goes on.I just can't rave enough about what its like to have a screen this good or a full keyboard or most important the Blackberry OS and in particular BlackBerry Hub (all your account notifications at a glance organized and color coded).So what can I say critically of this device then:1] The camera has issues with face detection and thus auto-focusing takes too long.Easy remedy, tap the spot on the screen where you want it to focus or buy the Camera++ app on BlackBerry world for $2.Software updates have slowly improved this as time has gone on and will continue to do so.2]The browser doesn't come with an ad-blocker and I don't feel comfortable trusting a third party app to replace the native browser for just that feature.3]The voice assistant isn't as good as Siri. That's machine learning magic that will require BB to invest or acquire another company with that expertise.No regrets.",2016年1月17日 在美国审核

Great consumer phone with lightning-fast browser and beautiful keyboard,"Although I liked handling and using this phone for personal emails, browsing, and music, I think it should be said that this does not feel like a business phone as previous Blackberry generationshave been. I think this phone is an espeically good idea because Android and iPhone may havetaken over in market share but a phone with BOTH a strong browser and well-designedphysical keyboard has been sorely missing!THE GOOD-This keyboard is an improvement over older generations as it has largerbuttons and better spacing (found it to easier to type on than a 9900 andvirtual keyboard S5). Why I love a qwerty keyboard: other phones withvirtual keyboards make communicating like speaking to someone with atoothbrush in your mouth; you can do it and they can understand, but wowis awkward -- this keyboard gives you your voice back!-And mixed with its lightning-fast browser (better than my Samsung Galaxy S5 on T-Mobile),universal inbox for texts, emails, social feeds, and Amazon Appstore forAndroid, this phone felt nicely refreshing over my Android for many uses.THE BAD-This is more a business complaint than anything else but thecopy-and-paste, even with keyboard's ""trackpad,"" is the same as on any Android or iPhone; which is to say clunky and without precision. Selecting cutting/copying points and thenpasting points was 60% accurate (same as my S5, and especially problematic on corners of the screen). In fact, the select function in which you press an on-screen button to begin selection became regularly confused when I swiped left (to begin slecting my text) and swiping left on the keyboard also happens be the the delete function!. Additonally the trackpad did not quickly and easily jump from input field to input field for me (there was a lot of unpredictable and necessary thumb intervention)-Amazon MP3 store is great (an adequate contender to Google music) and prime offerings got me alittle giddy; that being said I'm unsure about the Passport's Chromecastabilities (there's a well-rated Chromecast app available for a very smallfee btw).-One downside is that this is -not- a business phone; I -love- my 9900 andfor the Passport being ""designed for creation &amp; input"" as the manualstates, I was expecting a business phone, along with some of thatBlackberry business magic; high-volume communications seems to need a trackpad to quickly move to and typeanywhere, and a precision copy/cut-and-paste function, this phone wasclearly made to be for personal use - and for this reason, I actually returned it after I realized it had little value for my company.That being said, this was a huge step up from my Samsung S5 in terms of quick, easy input, consolidated messaging, and high-speed performance, so I -do- like this phone because it accomplishes being a good -personal- phone.",2014年10月16日 在美国审核

"excellent audio, great battery life, looking forward to updates and more native apps",I am writing this review on the Passport.I have paired it with shure 535 and 128gb SD card for audio. Best and richest sound quality I have heard on my Shure's so far. Definitely the best audio quality on a phone I have ever heard.Messaging is easy and intuitive. The keyboard does get some getting used to. Frankly a touch screen would of been a quicker learn but I am only ten days in with the passport so it should get better.Some cons... like the reviews have noted the app selection is very weak on the blackberry store. It is one thing to have low number of apps but BlackBerry eco is full of misleading and useless apps. The amazon app store is a good step forward but these apps drain battery and make the phone run hot.The OS is generally smooth but does have some bugginess from time to time.Battery life is the real deal. I do not worry about chargers anymore.Overall a excellent phone that needs a few small tweeks. A touch screen option with the same form factor and battery life may be the perfect phone.,2014年11月9日 在美国审核

"Works decently, but lots of technical issues when trying to use google based android apps","I like the phone, but google app integration is pretty flaky. Most of the apps seem to work fine unless they require google services, and I spent a lot of time trying to get some to work properly to mixed results. Most importantly, blackberry maps doesn't have very good listings when searching for businesses. So I was able to get google maps to work somewhat decently after hours of trial and error installing google backend stuff from crackberry. Lots of ""google services have stopped"" pop-ups when using maps, but it's workable. Also no go on getting hangouts to work, or tango, which I had unfortunately gotten used to using a lot lately before getting the passport. As far as I can tell, there are no decent video chat options I can reasonably expect friends or family to use to communicate with me on the passport.<br>The phone would be great if they could make nice with google and get some official support on making google services run on devices well, should the user choose to lose some battery life in return.I was hoping, since most unlocked phones on T-mobile don't have tethering restrictions, that I wouldn't get capped at 5gb on my unlimited plan, but unfortunately I just hit that cap. I read somewhere that the blackberry wouldn't be able to have tethering restrictions on t-mobile since it doesn't use any t-mobile bloatware, but unfortunately blackberry sends the information to them through some other means. This is kind of a deal breaker for me, and I'm going to spend several more hours trying to figure out a workaround, but with the limited support in the crackberry community for t-mobile, I doubt I'll make any progress.</br>",2015年5月27日 在美国审核

Slightly dated but different,"The passport software is slightly dated in my opinion. But the passport shows its original roots from years ago which isn't a bad thing. The iphone shows its roots too. Same screen layout and features. I don't count the silly NFC because I think that's pointless. The passport has excellent battery life which I love! I will admit I type much slower on the physical keyboard on the passport than my iphones and note 4. I value my privacy and security so I only use the passport for calling,texting and emailing from primary account. I could careless about the apps not being around for passport. I utilize the Note 4 for apps,games and other email accounts. I'm shocked at the permissions apps ask for! Insane! That's why I use the Note 4 for everything else. (I use note4 over the passport wifi hotspot) Sure it could be silly carrying two phones but that's my thing and it works for me. I will also say this I've been an iphone user since 08 and I have no regrets leaving iphone for the passport as primary phone. The keyboard having a touch track pad feature is awesome!! It helps you not hit the wrong thing on screen or accidentally click on pesky advertisements. The swipe up feature is neat and definitely helps cut down on typing some words.I recommend the blackberry for email and texting and of course calling! Excellent voice quality.I forgot to review internet browsing. Definitely much better experience on the internet using the passport. Sure the mobile sites on the note 4 is bigger than iphone but passport takes the cake due to it having mostly the capabilities of telling a site it's a desktop and the width of screen helps view pages with ease.",2015年1月31日 在美国审核

It's alright,"To write this review is disappointing for me because I wanted this phone ever since it came out and now that I have it I don't like it. I use to have a blackberry classic in High School and loved it but this is nothing alike. here are some of the conscons:- phone will drop service sometimes randomly, and will say no service even after you take out the sim and re install it back.- screen will lag sometimes or won't respond to touch.- majority of the apps they say will work on the app store DOES NOT work and if it does let you install it, once you open the app it will say error or will keep force closing. i.e [LYFT, UBER, FACEBOOK ETC doesn't Work]even the LITE versions doesn't work. The ONLY App that Works on this phone is WhatsApp which is surprising for me that it did work.- the phone will overheat sometimes randomly out of nowhere and nothing will be running in the background nor is my environment hot. it's weird.- Camera &amp; Video quality SUCKS BAD, just stick to Iphone- when transferring pictures from another phone to this phone, its either highly pixelated or extremely blurry and bad quality.- on previous blackberry devices you use to be able to change the color of the blinking LED Notification, you cannot do it on this phone unless you are setting a notification for a specific contact.- The Picture Pattern unlock is terrible and is not accurate. trying to unlock your phone will have you locked out of your phone. Lol I had to change my pattern picture unlock to a regular pin code because of this issue.- Sometimes Texts/Calls don't come in if the phone is positioned towards the wall which is CRAZY and the area I live in does not have a low signal because my iphone works perfectly fine in the exact same position, it's only this phone that does it.- A lot of websites are not compatible so I have to either use a computer or use my Iphone, which defeats the purpose since this phone is suppose to show websites fully without having to scroll to the sides.Pros:- Blackberry Hub joins all of your notifications into one place- Speaker is super loud- Blinking light for notifications so you know when you have a new text message/call-Qwerty Keyboard &amp; SwipeAll in All, this phone was really a waste of money and I will be switching back to my Iphone. it's just not worth it and if you're someone who is switching from an iphone to this, I wouldn't do it, you will regret it. you are losing app capability, camera/video and all of the other neat things you can do with your iphone like typing up word documents and edit &amp; sign for adobe reader, all of which is not available on this phone. This phone was suppose to be marketed toward business people andit lacks on everything in every single aspect when it comes to business. I literally would only buy this phone for International use and if you plan on using WhatsApp majority of the time or if you just want a phone just to call and text. I would've returned it but the return date already passed. Just giving a heads up for people who plan on buying this worthless phone. Please don't make the same mistake I did.",2019年6月5日 在美国审核

loving my Passport,"Once you get past it's initially strange (ie. unusual) appearance, you'll find that it's a beautiful phone with a gorgeous screen and top-notch build quality. The specs are also top of the line, and the huge battery lasts between 24-48 hours, depending on how heavily you use it. Its a nice change of pace to be able to get up at 6 am, use the phone as much as I do, and still have 20, 30 or even 40% of your battery left when you put it on the charge at 11 pm. I use my phone a lot for many different things, from streaming music to emails and texts to phone calls and the occasional game. When it comes to battery life, all I can say is If you need to charge this phone during the day, then you simply do not stop using your phone for five minutes.The OS, quad core processor and 3 GBs of RAM allow you to multi-task with ease. And that strange (different) square screen is incredibly crisp and allows you to see so much more than traditional rectangles do. While it may have been designed with spreadsheets and documents in mind, check out an email, web page, even apps and you will quickly know what I'm talking about. No more zoom and scrolling left and right to see things. No more cramped mobile web-style of looking at things. It's just all there, easily viewable. It's the first time I haven't minded reading longer emails or web pages on a phone.The form factor does take some getting used to though. Anyone that claims you can effectively use the phone one-handed is also, in my opinion, not accurate. It is a big phone, particularly in width, and two hands are needed with pretty much any task that requires typing. The same can be said of many if not most new phones these days, with 5+"" screens becoming the norm. However, using a phone two-handed is no big deal to me, as anything that keeps me from texting while driving or walking on a city sidewalk is actually a good thing in my book. Things that do not require typing (checking weather app, calendar, reading your messages) can for the most part still be done one-handed.And the keyboard.....a three row physical qwerty for letters with adaptive on-screen virtual keys for everything else. No, it's not the virtual keyboard, or even physical keyboard that everyone is used to, and does take a little while to get proficient with. Once you do, you will find it to be incredibly smart and innovative. The physical keyboard also acts as a trackpad, allowing you to scroll, navigate, erase and edit words, and much more without ever having to touch the screen. These are not the 'oooh' and 'ahhh' novelties that some are coming up with; they are new ways of doing things that are actually quite useful. It seems as if BlackBerry is the only player doing anything outside the box these days.I have a PC and an ipad, and have had many iPhones and Android devices in my life. Any claims that BB10 has a significant learning curve are grossly overstated. I think what they really mean is it's not Windows, Apple or Android, so they're not used to it. While you will be discovering new tricks and tools every day for months, it really only takes about fifteen minutes to understand and be able to navigate around a BB10 phone. Within a few days at most, you'll find that it's an extremely efficient and actually very intuitive OS that works well and just makes sense. Anyone familiar with BlackBerry 10 OS will appreciate how incredibly useful the hub is, and everything about this phone works very fast and very well. Swiping instead of using physical home and back buttons makes a lot of sense once you use it for a few days. When I pick up my ipad, I constantly find myself taking certain actions or making certain gestures, only to realize they don't work, and I regularly find myself wondering why Apple and Android haven't done things a certain way. You will find yourself doing the same thing. Also, for those that heard BB10 was a lesser operating system, it seems that when it was first released at the beginning of 2013, it was. However, the OS has had four major updates in the past eighteen months (ios and android usually get one major update per year), and compared to at launch, it now feels like a complete, mature operating system.Out of the box, this phone (and other BB10 phones) offers as much or more functionality than pretty much any other phone out there. The file manager is an incredibly useful tool, so much so that I cannot understand why everyone doesn't have one. I can also use it. Among many other things, it allows me to access every file on my phone and also with my PC or Mac computers. BlackBerry Blend allows you to securely access the calendar, contacts and messages on your BlackBerry from your PC, Mac, ios or android device (like Apple does, but cross platform), which is very helpful. Both the file manager and Blend work whether your phone is on a wifi or mobile network. I can be half way across the globe, and I can access my computer. I could forget my phone at home, and my computer or tablet can access its contents. No third-party apps: these just work out of the box. Pretty nice.If apps are important to you, the Passport comes with BlackBerry World apps and the Amazon App Store preloaded, and a one-time side loading (rather easy to do) of Snap gets you access to the Google Play Store, which work extremely well. Anyone who says that BlackBerry is missing apps doesn't know what they're talking about. Oh, and the reception and call quality are fantastic, as is the speakerphone quality. To me, this is very important. It is a phone, right?I am not a fanboy. I own and have owned BlackBerry, Apple, Android, Mac and PC products. If you are willing to try something different, if you value quality products, if you value productivity, I would highly recommend the BlackBerry Passport. This is the best phone I have ever owned, period.",2014年11月8日 在美国审核

Finally A Phone That Feels Like It Was Built Just For Me,"I consider myself one of the lucky ones who was able to purchase a Passport from Amazon on launch day before it sold out. I was considering a few phones, but this one caught my eye and eventually my imagination.After almost two weeks I have to say that I am totally thrilled that I went with the Passport over those other cookie-cutter phones on the two-company marketThe first thing you notice is the build. It is definitely a premium quality device. And it is large, but not as large in your hand as you thought it would be. Actually, most things I can still get away with only using one hand (ie. surfing the web, watching YouTube videos, sending short texts, etc.), while any texts or emails longer than a few words usually takes both hands. And It fits just fine in my jacket pocket. I happen to be one of those people who does not put any cellphone in my pant pockets.The screen is awesome. It is a joy to surf the web on a phone without having to constantly be tilting it back and forth. The same goes for emails, texts, documents, etc. Videos are crystal clear and vivid, but you do not get the same amount of screen real estate for videos that you would with other phones that are tilted in landscape mode.My only real concern before purchasing was the keyboard. As someone who has never used a hardware keyboard, I wasn't sure I could adapt after the virtual keyboards on my previous phones. I needn't have worried. After a couple of days, I can honestly say that I have never typed faster or more accurately than on the Passport. The word suggestions are awesome, and as the device gets used to the words you often use, you find yourself typing alot less and instead swiping up complete words alot more. Sometimes it only takes me 6 or 7 pushes on the keys to write a 20 or 30 word sentence, as the keyboard lets me swipe more than type. The swipe-sensitive keyboard also allows you to scroll though webpages, emails, and documents without having to swipe on the screen. I must say that I really appreciate the thought and innovation that went into this device.The battery is incredible. Although I'm not a ""business"" type (just a regular blue-collar guy), I do consider myself a heavy user, and my phone lasts the entire day and then some. On heavier use days the battery will last a good 18 hours, while on lighter use days I get at least 24 hours. I used to plug my phone in as soon as I got home, but now I just plug it in before I go to sleep (and it still usually has a 25% of the battery left).As everybody knows, Blackberry doesn't have anything close to the app selection of Android and Apple, but this wasn't a big concern to me. The apps that I actually do use are either already available through Blackberry, or I can download them via Amazon, 1MobileMarket, Snap, or other sites that let you sideload. Whether it's Netflix, my football team's app, my banking app, or games like Pacman, I have them all on my Passport, and they all work great.I really love the multitasking you can do with this phone. When they say you can have up to eight active screens going at the same time, they aren't kidding. You simply never have to close a screen or an app in order to open up another one.If you have several apps that you use to communicate with people, then the Hub is a feature that will completely change the way you look at your phone. It lets you receive all your communications in one place, and respond to all of them, without the necessity of having to leave the Hub, and go separately into each app or email or text or whatever, in order to respond. Simply brilliant. I have several email accounts, Facebook, Twitter, texts, and phone calls all set in the Hub, and it sure makes my ability to respond a breeze.Blackberry Blend is also a great feature that lets you sync you laptop or tablet to the Passport so that you can access the communications on your phone on those other devices. I've got a laptop and it works perfectly. Again, it is very simple and easy to use innovative feature of this phone.The OS on the Passport is very nice. It is simple, appealing, effective, and super fast. I guess the non-Android OS, along with the 3 MB of Ram under the hood, is the reason I have yet to notice any lags on this device at all.I haven't used the camera too much, but the shots I have taken have been very nice, and I hope to start using some of it's other features (like panoramic mode) very soon.The sound on this device is top notch. I have a 64 GB SD card with a 4,000 song library on my phone and the speakers on the Passport blow away my friends' Apple and Android phones . The speaker phone is also top of the line - clear and crisp.As icing on the cake, the mini-HDMI port lets me watch Netflix or YouTube videos, or anything really, on my TV screenI guess the bottom line is this: If you are looking for a phone that lets you do things quickly, innovatively, and effortlessly, and don't mind using two hands most of the time, then the Passport just might be the phone for you. On the other hand, if you simply must use only one hand, must watch videos in landscape mode, absolutely need to put you phone in your skinny jeans, or are addicted to plugging in your phone more than once during the day, then this phone just might not be for you.",2014年10月13日 在美国审核
I love the machine,"I love the machine, mostly because its OS support Android Apps, and the response is fast enough.The keyboard though, is quite a disappointment. The wired-arranged keys really deters the typing speed, and is very very very uncomfortable.",2015年3月2日 在美国审核
Good Phone,"I've only had Blackberry phones for the last Thirteen Years (13) so I know no other. My passport wouldn't charge after a month of using the phone. I couldn't figure out the problem but I also realized that the phone charger that came with the phone was getting way too hot when the phone was being charged, so I thought to change the charger.

It’s my favourite BB ever Pockets,"Disclaimer: I'm bias towards BlackBerry.History: iPhone 1st Gen → Curve 9300 → Z10 → PassportTL;DR: It’s my favourite BB everPockets:I usually wear normal sized jeans or basketball shorts. I haven’t had an issue of the phone getting in or out of my pocket with my hands. However, the device does tend to slip out of MY shallow pockets when sitting down in MY car.One Hand:I'm 5’8 with normal sized hands as far as I’m aware. It’s impossible to type a sentence with one hand. However, I found that the only thing I wanted to do with one hand was changing the song, or browsing Instagram, Twitter, Vine, etc… I did not feel limited by my inability to type meaningful messages with one hand.With the new BB assistant, you simply talk to the phone and it will type whatever you want, better then you could EVER type with one hand. All you have to do is press the little “period” aka “.” button on the virtual keyboard and start talking. It works anywhere you can type.Screen:It’s basically what you would expect it to be. This isn't a complaint, but you cannot get a whole Instagram picture in view. Even though Instagram pictures are square, the web app (and Android app) has headers &amp; footers which obstruct the full view of the image.Keyboard:A BB physical keyboard is by far the superior typing experience for accuracy. I felt myself less “lazy” to respond to texts and emails from the phone. It’s also nice not having to wait for the keyboard to popup.The keyboard took me about 2 days to fluently type with.I have no issue with the “extended” virtual keyboard, but I hate the lack of “old skool"" short cuts. The number pad is awkward to use, as I miss typed numbers several times. I felt myself wanting to use the double quote, comma, and number pad quite frequently, which are only located on the virtual keyboard. I actually l love the idea of the special characters on a virtual keyboard. But, it’s unfavourable to use the virtual keyboard for basic punctuation. I want the short cuts BACK! I think you should be able to hold down “Z” as a shift button.On a side note, If you double space, it will automatically place a period down. (Unless you’re typing an email address)Apps:I’m not an app whore. I’ve been using the Z10 since it was released, I’m very aware of the limited amount of BB10 apps. However, I wasn't impressed when a couple of my favourite apps were “not supported” from the Blackberry World. One in particular is the official NFL app.Android Apps are noticeably faster.Blend:I couldn't get Blend to work on Windows 8 for some reason. Admittedly, didn't try very hard, but I couldn't get it to work using the USB cable or WiFi. On the contrary I was able to get Blend working with the iPad. I haven’t used Blend ONCE since I installed it. It’s not very responsive and has limited use for now. The only time I can see myself using Blend, is to check my email, and my phone is in another room. I’m not a hater, I see a lot of potential for it.I’m a Linux user, and I don’t understand why Blend cannot be a “web app” / “cloud app”. I want to be able to use Blend within a Linux environment, as well as my ChomeOS laptop.",2014年10月21日 在美国审核

That's the worst part. -A minor part is that the camera,"I have deliberated over 3 months before finally taking the plunge i.e., giving up my iPhone 4S for BB Passport (over the other obvious option to upgrade to iPhone 6). The main reason was the fact that I knew I would be left wanting for some of the common apps in the iPhone ecosystem that I am so used to in my busy life. But, at the end I couldn't resist the temptation of going back to BB (I have always been a BB user before iPhone). So now, I am learning to live without those (like for example, some common banking apps, Medscape app, transit apps, etc). That's the worst part.-A minor part is that the camera, although takes fantastic images and has a lot of post processing abilities, is slower than iphone and others (takes time to focus)Now, everything else is just better that iPhone, and a lot has been written about it. So I am not going to reinvent the wheel. Briefly, the web browser, Hub, adobe and the ability to edit PDFs and even social media apps are all fantastic. The form factor gets me a curious--&gt; cool--&gt; smile look every time. Funny, howmany times a day I get asked- "" is that a blackberry? I thought they don't make phones anymore?"". The odd square shape is actually strikingly beautifully although it takes a good week or so to get used to holding it and using the keyboard with ease.One key issue that REALLY UPSET me was (no its not the lack of a few key apps) that yahoo mail DOES NOT PUSH instantaneously anymore like before (when I used to have the old BB). Gmail and Exchange/Outlook servers push instantly (just like in iPhone). This has got nothing to do with the BB Passport itself but the way Yahoo delivers and support its email + the fact that BB does not have is internal server anymore. So in essence BlackBerry has lost its instant push email functionality which was THE thing about BB in the past. Sad.",2015年3月28日 在美国审核

Makes gestures and navigating much nicer.The keyboard is simple enough to get the hang of, especially if you've used BlackBerry in the past. I'm amazed after switching back to a physical keyboard, I still have all my typing skills from years before. Only learning curve is I'm tapping the ""z"" expecting the ""alt"". In fact, I'm writing this review on my Passport.Won't go on discussing all the same talking points as everyone else. I will simply end this review with this final thought:Screw every other phone before this (BlackBerry, Android, iPhone). THIS is it. The Passport's screen, battery, quality, security, speakers, &amp; call quality actually do something BETTER for the user.

I've had the Passport since 12/28/14 and prior had the Q10, Torch, and Bold, etc. I made a list and here is goes:PROS1. Square screen for reading webpages and email2. QWERTY keyboard3. Ability to add micro SD card4. Enclosed battery5. Ideal for people who like to organize stuff like menus and gym schedules, etc.6. New relationship with Amazon App Store7. Design and sturdiness8. Possible decrease in EMF's due to wanting to use ear buds instead putting phone to ear9. 30 day free technical help upon purchaseCONS1. square shape affecting portability (comfortable but awkward)2. Lack of accessories (someone needs to design something to make this thing wearable)3. My kid teases me by asking, ""why am I carrying my IPad?""4. Zero in left corner on virtual keyboard instead of bottom (I keep tracking to the old location)The virtual numerical keypad is bad. It's like BB is training us for no keyboard phones. I stuck with BB for the QWERTY. I feel like I'm being weaned off QWERTY against my will. Today I decided to remove the case with the cardholder that I bought for this phone. The case makes the phone feel bulky and cumbersome. I'm concerned I'm going to put it down and leave it somewhere due to its size. Where going ""naked"" means it feels better in your hand and fits better in your pocket. The exterior shell could be considered flawless.I'm impressed with the speed of the OS and the life of the battery.

Fun device as a spare/backup.,"For me, the Passport was more of a must have to play with it type of phone. While I loved how different it was and looked, it was clearly not as functional as I needed and wanted it to be plus my hands are large and the keys are just too small still for me. It can be said that it's not BlackBerry's fault for app companies to not support this device but at the same time it can be said that BlackBerry didn't have to make such a unique device that made certain apps visually unappealing. If you have the money to throw around, love BB or don't need app support from certain apps and had a second/primary phone then I would totally recommend giving into your curiosity over this phone. Again, for me I needed certain support from a few apps that just didn't work on this phone and couldn't rely on this as my only daily device.",2016年1月9日 在美国审核

"I TRIED, I REALLY TRIED!! (:","I tried Blackberry twice before and was hoping that there was some progress made in their product and I REALLY wanted to like the Passpport but it seems that Blackberry has left OS10 out in the cold for Android as proof in their latest phone, the all-Android Priv.Their mapping software is lacking here in California, I was in a major city in so Cal and it didn't even draw up the street names. You have to pay for a decent Facebook app, and thats still a work in progress.AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS AT BLACKBERRY MARKET! I wanted this phone because of security, and I have been made Western States Regional Sales Manager for a Jobsite Security Camera Company and being responsible for building a sales team, I wanted to use BES to protect company contacts, and the privacy issues that re always popping up in the news about Android and now Apples security being threatened by our own government. But this OS is really showing its age, and the BB Marketplace has a pitiful amount of app, but you can go to Amazon, and download from there. There are ways to run Google Play Store and all the Google apps with full functionality if you want to spend a weekend learning how to side-load programs, and stress about screwing something up.Hardware is impressive. Screen resolution is spectacular. The camera blows away my iPhone 5ss'. It has an SD slot etc the file transfer software works better than it did. They didn't even have a MAC version then, as I recall. Good stuff. Square screen different, But too different. The rest of the universe has gone to a rectangular screen, and even with the temptation of reading emails easily, landscape mode is fine on other devices.There is no ""Back"" button. Its all ""swipe"", or ""flick"" or ""fling"" the thing across the room because it won't go back to the home page without opening the ""hub"". Not good. I guess its showing the age of its design. two years ago. the app store at Blackberry was worse so.....For you die hard Blackberry guys and gals, you're in luck they are $400.00 cheaper than they were.So its back to paying though the nose for decent storage and get an iPhone, or deal with security issues with an Android device, and deal with protecting company client lists in some other way using a remote wi[e, or encrypt the lists to the SIM card and put a passcode on it, but I think you would still be able to copy it to an email or .vcf file.UPDATE**********Due to the unpleasant remarks by some readers, I deemed it necessary to update the ""No back button"" shortcut remark in my review.I have large hands. XL gloves or bigger. I cant hold the phone in one hand and get anywhere without a two handed swipe.",2016年2月22日 在美国审核

Ehh..,"It technically works. The flap does put the phone to sleep, and opening it does awake the phone. It looks nice when you first put in on, at least from the back. The front is not that great looking (though it's not bad, in my opinion), but that's not where my gripe with this case comes from.This case is not removal-friendly. As in, I removed this case once (to put in a new SIM), and cracks were already forming on the plastic corners. A part of the corner fell off today, and I've had this case for just over a week. Considering the fact that I will remove it again to put in an SD card, the life expectancy of this case can't be high. I've yet to even drop the phone despite my perpetual klutziness. So to summarize : this case is great and does what it's supposed to if you never have to take it off.",2016年8月23日 在美国审核

"This is a 5-star phone, but.........","Update #1 05 June 2015:Blackberry has finally made this right.The faulty phone has finally been replaced and the new phone appears to be working perfectly.It is an outstanding 5-star phone.It is unfortunate it took from 25 Feb 2015 until today (05 June 2015) to get me a fully-operational phone.The phone works the first time -- every time -- and does what it is supposed to.Finally -- the phone I've been wanting.And OBTW, Blackberry has indicated they have taken care of the FEDEX charges that were billed to me -- I believe them.<br>---------------------------------------------Original entry --I purchased this phone ~25 Feb 2015 from Amazon.When it arrived everything worked perfectly -- I loved the phone.But I noticed a small black ""dot"" on my photographs -- especially when I zoomed in (see attached photo).It turned out to be a small speck of dust in the lens.In only took a few days for Blackberry to replace the phone.So far, so good.The new phone that came in still doesn't work.Original Trouble-call was ~10 Apr 2015.It is now 22 May 2015 and I still don't have a phone that works.However, I have received a FEDEX bill for $89 for the return of the original phone.So -- six weeks after trouble call, I do not have an operational phone and I have an $89 bill from FEDEX.Symptoms of the new phone:1.Fails to automatically connect to bluetooth devices.2.Did not update outlook contacts when synchronized with computer.3.Internet access works ~50% of the time.Frequently gives a white screen of death or a black screen with a button that says ""Try again"".4.Phone gets hot when camera is used.5.Gives daily notices that ""Account info is needed"" -- when it's not.6.When I manually connect to Bluetooth (fails to connect automatically), frequently drops sync and sound like Darth Vader at both ends of the conversation.7.Failed to provide a ""Log report"" to the Blackberry technicians.After 6 weeks, it appears the folks at Blackberry have lost interest in assisting me.The cost of the phone added to the FEDEX bill is a lot of $$ for a phone that doesn't work.</br>",2015年5月22日 在美国审核

Meet the new King of Productivity: The BlackBerry Passport,"I ordered this phone on the day of release right after the Launch Event presentations blew me off my feet. I wanted to use it for at least a week before giving a review, to be as accurate as possible, and now I feel confident in saying that you can DEFINITELY believe the hype. This phone is the real deal! I am going WAY in depth with this review, trying to hit as many things as I can. (EDIT: Invoice link since some people are so quick to discredit reviews from non ""Verified Purchase"" users...even though I stated it was bought direct from shopblackberry. Purchase dated 9/24, review posted 10/3 after about a week of use. It was available for hours on shopblackberry before Amazon had it, so of course a lot of the first batch users did not purchase from Amazon which explains the few old Verified Purchase reviews.)http://i.imgur.com/53eyWMD.jpg**********First, the hardware:**********- Processor: Snapdragon 801, which is a tweaked 2.26ghz Quad core beast of a mobile processor, just like the one in the highly reviewed LG G3. Not that the super efficient QNX based BB10 OS needs that much horsepower, but it is nice to have. Apps open and close staggeringly fast, and the ""Peek and Flow"" gesture based OS is a joy to use with so much horsepower under the hood. I'll get to that later...- GPU: Adreno 330, clocked at 450mhz. This GPU from Qualcomm is roughly 50% faster then the previous mobile GPU standard. Again, a productivity machine like the Passport doesn't ""need"" so much graphical power...but it sure is nice to have! 3D games like the strangely addictive Hungry Shark run smooth as butter, and it has no problem pushing the over 2 million pixels in the 1440x1440 display.- RAM: 3GB. Yes, that is TRIPLE the memory of the iPhone 6 and a full Gigabyte more RAM then many high end phones. This allows true multi-tasking. Programs are not ""bookmarked"" when minimized, and multiple tabs in your browser are actual pages loaded in every tab - programs and browser tabs are not closed when you minimize them like the pseudo-multitasking most consumers are used to. This serves two benefits - not only are apps up and running in the background (allowing things like reply to messages without pausing videos or games), but your minimized apps open instantly. That is because apps were never closed - just tucked away into that massive 3GB memory pool. Add all that to the small footprint of the BB10 OS, which gives significantly more free RAM compared to an Android with the same physical memory, and you have a beast of a multitasker.-Battery: ~3500mAh monster of a battery. This is not a phone you charge every night as you tuck yourself into bed. The first day will suck a bit more juice then normal due to multiple accounts and settings syncing and ""settling in"". After that? You will be amazed. Easy 2 days of juice with ""normal"" use. I took mine off the charger this morning at 7AM. I keep bluetooth on, Pebble App synced and running, three different Email Accounts synced, a busy Twitter Feed, my Stock brokerage app, a Browser instance, and my Device Manager always running with 5 active tiles on screen. I check my phone often, and use it non-stop during my full 45 minute break and randomly throughout the day. I got home from work at 6PM with 72% battery. That is 28% in 11 hours of heavy use! That is around 40hrs(!) of battery life with of mixed use, well in line with the 30hours of ""heavy use"" promised.-Display: 1440x1440 IPS LCD. Again, this is the display tech of the beastly G3...but with a twist. The LCD has the benefit of not needing ""dark themes"" to save battery life like AMOLED screens do, and is nice and bright with great contrast. The real twist is of course the 1:1 aspect ratio. This phone gives a true DESKTOP EXPERIENCE. You will never want to view a mobile version of a website again. Text is crisp and easily visible even when zoomed way out, and even at the default half brightness your whites are nice and bright. Webpages, Calanders, Spreadsheets, PDFs, and Documents all look amazing, with tons of available screen real estate. For the first time, I am willing to not only view my documents (using the included stellar Documents to Go suite), but I can happily edit them as well. Which leads to the next part, which is probably what impresses people the most, the keyboard...-Keyboard: Full QWERTY with built-in trackpad. Yes, a full trackpad. I was expecting simple Left/Right/Up/Down swipe functions, but this is an actual laptop-esque trackpad. You can drag figure 8's across the keyboard and the screen responds appropriately. The first day of use I kept catching myself scrolling with my finger on the screen, before pleasantly remembering that I can use the keyboard as a great scrollbar for both horizontal and vertical scrolling. No more accidentally clicking hyperlinks when attempting to scroll a webpage or blocking your content with your own hands and finger. The keyboard is very wide, which takes some getting used to, and with only 3 rows context sensitive punctuation and symbols are delegated to the bottom row of the massive screen. This is a blessing and a curse - you get the slick virtual keyboard perks of BB10 like being able to swipe a physical keyboard to the left to delete your last word or swipe up to accept word suggestions, but adds another learning curve to get used to reaching UP for punctuation instead of down. Again, a few days into using the device you will wonder how you lived without it.-Misc: Speakers are brilliant. While made for Conference Call accuracy, I set it down to an HTC M8 display and loaded up the same music video on both devices. The M8 had a slightly higher volume ceiling, but the Passport quality was much better. Deeper, smoother sound is how I would describe it. Call quality is of course excellent, being one of the core Blackberry features to this day. At the local bar, I'm rocking 4 bars indoors where my buddies with the same carrier have 2-3. Calls are clear and easy to hear, thanks to the FOUR microphones that observe ambient noise and adjust volume levels on the fly. Camera is the best Blackberry has offered...but that is not saying much and while it does admirably in good lighting it is still not as good as other top tier phones in other situations like poor lighting. I feel this is most likely a software issue, since the specs are right up there with the best of them - 13MP Optical Image Stabilization with scene modes for HDR, Panoramic, low light, etc.**********Operating System:**********The phone ships with the new and improved BB10.3 OS. In this version, native .apk support is up and running, and it ships with Amazon Appstore. It seems currently a few core apps that I know for a fact are compatible with the OS since they run fine on my aging Z10 with the 10.3 leak are not showing up for the Passport still. I can only assume this is to optimize them for the display, since some apps do not scale properly and although the work fine look a bit wonky and are either stretched out or with tons of empty space :). Never fear though, since Play Store can be sideloaded easily through a front end called Snap, allowing full Google Play Store access. Of course this is not officially supported by Blackberry, but I have found a resounding majority of apps will run fine when installed from snap. With Blackberry World, Amazon Market, and Play Store through Snap you should be able to find whatever you need.With the small footprint and efficiency of the QNX based BB10 OS paired with the high end hardware of the Passport, of course the OS is shockingly fast and snappy. Apps open and close nearly instantly - not that you need to close them with all that free RAM - and menus and actions all respond accordingly. The Peek and Flow OS is a joy to use on such a large screen, and it makes you wonder how you got around clumsy menu based OS's like Android...and I pray to the Diety of your choice you don't have to use a home button based iPhone after BB10. It is an exercise in frustration...Overall, if productivity is your goal and you spend more time posting on Forums, writing Emails, or viewing documents and spreadsheets then you do throwing birds across your screen or matching candies, I have a hard time thinking of a better workhorse then the Passport.********Conclusion:**********Cons:- Learning curve. Keyboard and Gesture based OS take a couple days to get used to.- 100% of all apps may not work. With three different App storefronts this is not as big a deal as it used to, but still worth mentioning.- Size may be an issue to some - notably those with small hands and 1 handed texters...oh, and those with Skinny Jeans :). Fits just fine in all my Slacks, Khakis, and Jeans.- Camera low/poor light performance leaves something to be desired, and focus is slow (true at time of the review, focus issue is mostly remedied with new OS update)Pros:EVERYTHING ELSE. Seriously, the phone is a joy to use. Screen, Keyboard, Battery life, Call quality, etc are all stellar.Don't be afraid to try something different - give it a week or so to get used to the ""culture shock"" then see if you can go back to the crowd of identical handsets. I know I can't.",2014年10月4日 在美国审核

Blackberry Has Delivered a Truly Revolutionary Device,"I have had the Passport for about a week and I am superimpressed with this phone (machine). I am using this along with the Blackberry Classic. The new BB10 update on the Classic provides even greater access and compatibility with android apps and when that is pushed to the Passport it will be even greater. The following is my review of the Classic which I posted on Amazon. Most applies to the Passport as well.I get it. Phones are a personal choice and there are tons to choose from. People are very passionate with their opinions about which OS is the best. I think each one has lots to like. Over the last month I have decided to get back into bed with BlackBerry. I was a die-hard fan up to the pearl and said I would never leave. Well I did and became an android fanatic big time. I owned them all starting with the Incredible, bionic, 3 Nexus, 2 Notes, Thunderbolt, and both Moto X devices. Switched one time to BlackBerry back in 2011 for 1 day and hated the phone as it was so slow. I was done forever! I had some free time and started reading about Blackberry again and decided to check out the Z30. For $225 I could not go wrong. I was super impressed. The horribly slow phone I was expecting was really good. I read about the lack of apps. Not true. Amazon App store was good but I wanted more so I found an app called SNAP and had access to all the apps I used which are mostly financial ones and Google music. Some apps that require play services were not 100% compatible but worked.Today the classic arrived and yes it will remind you of the classic blackberries you loved but it is now caught up with the times. This phone has a premium feel to it and has some heft which only adds to the quality feel. I have also found with the new 10.3.1.1154 update that some android apps I often use like Netflix and HP Print All In One remote are now fully functional. Netflix will now cast to my Samsung smart tv's and hp remote now allows me to print to my wireless printer and utilizes the scan function. The scanning is key for my business as I can scan docs directly to my phone!!! Internet browsing is speedy. I have compared this side by side with my passport and my wife's iphone. Browsing with the Passport is a tad faster and is equal to the iphone as far as uploading websites. I also use Microsoft's wireless display adapter which works flawlessly with my Blackberry phones. No more hooking up cables to my TV or projector. I just cast my screen to them both and can watch/listen to whatever is on my phone Doing powerpoint presentations is a breeze with this function. Battery life is exceptional and will easily get you through 1 day!! The ability to set short cuts with the physical keys is simply awesome and something I did not realize I missed from the blackberries of old. This is a huge time saver for me as I do not to search for apps and settings on my phone. If you are someone who has several email accounts and are on LinkedIn and Facebook you are going to love the HUB. You can easily access all of your messages and notifications in one place and it also has your text messages. I love this feature as I do not need to log into those accounts or apps to view my messages and notifications. Blackberry Blend is another great feature. If you are working on your desktop or laptop you can access everything on your phone (file, emails, texts, etc) and reply from your computer. I also have Sonos speakers throughout my house and was concerned that I would not be able to use my Blackberry to control them. The Sonos App works flawlessly with the Classic. Having spent the better part of month with 3 different Blackberry phones I would recommend these phones to anyone. I still have my Moto X 2014 Pure Edition and have not picked it up in 3 weeks and will be selling it soon as there is nothing I am missing since the switch to Blackberry. In fact I am able to even more with my new phones. One last thing of note I am on ATT and get LTE and the signal strength is the best of all my phones. If you are unsure about BlackBerry because you have read the negative reviews online or fear the company will cease to exist. I would say pick one up and try it and it may surprise you and be your next phone. Well done BlackBerry and thanks for listening to your customers and excited to see what you come up with next!!!Now back to the Passport:The screen is simply amazing (better clarity than the Classic), keyboard is revolutionary, and this thing is super fast. Flicking words from the keyboard saves tons of time and by simply swiping your fingers across the keyboard you can delete words quickly. Download speeds are better than any phone I have ever used. It is a large phone but not too big. It is sturdy and you can tell it is well built. All the great things I spoke about with the Hub apply to this phone as well. To summarize if you are looking for a great device that is the most efficient out there for work and want to enjoy gaming and watching movies and get insane battery life then look no further!!",2014年12月8日 在美国审核
just a completely new experience,"Coming from a Q10, and having been a BlackBerry follower, this is a true evolution with a new take on design, form and function. As a heavy mobile user in the business and real estate industry, I an very satisfied. The Wide screen idea works as intended with great advantages with browsing and document handling. Some items I would say could use improvement: keys are a bit too hard to press than other blackberries, a bit heavier than liked, new method of input using both physical keyboard &amp; screen need to be better (keys too small or awkwardly setup on digital portion) and definitely needs more accessories. Other than that, I LOVE this phone. Definitely needs a new learning experience as to typing, but all good. If they improvement the input typing methods, and you like the wide dimensions, you'll love this phone!",2015年1月2日 在美国审核

"Great keyboard, best Blackberry to date, ruined by non-removable battery.","This is by far the best Blackberry I have ever used. The problems were not even the software or lack of Google Services that render some apps unusable. The main problem is that it takes forever to charge and you can't access the battery so that you can carry a spare. This is just unacceptable in a device that is supposed to be aimed at the hard core user. I used it and got a solid 12 hours out of it, but then I would be stuck to the chord for over 3 hours to get it to be fully charged. On the Q10 I could just carry the spare battery in it's charger and swap batteries and be at full in a matter of minutes and then could leave the battery charging so it will be ready in another 10 hours for a quick swap. I know this isn't a problem for most people but I found this a serious step back. My Note 4 can charge to half in just 30 minutes! Being a power user I don't even use that method and carry the spare battery.If I had that option here I would deal with the limitations of some of the Google services. The keyboard is that good, it's worth not being able to use some apps. Seriously. I miss it so much that for my Note 4 I just use the hot spot and use my laptop for serious emails instead of the onscreen keyboard. It was fast, the camera was very decent for a phone, more pixels doesn't mean a better picture. The camera is very usable. I just can't recommend it if you will be stuck to a chord for that long, I would have a panic attack for long business trips.",2015年2月17日 在美国审核

BB Customer Service is Atrocious and the only real Reason to Avoid this Phone - but do avoid it,"Revision: I had recent awful experience with BB Customer Service and have changed this review to one star from four. I was absolutely alright with the phone but now I'm absolutely furious at Blackberry.They want to replace my phone for a third time due to quality issues.First phone had screen lift as stated below; the replacement phone arrived with a bad sim card reader.The third phone arrived with a bad battery and something wrong with the software. They suggest a fourth replacement (a fourth!), and I decline.I suggested a credit for my remaining value toward a future Blackberry - I'm done monkeying around with a phone which obviously has had quality assurance problems in its manufacture and is just not working while sucking up my time.Blackberry have a) wasted well over four hours of my time on talking on the phone endlessly about this and re-configuring new phones, and b) they not only refuse to issue a credit for the remaining value but c) they offer no alternative solution.I'm quite seriously going to wipe my phone and send it to the electronics recycler for breakup, to keep anyone from having to having to deal with atrocious BB customer service and these issues again.Compared with this I could have spent one hour at an apple store to get a new phone totally set up and running with my same configuration. I could have gotten a million other Android phones. You can see below I really tried with Blackberry and considered this carefully, and now I'm completely furious at them.You should avoid BB products until the company changes their customer service approach.You should also sell your stock in the company if you actually have any.---------------------------original review --------------------------------------------Given the number of ""I've had this phone for two days and here's all the info"" types of reviews on here, I wanted to put in a long-term review. I've owned and used Passport as my daily driver for about nine months now.Tl;dr version: great device, many strengths, and I'm switching to the BB Classic.First, the strengths:* durability - phone looks as good as the day it arrived, after nine months of daily use with no case.* Solidity - this thing is not going to bend or snap. Central piece is stainless steel and even the plastics feel thick and are obviously made to last* Audio quality - is outstanding. I run conference calls, listen to podcasts, do voice notes, and it's the other person who has audio issues and drops, not me. I'm running this on t-mobile on the U.S. west coast, so it's not the best coverage or consistency.* Screen - is sharp and bright and for reading I've never had a phone as smooth. Just excellent.* Editing - I actually do use the phone to edit an occasional word document in French or English and the software is very competent for office documents as well as email editing or commenting. Bilingual dictionaries! Nice touch, Canada!* Dropbox and network integration - as smooth as could be. I realize we may need a couple of enterprise software adjustments etc for maximum security, but the setup and adding things like Dropbox and office networks over the air were smooth as could be, and basic security settings are high.* Keyboard - I came back from iPhone to BB for a real keyboard. So good.So ACCURATE. But really it's keyboard scrolling I'm in love with weirdly. Such a little thing but I appreciate not moving my fingers around and being able to read without the little interruptions. Typing feel is very good, not super-clicky.*Hub - I didn't know what a PITA the older multiple mailbox system was until I re-discovered this one-mailbox system. Apple, Google, Outlook, etc all have a system to try and copy this but none work as well. It's maybe because BB just makes phones and hardware and isn't trying to monetize my entire life, but the Hub and Blackberry Blend software mean I don't have to buy MS Outlook anymore or worry over network constantly - things are synced backed up and protected through my phone, and my phone is encrypted and backed up on its own. Kind of technical but amazing too.* Expandable memory cards up to 128gb - I could probably use my phone as a music library or a server if and when I retire it - it's seriously big and powerful for something this scale.* Plays .flac (lossless) music files, meaning I can have the Passport as a real media Center for high quality sound on the go. This matters if you like your audio as I do, but is a 'nice to have' in the end.* HDMI and miracast - I don't use the phone to run my television but I apparently could. That's pretty amazing and generally unique. Videos could be streamed and projected in high-definition at a conference for example.* Cachet - this is kind of a silly one but in this age of kids telling me I'm not hip to it all the time, I kind of enjoy being 40-something and not having a video-game machine in my hands. Business folks in meetings see the phone like a suit sometimes, and like a ""no-BS"" statement sometimes, and in some areas of my work that's useful.* Some other pros I'm not thinking of right now I'm sure; the Weather app is actually really good.BB Travel app is amazing. Blackberry Blend as some here have commented, is revolutionary.* Bottom line: I've been in a lot of meetings with super-snotty tech people here in San Francisco and I can sell this phone without trying, in most cases.So those are the pros. The twist in this is that I'm trading it in to try the Classic.So what are the cons after all this time?* The keyboard is spaced wide and is not the keyboard I really need for my hand-size.It's a great keyboard, don't get me wrong, but there's a combination of type-type and swipe-to-choose motions which I've never gotten comfortable at.I wind up typing all of my words out because otherwise I have to look and swipe, over and again, which is awkward and distracts me from my writing thought process. Still it's better than a glass keyboard; my friends with much larger hands think the Passport keyboard is perfect so, your mileage may vary. I'm 5'8"" or about 172 cm tall, by the way, pretty average for a guy.* The screen is lifting a tiny but important amount, and my battery runs down quickly, meaning that I had a Quality Control issue here. In addition, Blackberry technical help is not as available as walking in to a store, talking for 15 minutes and getting a new device, so it took me a while to get things sorted with BB customer service. Once sorted, they were very good, fast, clear, calm.New device arrived with a couple of days, all postage paid under warranty. I dearly wish they'd get rid of their India call Center setup, as its obvious that the company wants to do the right thing but the customer service reps are not 'empowered free thinkers'.Was a better experience the fourth time I called than the first three.*It's heavy.I wish I'd got the one with rounded corners. It requires two hands at almost all times except for reading. This is usually okay except when it's not. Fits in pockets, just not light or effortlessly. Still a great phone and doesn't bother me much, until it does. Occasionally bothers me, I mean.* A package of the very basic apps. I use my phone for business as you can tell if you've read this far. Most business features are very smooth and strong on Passport. However a couple core apps are still missing and it's really surprising.Think about my usual business trip. I use Urbanspoon (now called Zomato) to find where to eat. Doesn't work well at all and not native on BB, so I have to go to my iPad or laptop for that.I go to the airport and want to use Uber. No Blackberry app - call a taxi, executive guy. Or I could try the uber app on my iPad. BB Maps works okay for car driving but for walking somewhere or taking the metro in a strange city, you really want Google maps. That's available through installing something somewhere somehow but...am I really supposed to figure all this out? Or could my phone just work for fundamentals like metro directions?This would be okay if Gmaps and Waze were integrated in the BB Maps app. As it is I have three or four GPS apps on my phone but one email hub. Huh? Not exciting.* Finally Password keeper. This is a BB app which is set on your phone to track and record all of your passwords and, with your permission, store them in a vault on your phone. It's a brilliant idea. However when I'm on my desktop at work and need to log in to a website etc, that password is stuck on my phone. Major oops, Blackberry...I wound up buying a premium subscription to LastPass to manage and secure my passwords and keep them available for my browser and apps.In addition, Passport is too wide for a regular GPS holder in my car, so I'm forced to look at getting an $85 special mount which looks like a space alien in my car. I've kept my phone on my leg therefore in maps mode, which is less safe. BB Classic will fit in my standard GPS holder. Finally, GasBuddy which is available in the Amazon apps store yet doesn't have maps integration - it's not a crisis, it's just an inferior app on BB.I realized in owning this phone that what I need a smartphone for are a few limited things: messaging, travel itinerary, navigation in car and on foot, and some reading and lots of podcasts.All the rest I do on my tablet. If BB could develop a set of business-used in-house native secure apps (or just pay a developer outright to do so) for these categories, that would improve their phones considerably. And of course, I'd change my review to five stars.",2015年9月20日 在美国审核

Fantastic device but tough to rate well...,"I bought my Passport in late Nov 2014.It took about a week to get used to the device before really loving it.The Hub is a fantastic notification center.It's easy to see all your e-mails, texts, &amp; notifications all in one place and reply to them easily.The gesture interface it a little weird to get used to when coming from Android or iOS but again, in a week or so, it's second nature.I love having an actual keypad again and the capacitive touch features built into the keypad are very useful.Overall, I really enjoy using this device.The reason for giving it two stars is that I'm on my third passport.The first device had the screen separation issue which many others have had.Amazon was good about returning the device.Since I really enjoyed using my passport, I bought a second one.The second device, the camera wouldn't hold focus and made lots of weird noises while trying to auto-focus.In addition, the whole OS crashed and went into a boot-loop and was unrecoverable.Back to amazon it went after only a week!I very seriously considered opting for another Android device (LG G4) but BlackBerry did such a good job on the design and interface of this phone that I am having a hard time giving up on it.So far my third passport has been working flawlessly (it's only been two weeks) and I hope it continues to perform without problems but my confidence level is very low.I've exclusively used cell phones since 2000 and the only two devices I've had that have failed have both been BlackBerry Passports.I really want this company to succeed but I have my doubts about their quality control.A note about BlackBerry support on their website:It's non-existent!With the first device which failed, I tried to get support through the BB website.They only support devices sold through ShopBlackBerry.com or Amazon and they force you to put in the PIN for the device before you can even ask for support.Although I purchased my device from Amazon.com (not an external seller) Blackberry's website wouldn't acknowledge that it was a device purchased from amazon so there was no way to get any e-mail support.Thankfully, Amazon has fantastic customer service and was receptive to making things right!If you're feeling lucky, give the Passport a try but be warned, it may not last very long and it may be tough to get support...",2015年6月30日 在美国审核

Blackberry Passport review,"I am a long-time Amazon customer and I purchased a new Blackberry Passport from Amazon.com in early March, 2015.I have used Blackberrys for work, and I thought this device had the hardware specs and software features to warrant trying it out as my personal mobile. My previous smart mobiles have been Nexus devices. The Passport, although with a somewhat unwieldy form factor, had been working as expected until recently.It is now early September, and as of a couple of weeks ago the screen has started to come 'unglued' from the bottom right corner and is lifting/separating from the bottom part of the device. As well, the charger is not working anymore (it fails to charge the device.)While the Passport is obviously beyond the 30-day Amazon return period, I believe I should be able to send it back and get a full refund. Surely, nothing is meant to fall apart this quickly.I have resorted to wrapping a strip of transparent Scotch tape around the Passport at the bottom of the screen and charging it with a different Blackberry charger.I am not finding it easy to contact Amazon about this potential return given the time elapsed since the purchase.A few days ago, I wrote an email to John S. Chen, CEO of RIM (I tried to figure out his email address), but I believe it was screened out, and no response has been received to date. In that email I asked whether the company was willing to stand behind this product, give me a ship-to address, take it back, and issue me a full refund.I did not ask for a refurbished or a new Passport.",2015年9月4日 在美国审核

Passport review,"I am enjoying my Passport and all that it has to offer. I love the key board and the pop up word suggestions as well as the camera and it's editing features!

The screen is wide and beautiful.. speakers, AWESOME!Cons: the android APPS consistently shut down, screens fade to black and I have to restart the application.Keys are very stiff but after a while they seem to loose their stiffness. I have to hold the phone with both hands and it's heavy especially with a case on it.All in all I am happy with the phone but would LOVE if Blackberry would re-establish their ties with some of the Apps that they used to carry and no longer do.",2015年1月16日 在美国审核
Very disappointing. Blackberry apps don't work Cannot contact Blackberry customer service to complain.,"Extremely disappointing.So I get my new passport. Looks nice. But I have to try it out first. The main thing I purchased it for was the keyboard so I want to edit a document. Since I am trying it out, I have not enabled my mobile SIM for the time being and I will work through WIFI.I try to access my existing Dropbox account so I can find a document to edit, I click the Dropbox app and click ""I am already a Dropbox user"" and it displays ""Error. Login to Dropbox failed"" I tried to connecting to the Amazon App Store. Similar error. It's possible that I need to connect my SIM card. However, I am not ready to give up my current phone yet (as per T-Mobile, if I switch to another phone and then want to switch back to my current phone, I'll have to get a new SIM card for my current phone.)I try researching this issue online. I see some references to the fact that Blackberry is not functional without a SIM card. However, it doesn't mention the Passport specifically. I decide to contact Blackberry support. Hmm... there only sees to be an email option via an online form. Not very appealing. But I fill in the information anyway (takes me a while because I wanted to explain the issue thoroughly) and I click Send.Guess what?It gives me an error that I did not purchase this through Amazon (see photo) . WHAT? I check and double check my PIN that I entered. It's correct. I double check that I ordered it from Amazon. Indeed it was.

Nice but had to return,"the blackberry has come along way with the latest os, however due to the lack of available apps (have a lot for my work) and constant workarounds required to make this thing fluent I had to defund. More and more businesses rely on certain apps to allow their workers to stay connected on the go and blackberry can't accomplish without work arounds for items like the google play store.I did like the keyboard however I found myself actually typing slower than when I used my iPhone. I think with due time I could have adjusted.The battery life did not impress me. My iPhone 6+ battery and the passport seemed very compatible even favoring the iPhone.Overall I thought about keeping it and having my iPhone at the same time so I could have the best of both worlds. In the end I couldn't justify the price and extra space required to keep the phone. Not to mention the audio jack was defective and let off a screeching sound when used.",2015年6月14日 在美国审核
Work Wide :-),"I have been reading all reviews in here and some of them are more or less interesting. In my humble opinion BlackBerry Passport is one of the most advanced smartphones on the market at this time.I just love my passport. Work wide, make a difference. Don't get scared off by some negative opinions. Some apps are indeed still missing but this phone is a work horse. Battery life is a superb. Amazing screen size. I'm using it on Tmobile network and it performs just fine. Special thanks to BlackBerry for an outstanding product and Amazon for a flawless transaction.Update. As of March 5th,2015 I wouldn't recommend to buy this phone after all. I really have done all my best to like this phone but... Right after last update 10.3.1 I started notice all sorts of problems. Random screen flickering, if the phone gets drained out of juice it will give you a problem to boot. It's simple software isn't optimized for BlackBerry Passport. Too bad I was one the first once to spent 600$ for this phone. At this point honestly I'm not sure what to do. Just in case I still keep my Iphone 5s and that's I'm going back to. The Passport was a nice phone but a software is very buggy. Tool buggy to fully enjoy.",2014年11月3日 在美国审核
the timing of the release was perfect. Any way to the review,"The reason for my purchase is different than most, I think. I simply wanted something different. After going through a bunch of Android phones, jailbreaks, roots, stock and custom ROMs, four generations of the iPhone, and now out of contract, I just wanted to try something else. I didn't actually plan to buy a BlackBerry, it sort of just happened. I ordered it yesterday after about a week of looking for my next phone, the timing of the release was perfect.Any way to the review, just wanted to put a disclaimer that I'm not a BlackBerry fanboy.This phone is absolutely, plain simply, awesome! I have been using it for nearly 6 hours after opening the box, which had about 50% initial battery. I have yet to plug in a USB cable, six hours of setting up the phone, downloading applications, account setups, and the battery is now at 41%. Never seen anything like that.I can download all the application and games I need. If what I'm looking for is not in BlackBerry World, it's definitely in the Amazon App Store. Netflix, Candy Crush, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you name it. The Android Runtime seems to be, at least, faster than actually running it on an Android Phone like Galaxy S4 (my last Galaxy). I guess the hardware on the Passport is just that much better.The BlackBerry Hub is the best, and most productive feature I'd seen. All your emails, BBM, text, Facebook, Twitter, all your notifications in one place, and I thought I'd be a mess to sort through it, but it's not. Each notification has its own identifier.The keyboard, revolutionary. Typing is absolutely easy and fast, you can scroll up, down, left, right on anything by just sliding your finger on the keyboard, no need to touch the screen, like the MacBook's trackpad.If you're looking for, arguably, the most innovative phone in the market, this is it. If you're tired of the same Apple gimmick, or the battery drain on the Android devices, this is the phone for you.",2014年9月25日 在美国审核

Not very usefull as a phone or smart device.,"There are some good features about this phone to like, but several that makes it annoying and nearly useless to use. I'll simply list the pro's and con's.Pro's-Keyboard + it's scroll functions-Really beautiful screen-Build quality-Hardware seems good enough to run programs effortlesslyCons-- Keyboard is too small compared to overall size- Square screen is too big making some applications weird to use.- Applications are non existing outside of work related functions- Square design is much more a problem given the keyboards awkward size.- Calling seems to be a after thought, poor call logs and contact list layout.Overall the phones usefulness was minimal outside of just looking unique. It's uniqueness is simply not worth the price. The uniqueness and cost of my older Nokia E7 surpassed this phone in both function and form. I wish Blackberry would attempt to make a layout similar to that. The only reason i upgraded from that phone was simply because the screen and hardware was outdated.",2017年4月12日 在美国审核

NOT A NEW PHONE,"I am having HUGE problems with this phone. I was led to believe by the seller that this was a NEW phone, but now, 90 days after purchase, there are so many software problems, I HIGHLY suspect this is a REFURBISHED phone.SOFTWARE ISSUES:- Every time I dial a number and begin a call, then switch to a screen to text or browse online, the call screen keeps popping up and interrupting my visual activites- Texting is EXTREMELY slow. When I open a conversation, it takes a good 30 seconds for the conversation to load.- When I attach an image to a text message, the entire screen starts jittering for a good 15 seconds.- When the screen is locked, and I press the power button to unlock it, I may or may not even get the opportunity to type in my PIN, as the screen times out almost as soon as I press the power button- The phone becomes unresponsive frequently. I have to reboot the device several times a day.- When I'm on the phone, and hold it up to my ear, the screen does not go to sleep to prevent me from accidentally touching buttons. So I'll press the power button to make it go to sleep, then it's a fun game of cat and mouse as the screen wakes up a second later, then I press the power button again, only to have it go to sleep and immediately wake up and repeat this cycle the entire call. I've resorted to headphones or the speaker option.- Another reason I suspect this is refurbished is that the BB car cable that came with the device is ""no longer recognized by the device"".- Lastly, I just found over 100 songs by Billy Idol, Daft Punk, and several other bands on the phone!! I've never listened to these guys in my life and barely know who they are. It was difficult and almost impossible to find these songs, but a glitch on the phone opened up some back-end music player and THERE THEY ALL WERE!! that is SO MUCH PROOF that this phone is REFURB, and the sellers are TOTAL LIARS.And just a few more things, which I do not believe are the fault of the seller:- Amazon updates at least once a week, and requires several steps to update (including waiting for downloads) - annoying- The Amazon and BB app stores SUCK. They have absolutely no mainstream apps, including Chrome/Firefox/IE, Netflix (can't get the phone to play Netflix even from browser), Pandora (sometimes works from BB browser), Duolingo, Google Calendar, Google Chat,Mint, etc. It's rather unusable by anyone who uses apps. You can bypass some issues by saving a bookmark to home screen to click on quick, but it's inconvenient and ridiculous. BB needs to get on board with their terrible app store.",2017年5月21日 在美国审核

Mediocre- well built phone with a disjointed and incomplete OS.,"I purchased this phone because I wanted something a little different. I have used Android(Note 5, Note 3), Windows Phone (Lumia 1520, Lumia 950XL, Lumia 1020) and IOS (iPhone 4-6 Plus) and frankly they all have drawbacks. I figured with a square screen and a built in keyboard along with some really nice looks, this might be the phone for me!The good:The build quality is very good. Very solid phone that feels good in the hand.The style looks great, very modern and I like the stainless steel look and the textured backThe keyboard buttons have a great feel and are back lit.The bad:It is running a half baked android OS masquerading as Blackberry 10 OS. It is very disjointed and if you use the standard blackberry world store you will find that you are not getting a lot of apps. If you sideload you can use the google play store and it isn't too difficult if you are technically inclined but it seems like a lot more effort than it should be.The OS just feels clunky and disjointed, it seems like I would rather just run android on this unit and it would make things easier. all in all it feels like the hardware is built well but the operating system is incomplete.I ended up returning this phone because the screen started flickering, and that was enough for me.",2016年3月25日 在美国审核

A Solid Phone With Some Minor Hiccups.,"This is a beautiful phone. You either love its form factor or you don't. I love it. The phone looks the part; classy and sophisticated. It feels like something that can withstand anything you throw at it (please do not take this literally!) and feels good to the touch.The screen size can be jarring at first but once you get used to it, you can appreciate the value it brings to the phone. Reading on it is a pleasure. Viewing pictures on it is great. Browsing the internet on it is solid. However, the screen size/ratio becomes a problem when you try to view videos. You will get those pesky black bars on the top and at the bottom.The keyboard feels solid. A bit noisy but if you wanted perfect silence, you would buy an all touch screen phone. Just remember, if you like to type in quiet places, you will be given ""the look"" when using this phone.BB10, the OS that runs the phone, is a pretty stable operating system. However, it does not have a lot of apps in its native store. To get more apps you can download Android apps from 3 additional sources.1. The Amazon App Store. The store comes preloaded on the device. This is a straight forward and convenient way to install Android apps on the Passport. However, it is not my preferred method. I do not like how much slowly it is to download apps from it. Also, every time you download an app from this store, Amazon sends you an email. Not a big deal but 10 emails later and it can get annoying.2. SNAP. This is my preferred method. This Android marketplace does not come preloaded on the phone but you can install it on your own. Level of skill needed to install it, I would say a 6/10. It is not a straight forward install but once it is on there, it is a breeze to start getting Android apps. Also, it has more apps than Amazon's App store, in my view.3. Sideloading. Do not use this, unless you absolutely know where you are getting the files from. In this method, you download the app files from the web and install them directly to the phone. Bad idea.Still, when you download and run Android apps on this phone, be aware that these are still Android apps. They sometimes do not function as well. A lot of them crash into a black screen and you have to close it out. An example would be the Amazon Cloud Photo app. I love that app but it does not run on this Phone.The camera on this phone is average, at best. Do not buy this phone if you are into photography. The response time from the camera is slow and it fails miserably in low light situations. I cannot stress this enough. If you shoot during daylight or with flash, the pictures it captures are actually good. However, I hate flash photography. I would rather capture the picture without the harshness of flash. When I tried this on my Passport, the camera hunted for a few seconds trying to lock into my subject. When the shot was finally captured, it was blurry and useless. Video on low light is beyond terrible. It literally lags and freezes at times.The battery life on this phone is incredible. I literally use it all day and still have more than half my battery life available. You can use this phone for two days without reaching for the charger. Easy.Call phone reception: Due to the nature of my job, I always walk around with multiple phones. I have found that this phone holds its own quite well when it comes to cell reception. However, and this is important, if you use T-Mobile you won't be able to use WiFi calling. This is not BlackBerry's fault. T-Mobile does not carry the Passport. Subsequently, no WiFi calling. Please be aware of this, if you are a T-mobile subscriber and if that feature is important to you.Without a doubt, this is the best BlackBerry phone out there. It is sleek and classy. It is also very fast and responsive. However, it is not on par with the flagships of the other platforms. Still, it does not need to be. If you want a phone that is efficient and durable, this is the phone for you. If you need a phone that has incredible battery life; this is the phone for you. If you need a phone that's a head turner, this is the phone for you. If you, however, need a phone that can double as a media device, there are more capable phones out there.",2015年1月16日 在美国审核
I love it,Edit: Apps are so slow and work so bad. (I don't use many apps only necessary ones like Uber). I'm running out of patience and have to buy a new iphone or itouch to just be able to use the apps. Charges really slow too and I bought a new charger to see if it will work better. Sigh I really wanted to like it.Original:I chose the white passport which looks just as cool and more feminine. The keyboard is divine and many cool functions makes the typing and browsing fun and convenient. I didn't have a blackberry before but I didn't feel there's a learning curve or getting used to. It's like designed for me. I just love it. It's not too big. I'm a five feet tall girl and yes its a little bit big for a jeans pocket but I don't put phone in jeans pocket anyways. It's really unique and the back of the phone is like baby skin. Yes the app store is different from apple but I still found the apps I want to use. I love it!

"Didn't match my excitement, for BB enthusiasts","The device looks attractive and is definitely large, which I'm fine with. The build quality is exceptional.When I hold this in my hand, it feels like it's a professional device.Ultimately, after being an iPhone user for about 3 years, I found it hard to go back to a physical keypad. I generally used two hands for typing on this device and I noticed fatigue and pain. The device is quite heavy compared to an iPhone 6+.Also, I was excited to see what the new OS had to offer since I hadn't used a BB device since the Curve. Some of the benefits of the BB OS are very nice like the message hub (one place for all your messages).I also liked the fimiliar blinking red light for notifications. Finally, I liked the quick app changing capabilities.The camera on this device was poor. I was excited that it was 13 MP but this is a classic case of where specifications don't matter. The focus was very slow and rarely found clarity. Action shots were always blurry. The colors seemed off.The front camera was even worse.I knew going into it that the apps were limited.There were some standard apps like FB, Twitter, and LinkedIn but other apps I was used to were either hard to find or non existent.Also, the Amazon store was very limited and didn't have simple apps like NetFlix.The BB app store was pretty bland as well but did have some native apps that performed very well. There was a 3rd party Instagram app in the BB store and it served it's purpose.As much as I wanted to love this phone, I just couldn't appreciate it.It looks cool and professional but I found myself missing my iPhone 6+. The screen is beautiful and the battery life is probably the best on the market but I couldn't assimilate back to the keypad or work flow on the device.To BlackBerry's credit, they did have one very neat innovation which was the built in track pad. It actually made browsing a tad bit easier, especially for one handed use.Speaking of the browser, many sites didn't load or render properly.If you're a die hard BB fan and love the OS, this could be a powerhouse you've been waiting for.For me, it's back to the iPhone.Ask me any questions and thank you for reading!",2014年12月31日 在美国审核

Even the apps that are supported, like Evernote, are outdated, never updated and have few features. You have to find ridiculous workarounds to get basic apps to work on this phone, and even then it's slow, wonky, unpredictable and functions at about 70%.There's obviously a reason that Blackberry has gone the way of the dinosaur, so do yourself a favor and go with a phone that you'll know if future-proof.

Honest review.,"I have had the blackberry passport for about 3-1/2 weeks. I Decided to give Blackberry a try coming from a iPhone 4s and tired of iPhone and android phones there all the same plus I used to love my curve back in 2010-11. I loved the design of this phone it's different than anything else on the market and it definitely turned some heads. But I'm speaking in past tense because I am returning the phone to Amazon due to a few issues that I can't live with. 1 and this is the biggest problem I don't have access to most of the apps that I need for my everyday life like It doesn't have a app for my bank, my credit card, or my brokerage firm. These are things that I check numerous times throughout the day and without the app it's a real pain. I wasn't even bothered about the lack of gaming apps because I knew that before I bought it plus I don't even play games2. For some reason I can't watch videos on the Internet not even YouTube or Instagram videos. I found myself still using my iPhone 4 everyday. I just feel like i would be comprising too much just to have a different looking phone not to mention having to switch to AT&amp;T from Verizon and them messing my plan up and not having internet outside of wifi even though it was in my plan. So today I went back to Verizon and bought a iPhone 6 plus and I was instantly relieved. This would be a great phone if it weren't for these few issues.",2015年3月13日 在美国审核

I don't have to constantly type in my password for my bank apps etc (I have 1password).Also at work I can trade stock instantly with etrade without typing in password. This is a significant convenient factor for me.Too bad if the apps were decent enough I would have kept the passport.Maybe passport2 will have more apps for the square screen.",2014年12月18日 在美国审核

I think it sounds sonically better than my s6 edge and iPhone 6+. You can even play flac files!Of course there's nothing like the hub which truly makes this device a joy to use. The hub gives you confidence that you're never missing any messages.It's a steal at this price. I highly recommend it.,2015年8月12日 在美国审核
"The phone is great, but when it went bad after 6 months ...","Do not purchase from Amazon. The phone is great, but when it went bad after 6 months I was not able to get it fixed. Amazon told be to contact Blackberry and Blackberry told me to contact Amazon. And I use this phone for mission critical business.At the end of my second chat with Amazon “support"" I asked the guy how to cancel my Prime account and all he said was “I’ll do it for you.” That is all!

Read this review before you buy this device!,"Perhaps the single most unpleasant consumer purchasing experience I have ever had.As I am in the category of ""mature worker"", I have had many unpleasant ""customer service"" experiences over several decades, which I mention simply to emphasize the points of comparison that contributed to this being the ""worst"".I am a die hard BB fan and have had only BB cell phones for 10 or 12years.I have purchased cell phone service from T Mobile for over 10 years.I researched phones for almost a year before deciding on the Passport because of its features and flexibility. I tried and tried to buy thru BB online, to no avail.Their website indicated that if you want a Passport, you purchase thru them (sold out, no option to back order) or Amazon.Once I made my decision, I shopped for a couple more months, still unable to order thru BB online.I called BB, I called T Mobile, AND Amazon and was assured by ALL parties that customer service would be there in a minute if any problem.Ordered from Amazon, delivered quickly, set it up easily.....months went by and the phone completely died......I had an unstoppable reboot cycle, the device was not recognized by my computer so couldn't wipe and reload the software, and because the battery is not removable, no option to reboot that way.(Prior to this I was extremely happy with the phone. It was everything I had hoped.)TMobile services other BB's, but not the Passport; their tech department has never seen a Passport, at least according to three techs on two separate days.BB will not service because it was an Amazon purchase.Amazon was ""so sorry"" but since I was beyond 60 days of the purchase (I think I was on day 72 or 75) too bad, no exchange, no refund, no customer service.I asked for my concern to be ""elevated"" and was rerouted to some guy in Morocco, who was no help either.I asked for a supervisor, and was passed on to another person, who eventually agreed that this was less than stellar service.He agreed to a ""one time replacement"", which I accepted.I feel it is important to note that this was offered only after I described in pretty heated terms how angry I was, and explained that I would likely continue to elevate my frustrated concerns to upper management.I wish I could say this all ended happily.Not so.I have had my second new Passport for about a month.It is already doing some of the same things as the first Passport, as well as some new glitches, and these all seem software related (When I attempt to open my Outlook calendar, the screen flashes; it will mysteriously go to a black screen at totally random times with no warning; it occasionally decides to stop syncing with my desktop Outlook, it randomly stops receiving email and text messages but ""looks"" normal otherwise, and SO much more).I have already had to wipe it and reload everything. Twice.I haven't even tried to call customer service this time, I am so fed up and the mere thought makes me angry.When it works, I absolutely love this device.Since that appears to be hit or miss on any given day, I really hate this device.I am sorry I purchased it.I am even sorrier I purchased it through Amazon.I regret not listening to that nagging internal voice that said I'd be ill advised to buy a first generation phone from Amazon.IF you choose to buy a Passport, check everything about the warranty.This device is still so new that it appears they have not worked out the software bugs and the non removable battery makes a difference.If you purchase thru BB and your device fails, they will have you send it back for repair, with no date certain for a return (this is what 2 BB techs told me by phone).If you buy from Amazon, all warranty is with Amazon, and BB will tell you your only recourse is to talk to Amazon if your problem is something that cannot be solved by generic read from the manual over the phone tech support...read the very, very fine print on the website, and read is carefully.BB will NOT repair or replace a Passport purchased on Amazon.That old adage about ""it only takes one bad sale to lose a lifetime customer"" - I really understand this now.I can understand the first generation technical problems with the device, and half expected this.Hard to accept that Amazon, my phone carrier AND Blackberry all wash their hands of any accountability, pointing fingers at the others.Wait for generation 2 or later, then buy the Passport.",2015年3月11日 在美国审核

No more sitting on the fence,"This is my first BlackBerry.The Silver Edition Passport looks much better in person than in pictures: made of beautifully crafted stainless steel, it does not look or feel cheap, and it is very solid: have already dropped it on a stone floor once (very first day) and no damage whatsoever, the leather flip case helped of course.My first reaction when I unboxed it was: wow it's wide, maybe too wide... it felt big and heavy compared to my old HTC. But after using it for a day, I quickly got accustomed to holding and using the Passport (it fits in all my pockets btw). The wide screen and KB offer numerous advantages over traditional smartphones, and in my case, the convenience it brings to being mobile make it totally worth it. I actually use my phone for work a lot more often now.My Android can do most of the things my Blackberry can, but the candy bar shape, narrower screen and lack of physical KB make some tasks too tedious to attempt a second time on a normal phone. Think of all the times you turn to your tablet or desktop/laptop to do something that would never occur to you to do on your phone, a Passport would change your ways.My job requires me to be mobile but I don't need to carry my tablet with me anymore. The Blend app lets me remotely access files on my desktop/laptop/tablet hard drive via Cellular network or Wifi; I can also access and use many of the phone's functions from any remote computer if I forget it at home.This is my first phone with a physical KB and I like it very much. The KB/Touchpad allow to effortlessly edit text (including cut and paste between documents), and is the main reason I do not dread using a phone for work anymore.The OS is very refined and powerful, with many features (like programmable KB shortcuts), but simple to use: the Home button has been replaced by a swipe Up gesture from the bottom of the screen; navigation is very simple once you stop looking for the Home/Back buttons, it's all swipe based (left, right, up, down; each have a function depending of the context). The tutorials are pretty good and made learning the phone easy. Deleting stuff (emails, pictures, messages) is very quick with the KB, press Backspace to delete and then press Enter just below it to confirm... it's a lot quicker than touching the screen at two different places, the KB is responsive and works each time a key is pressed.I never was the type to use agendas, calendars, reminders and to do lists. I tried a few times before but found the process too time consuming and inefficient so I would rarely use them. But everything changed with the Hub, it's very easy to use, efficient and does most of the work for you. All your notifications, multiple email accounts, messages, reminders, unified calendars, FB, Twitter, BBM, etc... are all in one place and easy to view/filter/sort. For example, you receive an email or message and are asked to do something important... so you know you should create a reminder or put it in your agenda, but you're lazy and don't feel like working... with BB10, just highlight/select the relevant text in the email, edit and select ""copy to reminder"" or ""calendar"", enter the due date and a title and voila! your alarm is set and calendar automatically updated, and all tasks are easy to access and view.Apps: I have all the apps I need. I sideloaded the Snap app which gives me access to Google's Play store and the process was very easy, just follow the steps at CrackBerry (search how to install Snap).I could go on and on about the Passport but it would take too long. I'll resume by saying: call quality,reception, speakers and camera are all excellent.",2015年8月9日 在美国审核

This is an excellent phone that successfully satisfies both entertainment and business needs with no compromises.,"Best phone on the market by far. I received it 3 days ago and I am loving it. Battery life blows my mind. I took the phone off charger at 7am and still had over half battery at 10pm, after a full day of average use, including watching videos, many calls, emails and texts. Keyboard is excellent and the swipe functionality to insert suggested words is fantastic. Screen resolution is great and I love the fact that I don’t need to swipe on the screen if I don't want to when I navigate a page: ugly fingerprints-on-screen problem resolved! The processor is super-fast. The size of the screen makes it possible to work on large files and spreadsheets as well as watch videos with superior performance. Speakers are loud and excellent quality of sound. Camera is comparable to iPhone. Usability is very good and very intuitive. Our household has 1 HTC, 2 iPhone 5 and a Samsung S4. The Passport is by far the best by admission of all family members.About the size: it DOES fit comfortably in my pockets, both Jeans and slacks. And unless you have weirdly small hands, you will manage just fine.About Apps: so far I found every app I like and need with the only exception of Waze. The native BB navigation app is very good but I do wish Waze was there.This is an excellent phone that successfully satisfies both entertainment and business needs with no compromises.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核
What is all the hype about?,"Just so you know my perspective, I'm a 23yo female. Usually use Sony Xperia androids.I had really high hopes for this phone, however, it did not meet my expectations.When I first received the phone, I noticed that on the packaging the tape was covering two previous layers. I just figured maybe it was for a quality check.. nahh. Perhaps that was wishful thinking. I've come to the conclusion that this phone I ordered as new, had to have been used. I'm not getting this spectacular battery that everyone is talking about. I'm not using it nonstop, but I will definitely have to recharge tonight (even though I unplugged it this morning). Not too crazy, but after reading all the reviews, I'm rather disappointed. Maybe I just got one of the exceptions.Wouldn't be as upset if I didnt pay full price for, what I assume, is a refurbished phone.",2015年1月23日 在美国审核

Amazing phone. Puts you at the peak of productivity.,"I've been a former blackberry user with my bold 9900, and was honestly incredibly disappointed with the company and its phones when I've experienced maps which never work, a browser that's slow as a snail, crashing phones where i'd always have to pull out my battery, and lastly the lack of productive apps. I've since moved to the iPhone 5 in 2012 and thought I'd never look back.The passport though, is really something different. Before, one huge factor that caused me to switch from BB to iPhone was because of the apps and the speed of the phone. However, after using the iPhone for 2 years. I honestly COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT THE APPS.I realize what really was more important to me - which is the productivity of my phone - NOT candy crush, angry birds, flappy birds, or any other games. I barely even visit the apple app store anymore. Also, I have since passed my honeymoon phase with all the iPhone apps, and honestly have no other game apps on my phone - only the productive ones.I've received my blackberry passport and absolutely LOVED it. Typing on touchscreen never really bothered me, however, being able to write a paragraph of email and jump back to the middle of it did. Where iphone requires you to keep trying to touch that spot in between the words to add a paragraph, blackbery passport does it simply by moving the cursor over.The phone is fast. The amount of apps they have now is exactly what I need to stay productive ( i could care less about the other stuff ). And MOST IMPORTANTLY of all, I feel SO good to have instant push on my email again rather than having to wait 15 minutes every time on an iphone.The square screen is awkward at first. Not gonna lie. But when I'm reading articles or books while in transit, this is SO MUCH BETTER. No longer do I have to side-scroll my page on an iphone which gets quite annoying.Overall blackberry has done an amazing job with this phone. Though not perfect (maps, blackberry assistant, and camera could be a bit quicker and upgraded). But I have high hopes for their products in the future.Get the passport for productivity. you won't regret it.",2014年9月26日 在美国审核

Powerhouse of Mobile Technology,"Had this phone for 2 days so far, before this I was using iPhone 5s and the Oneplus One, I absolutely love this phone, quality is felt through the material as well as the weight of the phone, makes my Oneplus feel like a plastic toy.A few points I want to address.SizeThe phone is more wide than long, it does fit in jeans pockets just fine, better than Oneplus One in my opinion since Oneplus is much longer. Other than that I don't think the size of the phone is really a big deal, I prefer the width for typing.ScreenScreen is beautiful, super sharp and crystal clear, the color tint is slightly on the yellow side but that can be adjusted under setting.AppsNo problems at all, If you're holding off on buying this phone due to lack of apps on Blackberry World or Amazon App Store, you should look into Snap, its an app that works the same way as Google Play Store. I side loaded Snap (Took 3 mins) and installed Blackmart, I was able to use all apps I had on my Oneplus (around 50 apps or so) except for Viber, Billguard as well as some of the Google Apps such as Google Chrome, and Google Maps. Other than that, all of the apps I was able to download runs perfectly, some even better on the Blackberry.Some of the Apps I'm able to download were:LineFlipBoardPocketMultiple Banking AppCurrencyEbayAmazonPayPalIMDBSoundHoundSoundCloudMusicXPocket CastsPowerampSpotify8TracksMaps.MeAirbnbYahoo WeatherAnother thing to note here is the ease of switching from Apple or Android to Blackberry. All you need to do is download an app call Device Switch on your Apple or Android device, and download the same one on your Blackberry, and it will do the rest. The transfer includes all of your contacts, photos, music, and calendar.BatteryAbsolute beast, I haven't charged it yet, still at 25% battery on my 2nd day, and I've been playing with the phone all day.EmailI get emails on my phone around 3-5 min faster than I get them on my Mac or my Oneplus, I use Gmail and Hotmail.Blend and LinkBlend allows you to use your laptop (Mac and Windows are both compatible) to answer emails, text messages, and more. Link lets you drag and drop files onto your phone, including documents, picture, and music. Both of these apps works surprisingly well, much better than my android experience where my Mac couldn't even detect my phone, had to do some research, download some appropriate apps for it to work properly. Blackberry did a great job on making this easy, as soon as your phone is plugged into your computer, it opens a folder containing install files.CameraTake a little long to focus, so if you're shooting a moving object, you may have some trouble, still shots are not a problem, quality of the picture is great, color is really accurate.TrackpadBrilliant idea doubling the keyboard as a trackpad, it works extremely well for text deleting, scrolling, and letter selecting, I much prefer this over the touchscreen for word editing.All in all I'm very impressed with the phone, It's a powerhouse of mobile technology, excellent battery life combined with innovative keyboard and super sharp screen, it took me around 30 mins to get use to the OS, my previous devices includes Apple, Samsung, HTC, and Oneplus One, I had no previous experience with Blackberry devices.Hope this helps.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核
Love at first sight.,"There is no doubt in my mind that if you hold Blackberry Passport in your hand, you will immediately notice the craftsmanship and build-quality of this product. Its OS is ""buttery smooth"" and very intuitive. The size and resolution of the screen, blackberry hub, and notification led are some of my favorite features of this phone.I didn't buy it from Amazon, I ordered it last month from shopblackberry. Yesterday I went to our local AT&amp;T store, they gave me a nano sim card and updated IMEI in their system. After inserting the sim card, I rebooted the phone and it immediately picked up LTE signal. I was able to setup my Gmail account and unlike my iPhone4s, push email really worked on blackberry passport.To be honest I was a bit concernedif I will be able to use Visual Voice Mail (VVM) like I was using on my iPhone. The good news is VVM is also working.If you're looking for a smartphone that has a big screen, a long battery life, excellent build-quality then Blackberry Passportshould be on your short list.",2014年11月4日 在美国审核

Stop buying toys and get a real Phone!,"The first day I was frustrated. By the end of the week it is amazing. Operating system is extremely fluid and can multitask 8 programs at a time!!! You can load your YouTube playlist, minimize and do Microsoft office work using included Docs to go. Music player is awesome. Headphones are good quality, but I need tiny buds and Blackberry's are huge! Took a 40 min video in 1080p of a church service when regular camera was forgotten and it looks pretty good for a phone, will be posting it to YouTube. Can not comment on camera as of yet, have not taken put very few photos. Word prediction is better than iOS or Android. Still am not used to the active keyboard I am using the screen to scroll, but when I catch myself, it does make viewing web pages a pleasure. The Hub is the genius of the whole phone. I used to waste a ton of time sorting emails, then going to Facebook sorting them, then going to YouTube sorting them, but now the Hub allows me to answer within the hub itself without loading 5 email accounts. I clear the junk out in seconds. As a matter of fact you could run your whole office from this phone. The GPS using Maps.me (an offline free map GPS app), so far has been the most accurate GPS I've every used including TomTom, Waze, Google, or Sygic. I put a mount in my windshield, place the phone in the mount, when a call comes in I answer with speaker phone and I can hear perfect and so does the listener. Hands free calling, without a bluetooth hanging out of your ear. As a matter of fact the wife and I both were able to communicate on a phone call. I was driving and she was the passenger. The other party could hear us both. Games? I don't have time to play games, but when I do it is played on an 8 core computer, with a mouse. Apps? I use the Hub. Docs To Go. (Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word document editing and authoring.) Map.me GPS. Remember. (reminder app for shopping and such) Assistant. (Blackberry's version of Siri). Browser. Photo viewer. Video viewer. Alarm clock. Calculator. Maps. Blend. (Your phone functions on the PC!! or Mac!!) Contacts. Calendar. BBM. (fantastic messaging app for all platforms) Phone. Texting. Battery life is almost unbelievable. I filmed a 40 min vid, sorted emails, listened to music all day and still had 43% battery life!!! Cons? A tight fit in a dress shirt pocket. I opted for a tethered document carry that I wear around my neck for a caring case. Works fantastic. Fits perfect in rear pocket or suit jacket pocket. Watching videos is not as good as my 5.7"" LG Stylo. The quality is awesome but the square screen does block some of the video. But even when I was sent a video I went from the LG back to the Passport because it is easier to hold.",2016年10月4日 在美国审核

Really works,"I bought one on a whim, but I am very happy. Such a refreshing approach to a phone.Pros:- free from google's prying eyes. Really, this was an unexpected bonus. BB tries to make money off your IT boss and not your personal information. I found google trying to be clever about my email really creeppy because I knew they will try to sell me something. But when BB travel reads my email and pulls out the flight departure info, I think: ""Great!""- BB hub really works! As in messages, email, whatsup, everything in one place. Finally a client I can use and that works with IMAP and my way of doing things.- keyboard: probably some 15 years old kid types 17x faster on a screen, but I'm not a teenager. I don't think I am actually that much faster on real keyboard, but it feels much less annoying. Now I actually write production level emails on my phone, not just ""i'll be back""....- battery life good- OS just generally polished, much more than I expected- android compatibility layer runs spotify without hiccups and this is really the only app I care about. But other apps run fine as well, so all in all works better than expected. Delta app crashed a couple of times.Cons:- One 1star reviewer complained that gmail crashes: this phone is useful when you use it the way BB intended -- you read your gmail within BB hub, *not* on gmail app, because android compatibility layer is really just a hack after all. So don't use it if you really want to use google services- maps are ok, have restaurants, directions and traffice, but well, google maps are just better I think. No public transport in BB maps. There are external interfaces to google maps that kinda work, but not terribly well.",2014年11月30日 在美国审核

Way to make a solid comeback BlackBerry.....happy to be back after four years in Apple and Samsung land!!!,"I bought the AT&amp;T version and just love it. I was using a Galaxy Note 3 prior to switching to the Passport. I was having frustrations with the virtual key board on the Note 3. I longed for the days of a real key board--for me, it had been four years since my last Blackberry device.Things I like:-keyboard-message hub-Blackberry blend (when I get to the hotel on business travel, I can actually text via my laptop!)-Plenty of Android apps work well on this platform-I like the quality build. I feel confident putting this phone in my back pocket (unlike the iPhone Plus)-Super fast processor-Battery life is incredible. My Note 3 never made it past 2 PM. As I'm writing this review at 4:30 PM, battery is at 64% on my Passport. I charge my phones overnight and start using it at around 7:30 AM.Dislikes-Obviously, the screen shape is not ideal for video. I travel with a Galaxy Tab to watch video--like Netflix.-Still getting used to half of the keyboard being virtual. Numbers and special characters are accessed via a virtual button right above the actual keyboard.-The phone is a bit heavy. Not sure if this is a negative as I'm glad it has an aluminum frame to make it durable.-Camera is not nearly as capable as the one on my Note 3.I'll update as I get better acquainted with this phone. I'm writing this report after having the phone for about one week. I'm sure I'll discover additional pros as well as cons.",2015年3月2日 在美国审核

"2 Day Battery, Fits in your pocket, Messaging Powerhouse","Pros:- Long Battery Life (Gone 2 days without recharging, on heavy use/workweek)- Great Antenna Coverage (Places where I didn't get bars with my old phone now get bars)- Large Screen- Responsive physical touch keyboard- Fits in all my pockets, comfortablyCons:- A tad wide- On/Off/Sleep button should be on the side.- Lack of accessories (at launch)- had to get a nano simPurchased mine directly from the BlackBerry online store with the Black Hard Shell case.To begin, this device will not cater to everyone. The phone is wide but it only took me 1-2 weeks to get used to the size and the keyboard. The keyboard and the large screen I must say are the best physical features of this device. The large screen has allowed me to see everything I need to see in a single glance, often I still carry my previous rectangular phone with me and I always find it weird and annoying when I don't see everything I am used to seeing with my Passport. The 1440x1440 pixel screen on the Passport really makes it noticeable when I go back to my old phone. The keyboard is one of the most innovative features of this phone with its scrolling feature for webpages, facebook, Instagram, twitter, etc is awesome. Lets me enjoy the larger screen without my thumb being in the way. The touch keyboard is also really useful when I flick type, as it is one of the features I am used to from my previous phone.What really surprised me and made me really happy to ""hear"" is how loud and clear the speakers are on this device. Loudness is one thing but the Tone range on this phone is also phenomenal. I use the Bluetooth feature a lot on this phone as well, I have invested in (thanks to Amazon) a set of over the ear and in ear Bluetooth earphones. I have the Bluetooth radio on all day and it doesn't effect my 2 day battery, I was very very shocked to see this. I was expecting a battery drain, but that 3450mAh battery just keeps going.On the software front I know many people will go straight to complaining about the lack of apps the platform has. I find that the apps I need are available through BlackBerry developers creating unique BlackBerry versions of the popular apps like Instagram and Vine. While he platform may not have the official apps I find that the native BlackBerry apps work better than the Android versions and in some cases the developer has added more functionality than the Instagram or Vine developer teams do. Now with 10.3 the Amazon App store also becomes available and I found that even though the Amazon App store is an android app running on the Passport, it feels natural and smooth. I am very appreciative of BlackBerry working closely with Amazon to ensure the app store app runs smoothly on the 10.3 OS.While apps are great, I think people forget than the phone's operating system itself is one huge app. The BlackBerry Hub is one of the best messaging tools to date. Having all of my emails, Facebook messages &amp; notification, Twitter notifications, Instagram notifications (through iGrann - BlackBerry Instagram App) and any other notifications come directly into the hub is just great for me to quickly respond to people and keeps me on top of all my responsibilities.Overall I love the great battery life, the large screen, and the touch physical keyboard. Like I said at the beginning, this phone is not for everyone. This phone caters to people like me who are extremely busy and need a device that keeps up with the pace, and doesn't die halfway through the day. I compose many many emails, check various desktop only websites and always need access to all my files. It really is a laptop in my hand.",2014年10月18日 在美国审核

From then on, I have always been a full-touch device user and quickly saw the benefits to all-touch over physical QWERTY devices. I was a heavy Z10 user, but the battery life was pretty terrible. Used a spare battery everywhere I went. I finally moved up to the Z30 and was a bit weary of the size, but it ended up being a great device.But now to the part that you are actually curious about. The Passport.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE DEVICE/REVIEW----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been using this guy for just over two weeks (I got one at the Toronto launch event) and was blown away by how big and bulky this thing felt in my hands. I was happy they gave me the device, but I was pretty sure I was going to stick with my all-touch device.I slowly began using the Passport, switching between it and my Z30 for a few days. I have fairly small hands and they would start cramping up a bit after using the Passport for a couple hours. This made me a bit worried but I continued trucking on. After about 4 days or so the hand cramping went away and I finally began typing to the speeds that I was at on my Z30. The keyboard was so weird at first having the ""V"" and the ""B"" next to the spacebar, but after a week I was completely used to it. Now typing any other way feels odd to me.The onscreen keyboard row was tough to get used to as well because you are now going between typing on physical buttons to typing on the screen in-between sentences. This is something that I got used to after a while but I really had to stick with it.The touch sensitive keyboard is really cool as well. At first I was just using it because it was new and fun, but now I actually prefer using it to touching the screen because the surface just feels smoother and easier to drag my finger across.The build quality is amazing. It's by-far the toughest phone I think I have ever held. This is the first phone that I have used without a case on it and NOT been so worried as to drop it because I know this thing can take a beating.The camera, I mean come on.. 13MP with OIS (Optical Image Stabilization), you know, the thing that the iPhone 6+ has that everyone is drooling over. Oh, and 4K requires 8.4MP or higher so it is capable of 4k video recording (if/when BlackBerry implements it) so the device is definitely future-proofed. This thing is amazing, BlackBerry has never been good with cameras but I am very pleasantly surprised. It seems to almost always use a flash though, which is fine because it makes the pictures look very clear and bright. You can just turn the flash off if you don't want it to be on in certain occasions.The screen is absolutely gorgeous. High resolution, you can zoom-out in Android apps to utilize the high pixel density and wide screen. Speaking of which, I find it quite jarring going back to a candybar-style device after having used this shape for so long. I really feel like everything is cut-off on the left and right when viewing websites, using apps, and messaging people/writing/viewing emails. There's not much more I can say about the thing, I was not sold on it at first. Not at all. But I gave it a solid week and then I fell in love with it. I had my pain points at times, but if there is one thing I want you to get out of this review is that if you stick with it and give it a week, you will absolutely fall in love with it too. My only worry for this device's success is the learning curve it takes to get used to. I really hope people don't use it for a day or just try it out in the store and make the decision right then and there that it's not right for them.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A FEW LESSER KNOWN PRO TIPS I HAVE LEARNED BY USING IT----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Double tap anywhere on the keyboard within a message to pop up the on-screen cursor and then move it around by swiping your finger across the keyboard. I have found that swiping between the keys on the frets gives me the best cursor control.2. If you press and hold on the uppercase on-screen key while the cursor is up and swipe over the keyboard, you are able to quickly highlight words or blocks of text without ever dragging your hand over the screen.3. If you hold down the alt key and press the physical buttons, you get a number-lock feature where the on-screen keyboard rows correspond to the physical buttons and you can type in symbols/numbers without even having to touch the screen.4. Aside from swiping backwards over the keyboard to delete a word, you can open up the symbols by either swiping down or tapping the symbols key on screen and delete numerous words at a time by swiping multiple fingers over the on-screen keyboard rows. e.g. 1 finger deletes one word each swipe, 2 fingers deletes two words at a time, and so on for 3 and 4 fingers.5. Utilizing the physical QWERTY keyboard, you can easily use emulators and play action-based games with ease. Try doing that with an all-touch device. Spoiler alert - it's nearly impossible. I personally use the GameBoy Color emulator and have been playing games like Zelda from when I was younger and this thing is like having a giant GameBoy Color with a beautiful screen.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT THE END OF THE DAY----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I highly recommend this phone and don't see myself going back to an all-touch device ANYTIME soon. This form factor is built to be a two-handed device so I don't see why so many of the biggest complaints about this device are that it's not all that easy to write messages with one hand. Absurd.I urge you to try the phone for a few days, preferably a week or so, and then you will be able to see what makes this device so great. It was definitely a love-hate relationship at first but I just had to give it a chance and use it for a bit. I can definitely tell you now that I am happy I gave this phone a chance.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核

Excellent device!,"BlackBerry did a great job with the Passport. I was concerned about the size of the phone at first, but holding it it's not as wide as the pictures make it seem and it fits in jeans or pants pockets.Going in categories based on my first impression.The battery life is amazing. After 8 hrs with moderate use of web, email (5 email accounts), and apps (3-4 activate frames running) my battery was at 75%. The phone also comes with a Device Monitor which provides information on battery, memory, CPU, and mobile data usage, and is extremely useful in locating resource draining apps, and this one is actually easy to read and understand.Screen quality/size are great. 1440x1440px resolution is crisp. I no longer dread visiting Full/Desktop sites and viewing documents/spreadsheets is a lot better.Touch-sensitive physical keyboard. I don't know how they did it, but I'm really enjoying swiping to delete words and pick suggested words on the physical keyboard. No learning curve on those two features. I haven't used the keyboard to scroll through webpages and apps too much yet, but the times I have it works well. Keyboard itself has a quality feel to it, combination of physical and context virtual keys works great as well.Build quality. The Passport is a solid phone with a premium look and feel to it. Stainless steel frame is a nice touch.BlackBerry 10.3 OS and Android support. BB10 was an impressive operating system from the start. 10.3 added a lot of good features that make use of the Passport's screen. The Hub and the calendar are the most used features on my phone. One notable improvement is the Assistant. Voice recognition has improved significantly; I actually use it now to set appointments, alarms, play music, sent emails and texts. It's also good to see the addition of sports/movies and improved knowledge information.Android support really shines in BB 10.3. Amazon App Store is pre-loaded so that's 200,000+ apps available. There is also an app called Snap which can be loaded seperately and pulls directly from Google Play, though I only used it to get Bank of America app and ESPN Fantasy Football. For me Blackberry World apps cover 85% of what I need/use, Amazon takes care of 10% (they put up a paid app for free daily) and one-offs I download from Google Play. The Android apps run on same performance level as native apps; UI difference is the only way I can tell for sure which is running. No Google Play Services support, but that's expected.Ease of use. User Interface was designed with purpose. Context actions are there when you need them without searching all over the screen. Typing does require both hands which doesn't bother me much since I mostly typed two handed on any phone.Connectivity. It looks like BlackBerry made one model to fit as many carriers as possible. I've never seen so many bands/frequencies supported by a single phone. It is GSM. I imagine this will be useful when traveling.Overall, excellent device. Cheaper than the new IPhone and new Galaxies. With access to Android apps you are not missing out on popular apps. What makes the Passport great is the productivity features and battery life, well ahead of other phones/OS's. The Passport gives you the advantage of in-house optimization of software and hardware that the IPhone has, the advanced features and flexibility that Android users enjoy with BlackBerry organizing and streamlining those features, and has the easy access to information with the Hub and Active Frames that Windows 8 aims to achieve.BlackBerry is known for security. I'm sure security experts would have more good things to say about that.I would definitely recommend this phone to any cell phone user, not just BlackBerry fans.",2014年10月4日 在美国审核
Amazing and Flawless says the former iPhone user!,"I was an iPhone user until my BlackBerry Passport arrived! Wow. One word: Amazing. Okay, two words: Amazing, flawless.It's pretty incredible - works at a fast speed, nice selection of apps, great productivity. It's like having your laptop in your hand.The absolute only flaw that I see and it is not a problem for me - it's wide. Holding it is uncomfortable for me to use as a phone because I have small hands. However, the limited amount of time that I am on the phone and holding it to my ear is minimal, so it is a non-issue.I can't say enough about this amazing phone!Will post pics in customer images for you to see the difference in the width of the phone.",2014年10月23日 在美国审核
Wow.,"The likelihood that you will enjoy this device depends on one seriously key factor.Are you heavily ingrained into ecosystem present on Android or Apple devices?If so then this will be a much harder sell to you.If not, then let me tell you, this phone truly is amazing in almost every way.You need to take this into account when you look at the stars I have rated this device.If you can't live without your Google services then by no means is this device 5 stars for you.Everywhere I take it, no matter where I am, people comment on it.What is that?It looks cool.Hey, its got a keyboard.I miss those. Can I try it out?Its definitely a conversation starter.It helps that aesthetically, the thing is very pleasing to look at and even at closer inspection its hard to find faults in the look of the design, its build quality is top notch.If all you are after is a snappy phone that responds when you ask it to, I am here to tell you I have never used a peppier device and I have toyed with them all from Apple to Google to Microsoft.When you swipe up out of an app and tap another you are there INSTANTLY, and not just there and you need a sec for it to load before you can control it, I mean you can go from the browser to youtube or facebook and scroll instantly within them.NO slow down. Zero. It is actually very liberating and after using it, I find it hard to use my android phone.Swiping left brings up all your notifications and it puts them all in a singular list, from your email to notifications from apps to phone calls all there in a nice readable fashion.Further swiping left will allow you to filter this list to just one item if you so choose.So you could just look at a list of your email if that is your desire.Swiping up always brings you back to the home screen, which basically a pictorial list of your open apps which as I have mentioned allows you to swap between them very fast.Swiping from the right brings you to your list of installed items and further swiping brings about other pages of them.That is the interface in a nutshell.The keyboard itself doubles as a touch pad as it is touch sensitive, something which in practice feels like it should have always been this way. It really feels great to use and I think it was one of the better ideas they have had. Swiping up and down on it feels somewhat limited though because of the short distance you have to do so and sometimes I find myself going to high and activating the swipe up on screen almost causing an app to close or just swiping enough to activate the text entering portion of a web page.This can be alleviated by rotating the device on its side, but I found when doing so you feel hamstrung due to the keyboard being sideways and needing to rotate back to use it.As cool as the keyboard doubling as a track pad is, not everything seems to use it.Some apps do not recognize it, which adds a feel of inconsistency to the mix, but I only found a few instances of this.Also it works great up and down but using it side to side doesn't always correlate to what you think it would do.For instance if your zoomed in on a page and to the left, using the pad to try and go left or right doesn't always work that way, it simply does nothing.I really like that when your typing, if you want to put in a predicted word that pops up at the top you can just swipe your finger under it and it throws it in there for you.Once your used to this its easy to miss this feature elsewhere.It only has three rows of keys, which is weird because it doesn't have a number row or anything like that, even the period key is on screen when needed.Something I find odd is when I type on the keyboard there is no sound involved but when I click on a button on screen it makes an audible tone to let you know you pressed it.It makes typing seem oddly discombobulated at times, but by no means is a deal breaker.I am on Verizon and quickly learned that I was unable to use this phone through them.It does work on AT&amp;T, whom I activated it with as a go phone, and T Mobile.I think it will work with other carriers but I haven't looked any deeper than that.My current phone never really gets loud enough for my taste.I find myself holding it up to my ear to hear it.This phone does not have that problem.Its can be loud if you want it to be and I like that.The square screen does cause some issues.Games intended to be wide screen don't always play with black bars and basically extend past the sides of the screen so as to make it where you don't see the whole screen.If your not into gaming on your phone though, this won't matter to you.The battery life is holy crap good.I have used this thing for three days at a time before plugging it in.That is no joke.Heavy usage gave me two days.Seriously?Yeah.I love that about it. Though it feels odd NOT plugging it in every night.My current phone has trained me to plug it in regardless or it won't last the day the next day.This phone has caused me some trouble.One one hand I miss my Google services like listening to my streaming music, but on the other hand I want a phone that is this fast and with this kind of lasting power when it comes to battery.If this were an android device it would be a PERFECT phone to me.Since its not, its a perfect device hamstrung by the inability to use Google services.If that doesn't matter to you then I would say, go try this phone out.You won't be disappointed with it.Heck, even if it is a thing, you should still try it out.Its actually remarkable to me otherwise.",2014年11月6日 在美国审核

"Game-changer! Greatest smartphone, yet!","Wow. I can't even describe how much I love this phone! BlackBerry Passport, where have you been all my life?! I knew I wanted this from the first time I saw one, but I'm still being amazed by its genius. I was dying for the big screen, and not sure about the square format, but it's truly awesome. Especially for the Web, reading documents, WebEx, video calls...everything. The new OS is packed with fab improvements, the work-flow is incredible, and having full access to apps on Amazon's App Store and BlackBerry World closes the app-gap, nicely. Want Netflix? No problem! Oh, and the battery lasts forever and the 13 MP camera is stellar. Congrat's, BlackBerry! You have finally re-arrived! Too bad only AT&amp;T is carrying it in the US, so far.

"If it just had as protective case, it would be perfection.","I am a prepaid kind of girl.Seriously, I have a son in college and the prepaid plan only costs me $100 a year.So when I saw the unlocked Blackberry, I knew it was for me.Like everything in life, there are some pros and cons with the phone.Getting the prepaid card changed over was easy.I went down to T-Mobile and got my card changed over to the nano card the BB10 takes.The contacts were transferred over via Bluetooth.The date on the SD card would not transfer over and download unless I completely move over the card. (Which I’m in the middle of a Mobi book so the card stays until I finish.Books rule!)The apps store is via BlackBerry World and Amazon app store.You have to have an account for each one to download the apps.There is a wide selection.There is a book app that takes Mobi files for us readers in BB World.One app already loaded is the interactive tutorial lesson.I really liked the tutorial.I had played around with the phone and apps and learned a more.The tutorial explained the cursor which I like so much more than Apple’s.I do wish it had a tutorial about setting up email which I found a little confusing, but I did get it.The phone sound quality is good.I was on the road while testing and I do have T-Mobile.Even with T-Mobile limited access in the area I was in, the quality of sound was good.The phone is supposed to go to sleep when you talk so your cheek doesn’t hit buttons.My cheek would hit and put my call on speaker.I guess I was too quick.There is no butt-calling because it is locked; definite pro because my current BB Curve has that problem.My hands are small, so I feel silly like I’m putting a tablet to my ear.I guess I look like just about everybody else now.The camera is awesome.The pictures are crisp and full of color.The camera is easy to use and the photo app does slide shows.There is an edit button to Photoshop and crop.On the video, you can take still shots while filming.Then you can crop the video.This phone was delivered in time for my birthday and my trip to see my son play at a football game.I could zoom at him playing in the band.The video of the JMB was great with a good picture and sound.I cannot say enough about the camera.The keyboard took a while to get used to.My current BB Curve is smaller and easy to use.I found myself propping a lot to balance my hands around the keyboard.I also noticed that the morning I was in the hotel, the keyboard would not light up even though it was darkish in the room.I am wondering if the keyboard lighting up is connected to the clock (?).I don’t know if it was the hotel Wi-Fi’s problem or not, but the permission’s page would never come up.It comes up at my job so it does work.While trying for the permission’s page, I would get texts telling me the status of the access.Since I’m prepaid, wondered if I could stop the texts, that cost me money.The screen size is a really good size for a small tablet.Even with my 50 year-old eyes, I can see fine with reading glasses.I did load a game from the Amazon Store and I noticed the screen had problems.I have the same game on my Kindle and iPod.The game needs to be in landscape, but will not turn and remains in portrait.The drop down flashlight is very convenient.It is not an app that you have to download and hunt for.You pull it down with your finger and hit it; easy stuff.The battery life lasts all day.In fact, it has never gone under 55% with all the testing I was doing on it all weekend; and with a four hour ride one way, I was spending hours testing the apps that didn’t need wifi.The biggest problem with the phone is that Otter Box does not make a protective cover for it!The price of the BB10 is about $600 to $900 depending if it is on sale or not.This is a big deal not to be able to get a protective cover for it.Then I noticed that that BB10 gets very hot, very fast in the top right corner and I started wondering if it really needs a protective cover because it may overheat.The only covers I saw were portfolios so far.You would think Blackberry would offer a protective case of some sort (my curve did) until you can buy another.There is a temporary screen protector until I can find a new one.I would rather have an anti-glare or matte one.The price; it is high, but this is more than a phone.It is truly a mini laptop.I believe that there are apps for Word-like and Excel-like programs.If you can find a really good case for protection, it is worth the price.There is a cloud feature to find your device if lost or stolen.I know people hate on the Blackberry, but this is a really good, well thought out product.",2014年10月22日 在美国审核
"Great phone! Don't be afraid to switch from iOS, Android, Windows or an older BlackBerry OS!","I didn't buy my Passport from Amazon, I purchased mine directly from ShopBlackBerry.com when there was a $100 discount code. At the time, it was cheaper than Amazon. Now, Amazon has it priced A LOT cheaper. Anyway, I had an iPhone 4S a few years back when it debuted. I had a 3GS before that and upgraded to the 4S. When it came time to get a new phone, I wanted something different, because there was virtually no difference in experience from the 4S to the iPhone 5, other than the screen size and other minor things that didn't merit the hefty price tag. I then chose to purchase a used Z10 to try something different while not spending much and loved the BlackBerry 10 OS. I purchased the Passport brand new on April 3rd and it has just been a pleasure. The size takes a little getting used to, but so did the size on the Note series phones and the new iPhone 6 and 6+. You then realize how useful the shape of the screen is along with the keyboard. People might say that a keyboard is a step back and old technology, but don't computers still use keyboards? Plus, this is a touch capacitive keyboard. A first of its kind on a phone or anything, as far as I know. The short cuts for the keys are SO useful. There are too many to list, but one of my favorites is being able to lock the screen long pressing the K button and quickly swiping up and down on the screen to turn off the screen. To unlock, without swiping, you just press U and then ENTER. That is for those who have small hands and cannot reach the lock button. There are tons more that are pre-assigned that you could modify and even more short cuts that you could make on your own. They can be for apps, quick calling a contact or just about anything. The app situation is one that is always addressed in reviews. This phone is great whether you do or don't use that many apps or games. Most of the big names you can find in BlackBerry World. If you can't find what you need there, just look in the Amazon App store. The format of the screen is not a problem with Android apps. You can adjust how it appears on the screen by swiping from the top bezel. Once you do that, there are options of how you would like for it to appear. Now, Amazon doesn't have every single Android app that you would want. But, for those who really want them, you could side load the Google Play Store. There is also SNAP, which is basically the Google Play Store. Now, BlackBerry 10 can run close to 100% of the Android apps, just not the ones that require Google run time. It has been rumored that within the next few updates, BB10 will be capable of running Google run time. To end this long review, the keyboard is superb, the build quality is unmatched. Just watch this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYraDeOSt1s ) It is not hard to learn the OS since it is so fluid. The HUB is possibly the greatest thing about it. All of you messaging accounts in one spot. You can actually respond to a message within a message! Like inception just with messages. You can answer messages without ever leaving an app. It's just great! Don't be afraid to make the jump, because it isn't a bad change. Everyone is a lot smarter than a smart phone and can figure it out.",2015年5月14日 在美国审核

Poor Managers at the stores,"I have to say I was shocked today.

Nice / update: seamless experience,"First few days with this... Overwhelmingly positive experience.- No typos thanks to the comfortable physical keyboard. No need to suffer or send voice messages instead of just typing.- Better horizontal dimensions for the screen: no more squinting.- The size is about perfect for my hands, 1.81 m / 5 ft 11 guy, fits in all my pockets easily.- All your email, whatsapp, sms messages in a single place called Blackberry Hub, genius.- Easy, elegant navigation, takes three seconds to understand it. Easy to multitask with it.- The keyboard is also a touchpad so you can scroll without putting a finger over the screen, even if that works too: the sort of innovation Apple can only dream of.- The few android apps that don't work can be used through the web browser: google maps, wordpress.- Tons of space (32 gb), and a micro sd card slot; no stingy 16GB here.- Some odd apps do work with it: Canon's eos remote.- Beautiful, elegant device, seems very well made: looks like my macbook pro had a baby.I'd never had a Blackberry before, they seemed clunky, this is a really polished product, everything is logical and works well; this is the gold standard for all phones, whatever the future may hold for the company. And this for someone coming from a really decent Nexus 4. Of course you need to take into account the app situation, so it's not for everyone.Why get it? The thought of getting a new phone only to keep on suffering while typing on a screen pushed my decision: I'd rather putter along with my old phone. I've learned the hard way to be practical with technology and go for the most reliable device at the lowest possible price, as exemplified by the Nexus 4, 5, 5x: reliable, safe, boring choices; but I still felt like I was missing out on legendary devices like the Palm pre, Nokia N9, and the Passport is up there with the best. Crazy? Sure. Awesome? You bet.Update: week 2.- The transition from my android Nexus 4 was much quicker than I expected, thanks to the DeviceSwitch app Blackberry recommends.- Typing is a joy, text prediction is actually quick and fun, as opposed to a pain in Android (and I'm writing in three languages).- Zero typos and I'm getting quicker at writing on it.- Browsing is comfortable, I find myself reaching for my phone rather than the computer.- You can tell the Passport has been thought through and refined. Going to sleep? Just put the phone in bedside mode, it goes into battery save mode and turns off all notifications, while giving you a cool clock. You can probably do this in android but here someone thought it through for you, great.- I adapted quickly to the physical format, seems a lot less unwieldy than an iPhone 6+ which is not as wide but way taller.- Some people complain about their screens popping off, it might be a case of not sitting on your phone.- The camera works well, it's no DSLR but you can take a picture by tapping on the screen, a volume button or the keyboard's space bar - useful.- If you install Blend on your computer you can see and answer all your email, sms, whatsapp messages from your computer, and transfer files to and fro, via wifi or usb, genius.- I was forgetting a favourite: you can launch apps and other actions from the keyboard: for instance long press b and the browser opens; it's a small thing but it makes you want to reach for the phone instead of having to turn on the computer - which I also use with keyboard launchers. Long press e and the weather app opens, m for maps...Few tech gear have given me as much joy as this Blackberry Passport, and it looks gorgeous to boot.",2016年4月21日 在美国审核

Great Phone,"I ordered this phone directly from ShopBlackberry.com (Oct 3rd). I received this last week and have just started to play with it. I was a bit apprehensive that a. the phone would be heavy and b. too big.I actually found that both of this is not true for me and it feels good in my hands. I have never been a one handed typist so the two handed typing is not an issue. The tactile keyboard with built-in track pad, screen, hub, blend, battery life and apps( it covers all my needs) are all things that have surpassed my expectations.

Cast the first stone if you're without guilt.,"There have been some allegations about doctored reviews. Of course such practices should not be done, and although suspicious, I cannot irrefutably prove or disprove these. But if you think this is being done, don't you concede other phone companies may intersperse similar contrivations into their product reviews? I didn't buy this on Amazon, I went to the Telus store and tested this out against the other new phones. I mulled over it, went back to the store, bought it, and am extremely satisfied. All the positive advantages championed about the phone are true. It's just a matter of how valuable that is to you. This is a literally and figuratively solid and elegant phone that helps you use your time efficiently, not waste it, or at least waste it more efficiently :) A delight for sight, sound, and touch in all practical purposes.

Its better implemented on BB10 than anywhere else, apple even copied it along the way. But not as well. Also, having an on/off switch beside the link to the actual settings is what Im talking about. Beyond useful. Its how it should be done. Im glad they thought of it.BB10 os answers the promise of having a computer in your pocket. It has a file browser that you can move and organize all of you files. I can even browse, edit and move files on my macbook thats on the same wifi network. It blows me away that this is a feature, and that nobody talks about this. This means I can move music from my macbook, to my passport over wifi. I can decided then and there when an what I want. No iTunes. I repeat, no iTunes. Marvellous. A number of times I've download programs for my mac and PC while Im out and about, only to move them over to those machines at a later time, when I have time. Usually after I've forgotten about the app 's discovery. And its right there. On my phone. Then on my laptop via wifi, or my PC via USB. So frigging liberating!Its tough as nails. Taken quite a few spills and is littered in dings, dents ands scratches. It hasn't stopped working.The keyboard trackpad thing is pretty darned cool. Using it now to control my iMac media center.Keyboard shortcuts! Yes! Thing thing is mobile and you want at thins quickly or it gets in the way and is not useful. I've set up my shortcuts for the core OS, Hub and browser in a way that makes sense to me. Most of them weren't all that far off anyway. I hold the letter C on the keyboard and it opens calculator. I hold down i, I get the browser (internet). Its silly useful.This thing is absurdly fast. I usually have 10 to 20 webpages open at once. A youtube clip playing a track in the background with some notes about something Im working on, my calendar(which is exquisite, obviously), file browser open, my Squate Register app, another invoicing application, and a spreadsheet open, and switching between apps that I need. I can bounce from app to app really quick, and back to messaging, with copied pieces of text or data. It really is a little computer for you fingers.Apps arent a problem. If they are, I don't notice. The apps I use and need are there. But the browser is really good. I refuse to have Facebook in my hub so I've deleted it and just use the browser. No FB messenger required, if its required for bb10, I don't know. Most websites open in a decent mobile page anyway, and of they're old of clunky, i'll open it in desktop mode. Never any problems.Device manager.At least that what I think its called. This allows me to see whats using what and what on. Skype slowed my machine down for a while and I thought my passport was going the way of the iPhone. Opened up this core app, saw Skype was slowing the whole system down and killing my battery. I prevented it from starting at boot up and my woes disappeared. Its beyond useful. Can also track what apps are using you mobile or wifi data, whats killing your battery, whats using your RAM and or CPU.I have mine in the red color, it's very much gawked at by all who've never seen such an alien device. Then I gush about how much this thing fills the promises the iPhone claimed. I owned five different models along the way, and the bread-crumbing of 'features'by apple got too tiring and expensive. See; disappointing.Its a chick magnet. Dudes think its stupid, chicks dig it.Ok, so the cons.It was pretty expensive.The OS can stall from time to time.As far as OS's go, its not the prettiest girl at the dance.no complaints about the camera, don't know what the reviews were all upset about.It is big. Not really a one handed jobby.It takes some time to figure the whole thing out, but so effing worth it when you do. It's a really powerful tool and toy all wrapped up into one. I love this phone.",2016年2月14日 在美国审核
December 2016 -- but still a VERY GOOD phone,"This phone would get 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-star reviews.I bought this phone directly from Blackberry's website - It was available, apparently for a limited time, for just under $300. Before getting the Passport, I was reviewing Samsung Galaxy and an occasional HTC phone. My last Samsung Galaxy was the S5.I was used to it. I didn't load it up with a tremendous amount of stuff (and no games), but for the handful of apps that I actually used, it worked fine -- except for issues with short battery life (even with new batteries), and the funny on-screen keyboard.AT&amp;T sent my wife a Passport to replace her old Blackberry Curve (they're discontinuing 2G service and would rather give her a phone than lose her monthly service fees). I used to use Blackberry phones (I also reviewed Blackberry phones), and appreciated the keyboard, preferring the physical keyboard to the virtual ones on Android phones. However, I couldn't review Android apps on a Blackberry phone (back a few years), so I had to move to Android.Flash forward to 2016. I was tired of having to replace batteries on my Galaxy S5 at the least opportune times. When I occasionally traveled, I didn't want to carry a spare, charged battery. I saw reviews of the Passport that touted much longer battery life.My wife suggested that I'd prefer a Passport over my Samsung Galaxy. Boy, was she right.I like the larger screen. I like having a physical keyboard. Without doing heavy computing on it, I occasionally run the battery down to below 20%.I've been something of a geek for the past 20+ years, and like challenges, so making this phone work very much like the Android phones that I left was a challenge that I willingly took on. Using the stuff from Cobalt (find his feed on CrackBerry), I was soon able to install Google Play apps that Snap didn't always do well with. Using a program converter that was one of the things Cobalt included, I was able to remove the 'requires Google Play Services' message on a number of apps. I also used an APK grabber that let me grab the native APK files from the Play store so that they can be filtered and recompiled to remove the Google Play message.Not all Android apps work on the Passport, but I knew this going in. In some cases, there are Amazon or Blackberry World versions of the same apps - I load those before even considering a Google Play version -- they've already been designed to work.I'm disappointed that the documentation doesn't cover all my questions or all the steps and shortcuts. Better support would have been nice but, OTOH, the Samsung documentation and support weren't all that helpful, either.I like the 32 GB of native storage - I don't hit a wall on the Passport like the one that I used to hit on my Galaxy. I've added a 128GB smart card, and don't expect storage to be a problem for quite a while. The fast processor and 3 GB of RAM make this a nice, fast phone.I'm liking the Blackberry Hub - built into the phone, and letting you see messages, mail, text, and social media activity on one central hub. You can drill down into messages from within the hub.I've just enabled Blackberry Blend -- a nifty application that connects your phone to your computer or tablet. Blend lets me see what's happening on the phone. I can use the keyboard and mouse on my computer and update whatever is on the hub. It's a LOT easier to create texts, update calendars, produce e-mails, and do other basic tasks, using the computer than it is on the Passport (although the Passport also makes these things much easier than on an Android phone). I don't know of any Android apps that are equivalent to Hub or Blend. KIES does some of the Blackberry Link tasks - but I've always found it clunky to use and not especially powerful.My wife and I have had our own frustrations with our Passports. Sometimes the gestures on the screen are not easy to accurately produce. For some reason, my wife's Passport produces a sound when there's an incoming text message - although our notification settings are the same, my Passport just WON'T do anythng besides buzz at me.Perhaps my biggest issue with the phone may be a non-issue with other users. I use a flip cover - it's a nice, leather, OEM cover. When it's closed, the screen blanks. When opened, the screen lights up. It's a nice way to shut the display off when it's not needed.HOWEVER - I carry this phone in my right front pants pocket. I usually have keys in the pocket at the same time. All too often, even though there's a fairly thick piece of leather between car keys and phone keyboard, keys are often pressed while the phone is in my pocket. This hasn't been disastrous for me, but it IS annoying -- and perhaps the price that I have to pay for carrying a phone with a keyboard next to a set of keys.I'm a bit concerned about the battery in this phone. Even though the phone is new, straight from the manufacturer, I'm concerned that the battery's useful life may be slightly less than it would have been for one that was purchased when the phone first hit the market. I'm hoping that this will last a LONG, LONG time. The battery is sealed inside the stainless steel shell, and it may be a tremendous pain to open the phone to replace the battery, if the phone eventually needs battery replacement.Build quality is good -- the phone is supposed to be cut out of a solid block of stainless steel. For my large hands, the size isn't an issue. This phone is SOLID.I'm continuing to learn more about OS10 -- and in the nearly two months since I got the phone, there have been two firmware upgrades. Blackberry hasn't completely abaondoned this phone or the Operating System.I've used this to watch SlingTV - the picture IS smaller than on an Android phone, but stilll viewable. The browser is good and text is much moe readable. Reading and sending texts and e-mails is much easier than it was on the Android phone because the Passport's screen is large and very clear, and you probably won't have to fiddle with screen magnification like you may have to do on an Android phone.Phone voice quality is very good. For music and other audio, the speakers are loud and sound quite good.If you have a wired pair of headphones, this phone can be used as an FM radio.In short, I really like this phone. The more I use it, the easier it will probably be to use it. I keep finding shortcuts and things I can do to make it easier to use.I may even consider buying a backup -- because it doesn't appear that any other phone makers will come out with physical keyboards - and because this phone provides a high level of security, does well as a phone, does an admirable job with work-related tasks, and is, for the most part, a real joy to use. I don't anticipate returning to an Android phone, with its strange form factor, limited security, lack of a physical keyboard, and limited battery life.Yes. It's December 2016. This phone has been out for quite a while. It's too bad Blackberry marketing wasn't strong enough to get the word out on this very good phone. Even when compared to this month's new phones (do we get new announcements every month, or does it just seem that way?), the Passport hold up very well.",2016年12月20日 在美国审核
The passport is the best blackberry ever made in my opinion big size screen ...,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xKrx9GrnDcReview from a business photographer and consumer. The passport is the best blackberry ever made in my opinion big size screen and keyboard is the perfect combination the keyboard is different than what us blackberry users are a custom too but with that said you will adjust with ease.When I had my q10 I would carry around my iPad mini to display my photos to my clients and when I would travel with my family I would use it to watch movies now with the passport I really only need to bring one device and not lug around my iPad with me. The passport screen is nice to display my photos and nothing beats a big screen to watch movies so when your at home or in a hotel room you can connect your passport to the tv with an hdmi connector but if your traveling by train, airplane or bus the passport screen is just fine to watch movies or YouTube videos. Also there is a native app called igrann that works just like Instagram only thing it can't do is direct message or uploadyour own video if those 2 things are important to you than you can download the android instagram app in less than a minute and you will have all the instagram features. all the smartphones out are good phones the gap as really been closed so if you dare to be different and you get the blackberry passport just know you are not downgrading.Hope you enjoy and I hope my opinion was helpful",2014年10月16日 在美国审核
Goodbye Android! Hello BlackBerry!!!,"We all thought BlackBerry was gone, we all had switched to iPhone or Android, but no one thought they would switch back to BlackBerry, especially myself. I went from a Bold 9000 to iPhone then Android and never thought I would go back to BlackBerry, it seemed so outdated. I want from a Bold to a iPhone 3g to 4 to 5 to Samsung GS5, LG G3, Note 4 and iPhone 6 plus and none, I REPEAT NONE of them are as good as my new Passport. This is the first phone I am truly satisfied with. And the MAIN REASON, usability and productivity. If phone quality, texting, emails, facebooking, and web browsing are important to you, look no further trade in your phone and get this blackberry. BlackBerry has retrieved a customer, and I will continue to use their products if they keep up this amazing trend. Oh, and one last comment, Samsung, LG and even Apple, look to the blackberry in terms of build quality this product will last.",2015年5月3日 在美国审核

Welcome to Corporate Class!!,"8/17-so still using the BB passport as my daily driver in August 2020!??!?? why? well apart for the incredible call quality, the antennae- this this thing never drops calls..never!! the keyboard! the speakers are fantastic, the BB10 of course- it is so nice not having a phone operating system mine your data 24/7 this phone respects the user of course because BB is not a US company..Updated 2/7/2020!!! man i miss this phone i upgraded to the key2 but hate having my data compromised every day because even though it has dtech and that is great but at the end of the day it is run on google OS so the user is being mistreated and worse yet the user is paying to be mistreated.to the folks on the fence....Sure 600.00 is a LOT of cash to invest in a phone you could easily buy a nice laptop for that kind of money.But after you bite the bullet and bring the phone in to your local AT&amp;T/T-mobile provider- you won't get hit with a lot of the extra fee's(activation fee etc) you typically would spend if you purchased in a Store.I'll keep this review very short as others have already done an outstanding job with their feedback(I've read many of them) having owned this phone for about 2 weeks I do not at all miss my HTC Droid DNA and that god awful HTC SyncManager Software.Blackberry's MediaSync is fast, responsive, and just works.As others have stated you really can tell the difference on the web(very fast)The call quality also is amazing along with the keyboard makes you want to text even if you typically have never enjoyed the exercise.The battery is stout!!One last thing about this phone is most people still haven't heard or seen this device- i get people all the time asking me where they can get one. The bluetooth is a little buggy but wiling to overlook that and hopefully with newer OTA updates that will resolve itself- 2 Big Thumbs up Blackberry- excellent product!!",2014年12月21日 在美国审核

"It's smooth like butter, which is great","Prior to reading this review, you should know that I've been an avid Blackberry user for the past 8 years. I still remember when I peeled of the plastic of my first Bold. Magnificent. Blackberry passport is essentially the equivalent of Windows Vista. It all has this power but it seems that they forgot the basics which is user experience. It's smooth like butter, which is great, but holding your phone is quite sad actually. The phone size is way too large, and does not fit in regular pockets, or in car holders, or even some suit pockets. I know Blackberry is trying to go for a business appeal, but this might be too big of a push. Prior to buying this phone, please check out the thickness as well as a comparison to any phone out there. I have the OnePlus One (which is a big push from the Q10), but this is essentially Blackberry's equivalent of the Samsung Note.",2014年12月1日 在美国审核
"Great phone, but willingness to hack required.","Where do I begin. Alright, the keyboard is unusual. But that's about it. As a phone, it's very solidly built. It weighs the part, has a nice 1440x1440 screen, and the usual connectivity and then some (Quad-Band GSM, Hexa-Band UMTS, Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11-AC WiFi with Miracast capability, and an impressive 10-band LTE Radio, which not many phones come close). The CPU is a modest Snapdragon 32-bit quad-core with Adreno 3D graphics (an 801-AA for all you geeks out there), but it has an impressive 3GB of work RAM and 32GB storage, storage expandable by MicroSD card to up to 128GB in size. It even has stereo speakers around the bottom. And these aren't really cheap speakers either- they really do sound impressive despite the size.Software-wise, the phone came out of the box with Blackberry-10 10.3.0. It has since been upgraded to 10.3.2. This impressive OS has Android compatibility and to prove the point, it comes with both Blackberry World for Blackberry native apps and Amazon's Appstore for Android titles. It's Android support isn't a full 100%, but good enough that most games and apps run flawlessly on it. What are the few that doesn't? Apps that require heavy 3D rendering. It's not that these apps don't run tho- it's just that they have the tendency to freeze. Thankfully the freezes are getting much less with every subsequent OS upgrade. Aside from that Apps that requires Google's Service Framework may refuse to run as well, which may be a problem to some folks.Which brings me to my second point: ownership of this phone requires a brave heart and willingness to hack. Blackberry isn't like Apple or Samsung, they release their OS based on what provider you're on- which causes issues if you're on a provider that doesn't have good relationship with Blackberry (I'm looking at you, DiGi Malaysia!). The SIM card you put into your phone dictates whether you get an update or not regardless of whether your phone is factory unlocked. Blackberry themselves suggests that the phone can be updated if you pull the SIM card and restart if it's a factory unlocked phone, but that adds to the hassle. The other way is to learn to use unauthorized tools like Sachesi to upgrade the phone, which may be a better deal since Sachesi allows you to spoof your phone's operator, and some operators get better firmware than even the ones Blackberry themselves put out, and sooner too (for example, if you're on one of the several Canadian operators, you are getting 10.3.2.2339. If you're in the US, you're stuck with an an older 10.3.2.858 instead. And if you're in some parts of Asia, you're stuck with 10.3.1, of which the earlier versions has a nasty video driver glitch that causes the screen to flicker green). And yes, if you can hack that, you can install hacked versions of apps so that they don't require the Google Services Framework to run, and even the Google Play Store.All in all, it's a nice phone. Wonderful connectivity, excellent screen, feels solid, and even runs Android apps. However, Blackberry could do better and make the firmware uniform across all devices instead of determining who gets what based on their telco. That method's just rubbish.",2015年8月14日 在美国审核
occasionally using it for email and texting and it easily lasted the whole trip,"I've given myself 3 weeks to get used to this phone. I bought it used locally because they are constantly sold out.This phone is a blast to use. Recent trip I never plugged it in for 2 days... occasionally using it for email and texting and it easily lasted the whole trip. I realized recently that I can get any app functionality I want just by shortcutting a service's website. Gasbuddy, Stocktwits... almost anything.And the browsing experience... my god. Blazing fast. One of the biggest peeves to browsing on a phone is how slow it can be (I also own a 5S, and its horrid and annoying to browse seriously or do any type of multi-tab research). This thing chews through browsing like baby food.Ive never been a blackberry user before. It took me 2 solid weeks to get used to the keyboard but I am now very very quick and accurate on it and it is very satisfying to use. I have large hands and can type out short messages with one hand despite the form factor.In a choice between this and the iPhone 6 Plus, I saw no competition.Reason one: It fits in my damn pocket without sticking out like a ruler.Two: The Hub makes it possible (and fun!!??) to sort and check allll my email, twitter, facebook, and business accounts. This is the MAIN thing that makes this phone such a great tool for business. Doing business on an iPhone is HELL.Three: Built like a tank.Four: Love using Google maps on this. I didn't realize how awesome navigation would be on a square screen (I use nav daily).Five: Battery life. 2-3 days. Need I say more?After a week, the form factor is never awkward. The typing experience is very very good.Only con is that some Android apps seem to crash a lot, but I found that most of them I can access through the browser and it would be faster than the native app on my iphone.Buy it dammit.

BlackBerry is back in REAL business!,"I didn't purchase my Blackberry Passport from Amazon but I will give it a review for those who are on the fence about this phone. First, this is a business phone!Not typically aimed for those who are looking for a phone to play games or watch movies even though you can do both on this device it's mainly geared towards production to get business done. Emails are great reading and composing, editing is even better. With a 128 gig SD card support, you can be certain to have all your important files, photos to store or send with confidence. Social media like Facebook, Twitter works flawlessly with no connection issues.The HUB is the jewel of this device in my opinion where all your accounts can be viewed in one place without having to go from app to app. The device is intended for two hand operation where it feels good holding it with both hands. The typing on physical to virtual keyboard will take some getting use to but in a day or so you will find yourself typing away and in my case even faster than on my old phone with a virtual keyboard.This phone is a powerhouse for getting business done, it's not made for everyone who's looking for a ""vanity in style"" phone for they will be disappointed. But if you are the type of person where your communications dealing with emails, sending files and the like then you're gonna love thisphone!",2015年9月16日 在美国审核
Best Smart Phone Out There,"I upgraded to the Passport Silver Edition last year from a Blackberry Bold. I have owned Blackberry's since 2005 so... yes. I am a devoted crackberry fan. I refuse to give up my 60 WPM proficiency on Blackberry's proprietary QWERTY keyboard. And why should I? This phone is utterly amazing for many, many other reasons. It has a MONSTER battery that lasts for two days under heavy use without recharging. The ""Blackberry Hub"" brings all of my email accounts and texts into one easy inbox. It communicates effortlessly with my laptop to sync my calendar and shared documents. The screen is amazingly big with spectacular resolution - perfect for viewing videos or reading documents. The camera is outstanding and better than IPhone. Important to me, the speaker phone is loud and clear. Many more features that you can read about. For me this is the perfect phone and I hope Blackberry continues to make them.On the down side (for others but not for me), the Blackberry Passport does not operate strictly on an ""android"" or ""iPhone"" platform. Therefore, some of the dubiously helpful (mostly time-waster &amp; marketing tracer) apps cannot be easily downloaded to this phone.Fine with me. I'd rather be doing business and taking notice of my surroundings than sticking my face in my phone checking Tinder every minute. This is an adult phone. For adults.",2016年9月14日 在美国审核
Definitely worth a try!,"The phone is amazing! When I first received it I felt it was too big (it is reeaally big, I've never really liked ""phablets"") but I got used to it quickly. I was a loyal BB customer (Bold 9000 among others) but I changed for an Android because of all the apps, Android,etc. At the beginning I was missing the phyisical keyboard but after seeing the phones Blackberry was releasing (Q5, Z10...) I thought I would never buy a Blackberry again.One or two years later, I came up to this phone. I was reluctant at the beginning, but with the option of returning it, I decided to test it, and I love it!Best:- The screen. Despite this weird 1:1 shape, the quality is amazing and does not harm your eyes.- Blackberry Hub, it's perfect for me (many email accounts, jsut 1 per social network).- Physical keyboard's pad. Blackberry has introduced some very smart feautres on the keyboard that allow you to write smoothly.- Software, it has surprised me actually. I thought it was going to be the worse part of the device, but it's actually almost the best. Everything flows, is intuitive and is nicely presented.- Battery. Not amazing but will last a day eeeasy, if you don't use it too much and especially with the battery saver mode can bet the two days mark. Today, I woke up at 8 am with the battery fully charged, I have been using it pretty much, music included, and it is still at 56% (it's 10 pm). My previous Samsung (S4 Mini) usually died at 3-4 pm with the same use (I have to say the Samsung was almost 1'5 years old and this one is brand new).Worse:- Apps. Blackberry world, Amazon app store are good, but waaaay ahead of the play store (out of 10 apps that I tried to find at amazon I didn't find more than 3 or 4). ALTHOUGH, you can download from the web an app called Snap that allows you to download any app form the google store. Some of then will not be fully compatible (notifications especially) and some won't open (Uber! couldn't believe that Uber does not have a native BB app - play store's does not work) and Google apps (Drive, Maps, Gmail, Keep, etc.) will not work at all (this is the main issue for me - Google drive was important for me).- Keyboard: The keyboard is really good, but it's too compressed. Not having an alt &amp; a shift stroke is a huge mistake in my opinion. I would substitute part of the screen by some extra space in the keyboard that would make the spacebar biggger and include these two.- Size. It is really big, it catches people's attention (Wow, so big, do blackberry phones still exist? :O )So in conclusion, if you are missing your old Blackberry, despite having some cons, you should definitely buy this beauty. The day it arrived the first thing that came to my mind was returning it back. However, in just a couple days, I became used to it. It's not a phone for the average user, but for our niche I think it is the device that fulfills perfectly our needs.Hope this was helpful!",2015年4月25日 在美国审核
Fantastic phone. Get it.,"I have had the phone for a week, so if anything changes, I will update. I have been using windows phones for years, so my comparison will mostly mention windows OS as a comparison.To get straight to it, the phone is amazing. BB10 software is as great as I thought it would be. The hub, ease of adding new email accounts, mail updating quickly, being able to search through ALL of my email (there is a lot) and have those search results return quickly was essential.The screen is superb. It is very bright, great resolution, and I love that I can adjust the color to eliminate some of the blues (which help out my eyes).Construction is great, all metal. Not many phones offer that, so its pretty nice to have. Feels solid and comfortable in your hand. When I'm paying $550 for a phone, I would like it feel and look of good quality, not a piece of plastic.I was on a blackberry years ago and switched to windows. So coming back to blackberry, I am finding out how much I missed the keyboard, and little things like the notification LED. That will end up saving me a lot of time in the long run, since I dont have to pick up and wake up my phone anymore to see if I've missed anything.The touch keyboard is such a good idea. There are shortcuts on it as well when you're browsing the web like T for top of page, B for bottom, etc. This is so handy. I use the web A LOT, for various things, so this is very nice. Scrolling with the keypad is easy, requires less motion, and keeps my hand off the screen. Typing is, as you can imagine, faster, more accurate, and the autocorrect has been great. It remembers my emails, my last name. My lumia 1020 did not.Browsing experience has been fantastic. Some pages load almost instantly. I have not encountered pages that didnt work properly, and in fact, there was one page that hardly worked on my windows phone, but on the BB works exactly as it does on the computer.And to comment on it again, having all accounts in one place is awesome (the HUB).Having the ability to use android apps is pretty useful. I am not an app person, but there are a few I use.No issues with call quality. The speakers are pretty fantastic, and I will actually use them to listen to things now.Cons:CAMERA!! BB has always had s***ty cameras. I take a lot of pictures. I travel, I have dogs, and capturing a good picture is really important. As such, I am coming from the Lumia 1020, which is the best camera to date on a phone. So I dont expect the BB to have something that good, but I am not a fan so far. To be honest, I have only taken a couple pictures, so once I return home, I will try it out on the dogs. But so far, I almost find myself avoiding to take pictures because of it. Not that many controls for the camera that I am used to, and no dedicated camera button. But I understand and knew going into it, I wasnt buying this to replace or even compare to the lumia 1020, it was to make work more streamlined and efficient.Second big con is that it is not really a one-handed phone. I am used to using and typing with one hand. I move around, drive, etc. This is difficult to type one handed and while driving.No glance screen like on lumia 1020OS similar to android and apple with grid of appsCannot modify homepage or the tiles on the homepage (please correct me if I'm wrong)No live tiles (yes, its a windows thing, but coming from windows, it is a nice thing)Bluetooth keeps disconnecting. I don't know if its a compatibility issue with my headset or not, I still need to call motorola. It seems like the phone is doing it though. It's pretty annoying, but doesn't happen all the time. if I need to getnew headset it is no big deal. Having a poorly connecting headset in no way diminishes the phone.Bottom line: The phone rocks, and I am glad to be back on blackberry. Email, messaging, and internet experience have all improved. I still carry my nokia around and use nokia maps (best out there), and the camera though.",2015年9月14日 在美国审核
BlackBerry Passport - What A Surprise!,"I have my Red BlackBerry Passport in my hand. It is absolutely gorgeous and it has a solid quality feel about it. When you turn it on, the screen is striking. Browsing across this displays gives you this wide expansive feel.Everything about it seems purposeful in design and I love the capacitive keyboard as you can use it to move around.Coming from a full touch screen cell phones, I was originally apprehensive, but you've got to love this keyboard which serves a dual purpose, as a touch pad.It is a productivity tool designed for the busy professional for sure. Although, I am still getting use to the keyboard, I am certain that in a week or two, I can get much more done than before.Although, I can watch movies on the Passport but I'll most likely do it with it connected to my wide screen TV. I have never heard better audios coming from another cell phone, a solid 10 to BlackBerry Passport for this function.To sum it up, it is, for the time being, The Best Mobility tool that money can buy. If you can, try get it free for Christmas.I would recommend Red for the ladies, wink, from a man with small hands. I have got to suppress this smug feeling before showing it off to to my Android and iOS friends. BlackBerry has laid a strong foundation, a platform, for a new revolutionary generation of Apps meant for professionals!",2014年12月9日 在美国审核
Incompatible with  El Capitan and Sierra,"I purchased this from Blackberry directly. I have used an Iphone for the past few years, but have missed the productivity and the outstanding keyboard of BB devices. I previously owned a 9900, which was a stellar device and the Z10. Having used the iphone for a few years, it is a good phone, but I missed the shortcuts, the keyboard and higher functionality of the BB. When BB had a sale going on, I jumped.Pros - Absolutely beautiful device. Stunning industrial design, beating any other device. Apple should take cues from the passport. I received countless compliments on what a good looking device it is (which is however not the reason I purchased it)Keyboard - pleasure to type on. Takes a while getting used to (coming from iOs), but once you get the hang of it is is great. Predictive text works better than iphone or android.Cons:Crashes and boots up around once a day. This is for mundane tasks, like reading the New York Times on the browser.Impossible to operate one-handed. I know that this was raised on many videos and I realize why, but you become so used to all the other phones that can be operated one handed. This device cannot - not even to enter your password. You must use both hands at all times. This is tiring after while.DEALBREAKER: You cannot back up this device to the Mac OS El Capitan or Sierra. I spent a good 30 minutes with BB tech support and while they were nice, admitted it was a technical issue with that OS with no indication that it would be fixed. I am willing to forgo the less ergonomic feel when holding this larger device, the lack of apps (I don't use FB or Twitter anywasy), but not being able to back up my data? Ever? That will not work.It's a shame, because it is a beautiful device. And I sit here looking at it, debating whether I should just keep it - it feels really, really good. But there is no way I can keep it if I cannot have data backup - this is so fundamental to blackberry, that is is so odd they would not want to fix it ASAP. Maybe it's because Mac users are a fraction of a fraction.So if you have a Windows computer, don't use social apps, use it primarily as a phone (great phone btw) and to amalgamate all your messages - it's a great device.If you have a Mac, sadly - think twice.",2016年10月17日 在美国审核
Best device for a person looking to be productive,"It is by far the best mobile device that I have used. Coming from iphone5 and 6plus (which are great phones), I must say I was surprised how easy it was for me to get used to gestures on OS. Typing is great in a physical keyboard, much better than on glass. Using BB10 OS is secure and gives me a lots of controls of what data I allow/want to share, nothing is hiden. I use my phone to ream and send lots of emails and attachments that I need to edit or read. Phone app is great and has clear sound, I put people on speaker and they have no problem hearing me and at the same time I can take notes, search web or edit document with no problems. I don't play games on this phone and all apps that I need I can get in BBstore or load any android app. When first received it took some time to get used to size of the phone, it is not too big but no small either, just different, but got used to it pretty fast. Phone build from quality materials and it can be seen and felt one you pick it up (already dropped it 3 times and not even a scratch). I usually put it in my jeans back pocket and have no problem fitting it there. Overall I am very happy that I got this phone. Recommend for everybody to try something different and I am sure you will like it. Phone is fast and does everything with no lag. about cameras, focus is a bit slow but take good pictures. Front camera is good as well. I am of the opinion that if you want good pictures you should use camera for it and not all-in-one device. In any case love the phone and will recommend to anyone.",2016年1月1日 在美国审核

The best device I've ever used and I've used them all.,"I've been using this device since launch and can say that this is the best phone out there!The touch enabled keyboard is AMAZING and is awesome in landscape mode on the browser and Facebook.The device is sooo fast and the battery life is amazing.I can go 2 days without charging this thing and that's checking emails, checking Facebook, listening to podcasts/music and running all kinds of apps.The addition of the Amazon app store is awesome.It grows the app ecosystem by a few hundred thousand apps and pretty much every app I've downloaded works just fine.Should also mention that the BlackBerry Assistant (BlackBerry Siri) is better then Siri where as it brings you right to the website instead of just showing you links available.It will actually search Amazon for a particular item and show you the results right away.The screen on this thing is incredible!It's so bright and vibrant and I can have 8 apps running at the same time without any lag at all!VERY impressed with this device.BlackBerry is listening to it's customer's and making their new devices with them in mind.Can't recommend this highly enough.Should also mention I dumped by Galaxy Note 2 for this and not looking back at all!!!",2014年10月8日 在美国审核
What a great phone!,"Honestly, the BlackBerry has been fun to figure out.The OS is super efficient, and since it is such a strong messaging platform, you can tell that it's where the focus is when using it.Triaging email is a pleasure, and the battery is unbelievable.The OS is nothing like it used to be on my 1st BlackBerry that I had years ago, so it's been like learning something brand new which I like to do anyway.I can see where people wouldn't like it as much as an Android or iOS phone though.It isn't really designed for video and games.It plays both nicely, but it has a square screen which isn't ideal for either, really.It's also lacking in some of the trendy current apps, and although it runs Android apps some of them don't play as well with the OS as they should.It's big and it's heavy but I don't think I'd want to punch out an email or other professional communication on anything else at this point.The keyboard is that good.Since reading (which it is fantastic for) and communications are really what I use my phone for 95% of the time it's ideal for me.It also tough.I accidentally threw it on the floor at home (missed my pocket), and not a scratch on the phone, but it dented my hardwood floor.The frame of the phone is stainless and not aluminum, so that's probably why.Switched to the Passport from a Nexus 5, so I'm no fanboy, this phone just appealed to me and I'm glad I made the switch.",2014年12月5日 在美国审核
"The BEST Smartphone on the market, PERIOD!","The BEST Smartphone on the market, PERIOD!Wow, what can I say... just WOW! This phone is not only the BEST Blackberry ever made, may also be the BEST PHONE ever made! At least it's the best phone to purchase at the moment (specially if you want to buy an unlocked model)...1.Most reviewers have highlighted the Battery, it's freaking AWESOME. I was sick and tired of my iPhone 5 dying on me by 2-3pm, and this thing literally can last even 2 days, basically if you charge your phone at night, you would NEVER need to worry about a plug-in, charger, USB, etc... that's not possible with any other phone in the market today.2. Blackberry 10, is simply amazing! They didn't market it well in the past, but it's amazingly fast, has an true multi-tasking (play youtube on the background and read your emails), and the gestures, the swipe up/down and many innovative things they did was actually copied by Apple!3. HUB! I have no idea how did I live without the Hub, now I can literally keep track of all of my notification in ONE PLACE. No need to launch one app after another after another, to reply on FB, Twitter, Email, Gmail, Hotmail, Instagram, Whatsapp, BBM, etc... they're ALL IN ONE PLACE. It's genius!4. Amazon Android App Store. This is the KICKER, while BB in the past lacked some popular apps like Instagram, they're all there now today via Amazon Store which is bundled with the phone5. Camera is fantastic, 13MP, optical image stabilization (missing in iPhone 6), and a great flash.6. Build quality, fit and finish, how it looks and material used are top-notch, solid stainless steel that does NOT BEND, high quality material all around and it just looks FANTASTIC! This phone WOWS, and literally everyone asks me what's this phone wherever I go. iPhone is so 2012!7. Last but not least, it's the AMAZING screen, wow, I was first worried about Square screen, but it's fantastic. If you read a lot, text a lot, email a lot, or just read the web a lot, you gotto TRY THIS... it's absolutely amazing, you don't need a table no more, don't need to scroll, and the screen resolution and pixel density is better than iPhone 6, fantastic!I'd say the only downside of the phone maybe it's width, and harder to use in one-hand, but that's the case with most bigger phones these days, otherwise this phone is PERRFECT, and it's by far the BEST PHONE to buy today, PERIOD!",2014年10月1日 在美国审核
"Outstanding Phone With Very Thoughtful, Amazing Design","This is my all time favorite phone, and it is obvious why this phone has received awards for industrial design excellence.I previously used the AT&amp;T version, and the SE has a higher-quality look, a more responsive keyboard, better speaker, and an improved antenna (I get great reception with four or five bars most of the time).The square screen is ideal for viewing longer emails and web pages, and the capacitive keyboard works like a trackpad, making it very easy to use the cursor.The predictive word feature in the new software release is amazing its ability to predict specific and relavant words.With the new BlackBerry 10, you can assign a different color to the flashing LED notification light for each email and media account.Most of the apps that I need are on the Amazon App Store or BlackBerry World, although there are a still a few missing ones like Uber, which is why I have a second phone (an iPhone).I highly recommend adding the BlackBerry Passport SE case, from BlackBerry, as it adds very little bulk, protects the device, and allows you to see the flashing LED notification light.Battery life is good for all day under heavy use, and multiple days under light use.If you are using the device for hours on a long flight, you will run out of battery life eventually, but still excellent battery life.Phone quality is outstanding, and I have had no issues with the AT&amp;T network or connecting to it.The only negatives of the phone are the lack of a replaceable battery (not signficant given the great battery life) and while the keyboard has the perfect weight and feel, and even though the SE version has a slightly narrower keyboard as compared to the original and AT&amp;T versions, it is still a wide keyboard, and a narrower keyboard is a little better ergonomically and would be one advantage of the BlackBerry Classic or Q10.I have used the Classic in the past and liked it, but the Passport by comparison has a better screen, noticably faster processor, and longer battery life.They are both great devices and my Passport SE is currently my daily driver.I you are concerned about the cost of needing a second iPhone for certain apps like Uber, on AT&amp;T you can add a second device to your plan via a second SIM card for a low monthly cost.Regarding the BlackBerry 10 operating system, BlackBerry just released a new update as noted above, and they seem committed to now to keep the software platform going.I tried the Priv, and strongly prefer BlackBerry 10 due to the fluid and effiient handling of email, implementation of BlackBerry Hub, bullet-proof reliability, and given the fact that it is the one operating system that my company doesn't require a separate add-on security app/overlay for, all of which are why BlackBerry 10 is the perfect email and calendar interface for Microsoft Outlook.I bought my Passport SE's directly from BlackBerry due to special pricing at the time.I have bought other BlackBerry's from Amazon.With the announcement of TCL buying BlackBerry's phone licensing, hopefully they will continue with a future version of this design, although with its current processor, 3 GB of RAM, and 4G LTE, it is plenty fast as it is, even with large files.",2017年1月7日 在美国审核
10 Things,"There are plenty of detailed reviews about the pros and cons of this device, and I won't repeat what has already been written. Instead I like to mention 10 things that I have experienced in the week that I have owned this.In no particular order:1. The phone feels substantial and the size takes a while to get used to. It has taken me 3-4 days to find a comfortable holding+typing position for this phone, and now that I have, typing on the keyboard is just a joy. The speed of typing isn't faster than an Android or iOS device (I have owned several of these over the years), but the number of errors are greatly reduced. This matters much more than I thought it would: typing on a touchscreen was full or errors, followed by autocorrect errors. Having to go back, delete, and re-insert corrected text is not just tedious, it also upsets your flow of thought. With this phone, this is not longer an issue, and it makes such a big difference to the experience.2. Speaking of size, it fits well in the pocket of my shirt, but if I wear a shirt with no pockets, it is not the most comfortable to have in the pocket of my pants. Not a deal-breaker for me though.3. It looks beautiful, and is well made. Very sturdy in my hands, and docking it in bedside mode at night, it turns into a helpful clock.4. Battery life is amazing. I have charged it twice in the week I've had it. It will require more charges when I travel, but can easily make it through the day. No more panic searches for an outlet at meetings or airports.5. Blackberry made a big deal about working ""wide"". I think this feature might be a bit over-rated for me. It is certainly nice to have and it makes viewing email and documents easier, but not so much for videos.6. The Hub is just fantastic. Gone are the days of having to install a different ""app"" (and having to remember the idiosyncrasies of each app) for every email account and chat service I use. Everything shows up in one place and it works consistently. Another example of not having to context switch every time you are doing largely similar things.7. Notifications - this has been another pleasant surprise. For example, I don't have to read every unread message for the notification light to go off - just the fact that I have checked my hub and seen there are unread messages is enough to keep the light off. I'm sure there are ways to do this in the Android and iOS world, but I have more important things to do with my life. It is nice that BB just gets that right.8. The OS is smooth, and while the swiping takes a while to get used to, once you are there, it becomes second nature. There are plenty of tutorials on the phone that are helpful. The keyboard has several useful shortcuts, the browser is fast, BB Assistant is reasonably good, Maps works well enough. Having Blend on a desktop is very convenient.9. Camera is average. It takes a bit of time to focus, especially indoors. Outdoor shots are good.10. The ""app situation"" has not been an issue for me so far - the phone comes with Amazon's app store and I've tried an app here and there, but for all I need, Blackerry's built in apps, and those available on BB World have not made me miss anything (yet).Bottom line: Blackberry knows how to make phones that handle email, messages, with the use of keyboards, and this phone comes with all the modern touches that I have wanted. They have made a phone and an OS that tries to simplify and manage my workflow in a way that is intuitive and convenient.BB are not the force they once were, but the lessons they learned from back then are fully evident. The Passport is a modern phone with all the touches from Blackberries from the past that matter. Even in a week, it feels more than an extension of my workflow and life, than any Android or iPhone ever did. That is what technology should aim to be.*** Update 1 month later:Reduced my original 5 star rating to 4 stars. Having been on the road a few times with this phone, have noticed a few issues with the experience - none of which are deal breakers by any means. But here goes anyway:- Sometimes the phone gets a little hot, say when left in my car's glovebox for 30 minutes, or when running the Maps app sometimes. A reboot seems to fix this.- Speaking of Maps, it has had some trouble getting a route on a couple of occasions even thought it has worked well most of the time. So it is not as robust as Google's map offering, but has a much more saner user interface that does not change every time there is an update.- Speaking of updates, it seems like Blackberry is starting to focus on Android phones with the newly released Priv. I hope this does not mean the end of BB10. Time will tell.P. S. I still don't miss the apps.",2015年10月17日 在美国审核
"Terrific, awesome phone with slight limitations","Here's the deal.I own the ATT version of this phone, which I got from ATT and not Amazon.So this review applies to this odd version of the phone.FIrst let me say that I came back to BB from the iPhone, which I grant you is a phenomenal phone.I bought a BB Q10 from Amazon and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread.It wasn't long before I got wind of the Passort, which intrigued me.Long story short, I was all set to buy the Passport from Amazon when my wife, bless her heart, came waltzing in the door with two new phones, a new iPhone for her and a new Passport for me.So there you have it.The construction is beautiful.This is a solid phone and it feels solid in your hands.It's not at all cheap or chintzy.The ATT version has slightly rounded corners, which doesn't impact the functionality of the phone in any way, so why they did is a mystery.Just to be different, I guess.However, there are virtually zero accessories that work with this phone.That's a bummer because BB accessories are pretty cheap.So, if you want the ATT version, then you're stuck with their really sucky holster thingie and that's about all.You won't find a ton of game apps in the BB app store for this phone.Or media apps. Or any entertainment apps at all.For me, this was not big deal since I don't play games on my phone.Or watch movies.What is a big deal is the lack of streaming audio apps.I stream music/talk radio all day and all the really good streaming radio apps are not available for BB.Also a total bummer is that Audible.com no longer supports the BB.I am an audiobook addict and this was a major let down for me.What I ended up doing was converting my audiobook collection to mp3, which this thing plays flawlessly with an audiobook player app from BB.It's a pain, and Audible.com says they are looking at developing a new app for BB.We'll see.I won't say anything about the awesome keyboard.It's the big selling point for most BB phones.With the Passport, unlike with other BB phones, you cannot access the battery.This is a bit of a con for me.I liked that feature.It was nice to know I had a fully charged battery in reserve in case I needed it.Having said that, the battery in this thing seems to last forEVER!I am amazed at how long I can stream music and books and yet yammer on the phone and still have a charge left!It's incredible and real testimony to the skill of the BB product developers.I also love that I can increase the storage of this phone from its onboard 32 gb to 128 gb by using a small SD card.Awesome, and something all phones should be capable of.My wife's brand new iPhone 6 (or 7 or 8, whatever, it's the long one) came with a massive 16 gb.What a joke.Anyway, she mocked my Passport until her iPhone Number Whatever filled up with pictures and a few songs.Life's rough when you make the wrong choice.A brief word about the Amazon App store.BB phones now come with it.In theory, you are able to use certain Android apps on your BB devices.In theory that's awesome.In practice, not so much.I have an Android tablet (Nexus 7 and HP Slate 17) which are both pretty decent.However, Android apps are, for some reason, just plain wonky even on those Android device.Not all of them, but apparently the ones I like.Yes, the Audible.com app will NOT work on my Passport, even though in theory it should.Just locks the phone up.Same thing with a couple of streaming music apps.Maybe the Android game apps will work fine, who knows?The Kindle app works fine.So after all this complaining, why give the BB Passport 4 stars?Simple:This is an always reliable piece of electronics.It never freezes up or fails to work.But most of all, BB's clear call technology is wonderful.The Passport clears up every call when it comes in and my middle aged ears, damaged from too much loud AC/DC music back in the day, are able to hear word!The iPhone never did that.Incoming calls never sounded so good.That in itself is worth a star, easy.In the end, the Passport is a solid, near-flawless phone for grown ups.",2015年9月25日 在美国审核

Its system is not as good as iOS or Android,"Let's be honest. Its system is not as good as iOS or Android. Besides the inferiority in apps, its own native function still a block behind iOS at least.

The best in Email &amp; web browsing,"Email and browsing. These are the two things I need most out of my smart phone. The passport does both of these things better than any other phone I've owned or played with. I am coming back to a Blackberry from an Android, Galaxy Nexus. I loved that phone when I got it, but quickly grew tired of the inefficient email capabilities of the Galaxy Nexus. The apps on android were great, but after a while I realize I only need 1/2 a dozen apps to be happy.The passport is like carrying a mini laptop around. It allows me to easily surf on the net with the fast web browser and wide screen it's as good as using your tablet &amp;I frequently find myself using it instead of my laptop. Webpages can be viewed in full desktop mode. Other than that I use Google maps, stitcher radio, Whatsapp, BBM, facebook. It works great as a phone and everything else Bluetooth, wifi, gps works as it should (which is more than I can say for my Galaxy Nexus with unreliable bluetooth and ever poor battery life). The battery on the Passport is amazing!My wife has an iPhone 6 and I think it's a very nice device, great for games, pics and entertainment, but I know I would never be happy with it's limited email capabilities and restrictive eco system.I got this device on a hunch when it first came out. Initially I got many inquisitive and funny looks from friends asking why a Blackberry, why a BIG Square phone... but after using it for 2 months, I realize I absolutely made the right choice.

First attempt with this form factor! (Nailed It),"This is the only review I have ever written. I think something should just work! So writhing a review about a product to let people know it does never crossed my mind, or to be honest put the effort into it. The BlackBerry Passport is the perfect phone for me, It does the important things extremely well. Messaging, a real clear calling experience how trivial that sounds but so important. I always have a strong signal in areas my friends or co-workerss are struggling to get one bar. Email, web browsing and reading ebooks have never been better, my tablet just sits there. For me these are the important functions of a good smartphone. I have all the important social apps except maybe Snapchat ( I don't understand that app anyways lol). The BlackBerry Passport does the important things well and all the other stuff just fine, and this is the opposite of the other operating systems. I just don't see the benefit of having a thousand adds shoved down my throat just to get a free app. My privacy is important and there is just no better choice then a BlackBerry to protect the things that are important to me and my business Great phone for work and fun.

Liked BB 10 but couldn't get used to the phone's ...,"Had this phone for a week and I returned it to Amazon. Liked BB 10 but couldn't get used to the phone's size. It's big and you will not be able to use it with one hand. I am excited to get my hands on the Classic though as I really thing BB has the best portable email software on the market.------------Update:12/5/14:After returning my first Passport, I really started to actually miss the thing. After a few days back on the iphone, I wanted my Passport back, so I reordered! It helped too that the price had dropped to $499. This smartphone is a beast. It definitely isn't for a casual user, but if you primarily use you phone for business and you are a user that receives 50+ emails a day then this phone is for you! The camera is lacking a bit and leaves something to be desired (little slugish, slightly off) but all and all this thing motors.I haven't had more comments on a phone since I got a Motorola Star Tac....buy it, try it for a two weeks, and I guarantee you'll like it and want to keep it.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核
Amazing Device,I have had a chance to use this phone for a couple of months now and Ilove it. The browsing experience is absolutely the best. It is a little larger than the average phone but it still fits in either front or back pocket. I have read some tech reviews out there that complain about not being able to use the phone with one hand. Who does that anymore anyway? The only time I ever used a phone one handed is when I was driving and last time I checked that was illegal now. The battery life is phenomenal. After fairly heavy mixed use at the end of the day I usually have 40% to 50% battery life left. If you are a heavy browser there is a chance you could run the battery dead. I spent about 4 to 5 hours one day steady browsing and I almost didn't make the day without having to plug it in. I also found that using the GPS app (which by the way is awesome) the battery experiences some heavy drain but dimming the screen definitely helps. This isn't really a negative because it is still far better than any iphone or android phone that I've used in the past. If you are a game player this phone may not appeal to you. I am a businessman not a game player so it works very well for me. I also used to carry a tablet with me for when I reviewed documents or when I did some heavier browsing which I don't do anymore. Browsing with this device is amazing.I still find some of the Tech reviews out there amusing. There seems to be some negative feedback from some of them however the user reviews no matter where you look are outstanding and who are you going to believe anyway. I decided to try the Passport based on the customer reviews that I had read in the past and I absolutely don't regret it.One more thing that I forgot to mention is that I had dropped my passport onto a ceramic tile concrete floor one time. I'm guessing it fell about 4 ft. I couldn't find out what part of the phone it landed on because there was absolutely no damage to the phone. I had read in drop test reviews before that the Passport was very durable but I forgot to mention my experience until I read another review where they had a similar experience.,2014年12月18日 在美国审核
Passport Vs HTCOne M8 vs Iphone 6,"I am a verified buyer (http://www.amazon.in/review/RJKB83RNSKFOO/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00NTYJQM2&amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;nodeID=976419031&amp;store=electronics) I have all three phones concurrently and would like give an review based on my experience with all three devices but focusing on the Passport primarily. When they tell you that the Passport is a productivity machine I have to agree with the categorization. The Hub is awesome I have all my mail accounts including WhatsApp, Linked, Facebook, Instagram (Igrann Pro) ,google chat, etc. I hear people say is that not an information overload on the Hub? The answer is actually NO this is because you can choose to see what is always displayed and accounts that are displayed when you select them.Mail -- is butter smooth I cannot say how much better it is than the Gmail app on the HTC M8 or the Mail app on the iPhone 6. The issue I have with Gmail on the HTC(android in general) is that if you have non Gmail accounts you have to rely on the Mail app which is pretty poor and laggy. Mail on IOS 8.xx is an improvement but you still get ""the message cannot download at this time"" but it does have some nifty features like recognising tracking numbers and dates for appointments etc. The testament of how good the Hub is that even when I in from of my computer I look to reply to emails using my Passport (also the keyboard has a part to play here). The email on the BB is clear and I actually am able to read some reports that I get instead of skimming them as I do both on the M8 and the iPhone 6,This for me is priceless. The passport is a couple of evolutions ahead of the competitionOther Messaging - Here again while the fact that whatsapp on iPhone and Android are able to compress large videos before sending across the BB 10.3 Whatsapp cannot/does not. This might be a showstopper for some for others. Here I would give the competition the advantage though caveat it that you don't have a single point of integration as the Hub (Snowball for Android is trying to do the same) and No notifications do not count in the integrated hubTyping - I am pretty fast on the virtual keyboards yet I must say typing on the Passport is pure joy. For all you road warriors its like typing on an IBM Thinkpad after one of those ultraportable laptops you appreciate the key travel and the tactile feel of the keysApp notifications - Here both the M8 and the iPhone 6 are far ahead and I am not sure whether BB10.xx will catch up anytime soonApps - This the 800 pound gorilla in the room. Spoiler alert IOS8 wins hands down. The passports implementation of Android 4.4.3 is not ready for the big time yet. I have had some lag performance and crashes and random errors including QNXLauncher is not something or the other do you want to shut it down. I will give a list of apps that I use that work on the device, but all in all it is a step in the right direction but a long way to go still.So the progression from IOS to BB 10.3 is a follows 80% of apps I use on IOS are there on Android 70% of those that are on Android work on bb 10.3 so from IOS to BB 10.3 your app universe shrinks by 40-45%. Is it bad? not really . Is it ideal? Not really.Apps that I Use and work are as follows (not Exhaustive but what I use)a)Salesforce Classic (better than the native connect to salesforce)b) Engadgetc)Flipboard(a bit troublesome sometimes but generally works)d) Soundhound (again better than native)e) Spotify ( yes works great)f)Guardian,Wsj (again a hit or miss and crashes or freezes often)g) Swarm (Not foursquare),Zomatoh) Pininteresti)Rokuj)Goal.comk)Todoistl)Moneycontrol,Bloomberg,FT,ET,TOI(again better than Native)m) Connect for Garmin (syncs my Vivofit), Whitings ,Training Peaksn) Luminosity(some scaling issues) ,DuolingoApps that I have not been able to get to worka) Onenoteb)Viberc) Zygna Poker, Asphalt 7d) Bubble DsBB Assistant - This is slow but I will say awesome even better that Siri (but slower ) One example will highlight this ""I fee like eating a Kebab"" the assistant will take some time but come back with a list of food places with kebab in them where as Siri says ""Sorry I can't look for Restaurants in India"" cummon!!Maps - not as straight forward as Google but not bad and I have side loaded google maps (no google play support so it won't remember your searches) otherwise works quite well, but Nokia Here maps did not work when side loadedBattery - I am not so sure yet on this as I do need to currently charge it every day and that could be because I am trying a lot on it everyday. So I will reserve comment on it other than it is better than an M8Screen - here I feel the M8 might be the best but I love the form factor and clarity and brightness of the screen even at 50% brightness4g or LTE - this is another reason my review gave it a notch down as I am not happy that the Passport does not support the 2300MHz band in India. Also I have forced 3G selection but it is ( for the new antenna tech and jargon) as good as either my M8 or iPhone 6 maybe a software update will sort this outLooks - honestly people find the phone strange and I introduce it as the Blackberry TV and some people even believe it. I don't care.So all in all I give it a 4 Stars because it is my goto phone for work and some play but I carry an iPhone 6 around in the evenings. This is neither practical or feasible for everyone so make your own decisions but for me the passport is here to stay. While some of my views are India specific I think they generally hold.",2014年10月19日 在美国审核
Blackberry: Please forgive me for leaving you!!!,"What can I say?? I'm ashamed for leaving blackberry some years ago. The last BB I had was a BB Curve and it was awesome... and as most of you, I leave BB for the shinny newcomer in those days: The Iphone.I bought this BB directly from the Blackberry Store because they offer to add the desktop charger and a case for free. Anyway, this smartphone is so good that I feel the need to write this review so everyone can appreciate what this BB is capable of. I don't write reviews in fact this my first or second review ever on any product.I've had many flagship smartphones to this date... All the Iphones since the first one to the 5s... and after that I gave up using Iphones and all Apple products...I also had many Android smartphones... Samsung's, HTC's, Motorola's, Sony's... you name it... Don't take it the wrong way,Iphones and Androids are great smartphones with poor battery life... all with great apps... but once I started using this BB Passport I won't look back again... Please Blackberry, don't quit producing smartphones.QUALITY AND CRAFTSMANSHIPThis is the most gorgeous smartphone I've ever had... period! No Iphone, no Samsung no other phone is made to this standards. This BB has the best industrial design I've ever seen on any smartphone. It is all is made from stainless steel. It feels hefty in the hand... it feels... important. If you drop it you may damage the floor with it. In person it looks 1000 times better than in any pic. This is the most elegant smartphone available today... The Passport Silver Edition could have been the Porsche design edition easily (without the price tag)... this phone is that good. This smartphone is an attention grabber. None can believe it's a Blackberry.FORM FACTORAt the beginning when you see this phone for the first time, looks quite strange... but that's because Apple and other manufacturers have conditioned you to believe that the rectangle is the best form factor until... you try one of these. I love the way it looks and feel in the hand. Let me make a comparison... The Iphone is like Kathy Perry... is slim, is pretty, weightless.... it's superficial.... this BB is like a Monica Belluci or a Sofia Vergara... you are amazed when you see it, but it's better when you have it in your hands... it has a very wide hips it's voluptuous... it's gorgeous.It's form factor has its advantages. All emails and documents are better on a squared screen. And having the physical keyboard is a blessing. There is no screen keyboard that interfere on what you are reading (more about the keyboard below).KEYBOARDThe keys are sculpted very wisely. The feel is great, and keys are easy to push. At the beginning I quite struggle to type with it.... I was used to use the virtual keyboards... give it a couple of days and you'll be typing as fast or faster than on a virtual keyboard... I'm sure your Apple or Android keyboards are good, but are not faster... just try to go back and manually correct the auto corrected word or whole sentences... that won't happen with a BB... in the end you will be more productive. I like the fact that the keyboard will never interfere with the data displayed on the screen. Any Iphone or Android keyboard will use 1/3 or 1/2 of your screen.... and you'll end up with a very tiny screen.... that won't happen with this BB.... Don't even bother to type on any Iphone on Android in landscape mode... the only thing you'll see is your keyboard and nothing more. I almost forgot... the keyboard is a giagant trackpad... very useful to edit text.... On this keyboard you can write very long texts and you won't be missing your destop computer at all.SCREENAgain, this squared screen is a blessing for reading documents, PDF's spreadsheets and emails. No other smartphone screen is better than this BB. If you want to see a video in a smartphone the BB Passport will not be the best experience. But I can't understand who in the hell want's to see a movie in a tiny screen... even with a 6"" screen... If you travel or commute a lot, buy a tablet, or wait until you get home and watch it on a 100"" tv screen.... If you want to see an occasional Youtube video in the bathroom, the Passport is more than enough.... the pixel density is better than any smartphone to date... you won't see any pixel at all so pictures and text are very clear. Colors are rich and very natural.BATTERY LIFENo other smartphone has the stamina this BB passport has. This battery lasts me 2 days with moderate use, and 1 full day from 6 am to 1am of the next day with a heavy use. I don't need to carry any external battery, I don't have to charge it in the office or the in car, even using GPS, or watching videos.... all the day I have the Bluetooth and WIFI on. The Iphones and Androids will deplete their batteries before the days ends. With this BB you won't be a wall or desktop huger anymore.CAMERASFront camera is good for a video conference or for an occasional selfie.... if that's your thing it will serve you ok. The main camera is excellent for an occasional shot. Many people complain about the quality of this camera, and yes, there are better cameras on other smartphones this days, but you won't really notice the difference until you shot in dark environments.... but again, if you want a good camera, buy a DSLR or mirrorless.... and you will have a great camera, even better than any smartphone.APPSThis BB has its own native apps and most of them are excellent. You can install ALL Android apps you may want into this BB... it has an Amazon app store installed, or you can install more using Snap or just Google Cobalt to use ANY Android app. All they work the same as any Android device. The apps is not an argument for not having a BB. Instagram, Google Maps, any game... you can install ANY Android app.EMAILBlackberry will handle all your email in a stellar way. I has afraid that it won't give me the same service as the Gmail app of my android device... but the experience is great!!! I can start typing an email on my PC, and I will find the draft right into THE HUB ready to finish and send it (more on that later). You can flag any email and store them. You will find all your tags converted to folders. You can use a BB with confidence and it will handle your Gmail or Google Apps mail like a champ!!PRODUCTIVITYAll email, notifications, texts, calls will converge on the Blackberry Hub. An that's a good thing. In fact I have become more efficient by using this BB. Have you ever had notifications parked on your android or Iphone on the notification center for days or weeks? It won't happen on a BB. Forget about the ""read notification - open app - process - close the app"" ritual. With the BB hub you'll do everything there. It will save you a lot of time! Before using the Hub I used to have hundreds of unread or unprocessed emails.... with this BB I have reached the email nirvana: Zero unread or unprocessed emails, notification calls, etc. You also have Blackberry Blend that is a piece of software you install on your PC or Mac and you'll be able to handle your emails, messages etc from your computer... It's like a blackberry remote on your desktop. Believe me, there is no better device for productivity than this BB.The included Docs to Go apps is a productivity suite where you can read and create Office documents, there is also an Adobe PDF reader included. All those apps will handle all your documents with aplomb.PHONE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONSAs a phone, this BB is great. I noticed that with other smartphones (Apple, android) I experienced dropped calls in certain places. Not with this BB passport... I don't know exactly why, may be it's the quality of the antennas but where other phones dropped the calls this BB will not. The sound quality is great and you have also HD voice so you will experience a crystal clear call. Speaker is very loud, even better than any HTC device to date. The same story goes to WIFI and Bluetooth.... this BB has more range than any other smartphone. With other smartphones, WIFI signal was lost in some places of my home. This one gets stronger signal than other phones, it even has the same signal than Laptops. That a big plus!CONCLUSIONThis is the finest piece of hardware you will ever own. No Iphone or Android is built like the Blackberry Passport Silver Edition. It is better constructed and is more elegant. Is an attention grabber and feels and looks very important... it's also a conversation starter. If you don't want to have the same smartphone as everyone and want to have that James Bond look, this is for you... And if you are a lady... wider is better isn't it? ;) you'll love this device and none will think that you are like every girl on the room... this BB is a statement of your good taste and uniqueness.You will reach the productivity nirvana with this BB. I have become a HUB fan, and I can't look back again. I can do the same and even more than with any other smartphone in the market... but I can do it faster than before. I am confident that I boosted my productivity since I'm using this BB.This is a true business device. It will serve you flawlessly. It can also be used by the occasional user. You can watch videos, take great photos and videos and navigate the web better than with any browser available (Safari or Chrome)... You can install almost any Android app from the Amazon store or every app from the Snap store or by using the Cobalt tools.Get one while you can, avoid the first version of the Passport and grab one of this. there is a very small price difference and this is better device. I've read that many people is stockpiling Blackberry to this dates. This ones is the one to own.Blackberry if you are reading this:Please forgive me... You still make the best smartphones on the planet. Can the Passport improve? For sure. Here are my recommendations:1. For this to be a truly business device it must have a DUAL SIM. I travel a lot and having a second sim card is very useful. My lasts android devices all had dual sims.General recommendations:1. Fire your current CEO2. Invest more money in advertising. Your devices deserve it.",2016年3月18日 在美国审核
Best smartphone Ive ever used,"I've used the HTC One X, Samsung S3, Iphone 5s, 4 and BlackBerry Torch over the past four years. All great phones...But... never been as happy as I am with this phone.If you place high value on a device that is great at unifying and operating for communication requirements then give this a consideration. The benefits of using this phone requires user experience for a couple weeks. It doesn't have the sales sizzle of consumer-focused phones.I won't go into the details about why this is such a pleasure to use, you can find that from other users.The bottom line is that I can consume more data and information, I type faster and very comfortably, my phone lasts a full work day and night, and this phone is constructed to be durable.I'm amazed at how much I enjoy using this smartphone.

Best Phone I have ever purchased!,"I have to start with a disclaimer that I did not purchase my Blackberry Z30 through Amazon.“A tree that is never shaking by the wind is a dead tree!” Lamine PearlheartI start with the above quote to illustrate the point that Blackberry’s reputation has been shaking many times like many other companies, perhaps more so than the others, and that it has come out, at least from the creative part, as strong contender.I have been using this Phone since June 2016 and I feel that I can with confidence pronounce a judgment on its merits and flaws.The Passport is the best Phone I have had, and, for me at least, it was a great upgrade from the Z30, and the iPhone 5; I have not owned the iPhone 6, but I had the chance to play with it as my friends have it and I can confidently say that the passport is the clear winner.This phone meets my overall needs, this being said, and this is not Blackberry’s fault, there are some limitations to it due to the lack of support of major app developers such as WHATSUP, stopping is support for it in December 2016, and VIBER which currently does not run on the passport.I have to add that I am not happy with the fact that Blackberry is going the Android way and that in the long run this will negatively impact their sales; one of the main reasons that I bought the Passport was that I wanted to continue using the BlackBerry 10 interface.I for sure will not buy a Blackberry Phone with an Android interface for the same reasons that I not will buy an Apple Computer if is a Hackintosh.The battery of the Passport is outstanding and last a long time. The form factor was a concern for me initially by now I think is an ideal format.I am very satisfied with my Passport and it if ever breaks, in the remote future, I will probably be in looking to buy the same model even if the app selection may not be great at the time; this a productive Phone for me and I am not looking for a toy.I highly recommend the Blackberry Passport .",2016年12月4日 在美国审核
Awesome business phone,"Awesome business phone.Pros:- Large, square, ultra-bright screen that makes reading, browsing, and business emails a breeze- Awesome keyboard that you won't get in ANY other phone; only a Blackberry- Battery life beats the Energizer bunny, ran for 2 days with average use- Smart OS; the Hub is a godsend to manage the messaging hell; no hardware or home buttons to press!!!- Unmatched security- Everyone will ask you ""what's that refrigerator/freezer/dryer/car crusher/phone you're carrying?!""Cons:- Users new to BB10 OS need to get used to it (though the tutorial takes less than 10 minutes if followed)- Two app stores (BB native and Amazon) and yet a poor selection of apps- Can actually successfully run Android apps but that is tricky to set up and not provided by default- Bluetooth support for car audio (and possibly other audio devices) is buggyAs a business user I love the Passport. Keyboard, screen and battery life like no other. Add the security and fluid OS and that makes the perfect phone for me and I don't give a rat's axx about the apps that are probably 80% trash anyway.",2014年12月1日 在美国审核
"If you're not into extra small, this is the way to go!","THis may be the device that rescues Blackberry fro irrelevancy (and bankruptcy or a buyout; RIMM [the sybol for the company] stock has taken a beating the last few years. BUt, you're not reading this to makemoney, onto the palmtop! (Oops let's NOT use the word ""PALM"" here, speaking of pain....I've been very reluctant to use ""smart phones,"" my cell phone is a dumbphone from Samsung that I got for probably under $25.I just didn't need it except when I was traveling, and I don't do that very often.No, no reason to get a smart phone, when I have a Kindle for books, an HP laptop (OK, so it's not as light or as small as a MacBook), an Ipod for music, a Kindle Fire for apps and movies, a digital camera, a Tom-Tom navigator GPS while driving, and a junky but manageable cell phone for emergencies.I think I just answered my own question.This new Blackberry is a combination of all of the above in one device, and for once, you don't sacrifice ease of use to have the ""convenience"" of a multi-function device that leaves one confused and disappointed.I would rather have this slightly larger phone with a real keyboard, a wide, high quality responsive screen for video or reading text(no squinting!), real integration with email, two-way communication between, for example, your home computer and your phone (and a port for flash drives when you don't want to or have no need to send ""data"" over the phone, an internet browser that is fast and dependable, and all sort of automatic shut-down and resume features. The practical size of the real keyboard (with one virtual row) and the auto-suggestion of words makes composing easy and much more fun.Amazon.com/Kindle fans will especially enjoy using this as a reader (although nothing beats the Kindle Paperwhite for outdoor reading), and the availability of Apps should satisfy most users.Audio quality is exceptional as well (sort of like, ""it even has a built-in phone""), ostensibly one reason for buying this.IF you want a multi-function device that was engineered for everyday use (and with power that lasts a surprisingly long time), and don't require that it be extra-slim, this is the model for you. You can wean yourself from at least some of those other electronic devices you've collected over the years, or at least save them for special purpose use (e.g., take your digital camera when you're planning a day of photography; your KIndle Paperwhite if you're vacationing and want to read outdoors).It's not inexpensive, but when you consider what you get (but, please, think about whether you really need everything, and not about your gadget envy/competition with friends), you may feel it's well worth it.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核
"If you're looking for something truly innovative, seriously consider this phone.","I agree with the excellent reviews here; the Passport is a great phone. I've had mine a few months and previous phones were a Z30 (which I still have), z10, iPhone4, Torch, Tour and Pearl. I'm surrounded by iPhone and Android devices so I'm somewhat familiar with the pros and cons of those. I love the design of the Passport and like having a phone that stands out from the crowd.Here are some of my thoughts (some are quite nit-picky) on the Passport.I'm still getting used to the physical keyboard. I think the z30 has the best predictive typing experience of any phone out there; it predicts whole sentences for you. The Passport is a step back from that and only gives you a choice of three word options (like iOS). Still, it's so innovative to be able to swipe the words up from a physical keyboard and also use it as a track pad. If you're trying to type quietly without disturbing anyone, note that the keys do click; a physical keyboard is not silent. On the other hand, the killer feature for many might be the keyboard shortcuts. For example, hit T for top of a list/page or B for the bottom. That alone is so convenient.I love being able to add extra space with a MicroSD card. I've added a 128GB card to the 32GB of on board memory for a total of 160GB. Need more space? Using USB to go, you can plug a card reader into the phone and access yet another MicroSD card.The multi-color message light is great; I can tell I have a message and what type of message it is just by glancing at the phone.As others have said, Blend is fantastic. Access all your messages from your desktop or tablet. Even if you leave your phone at home, you can still access all your messages anywhere in the world as long as your phone is connected to wifi... and turned on. I was pleasantly surprised at how slick the app looks on my MacBook. I can't use Blend on my Mac at the same time I access work via VPN. I guess they use the same technique.Another thing I like with Blackberry is being able to securely access my home computer files with Link. It's very simple to share a folder in Link and have it appear on your BB10 phone wherever you are. You'll never forget a file at home again! No need to mess with tunneling through your firewall.The camera can take beautiful photos and has many new features added with each release but focus is still quite slow. One neat feature of BB10.3 is that when you take photos, the photo gallery groups them by similar date and prepares a Story Maker slide/video show of what happened that day complete with stock music. You could take photos at a party or event and just play the video at the end of the evening wirelessly.Screen is gorgeous and a joy to use. Note, though, that if you think it would be THE Instagram phone, it actually isn't.Instagram doesn't display ideally on a square screen because the extra information above and below the photo.Some apps aren't optimized for the square screen yet but most are. Paper Camera is probably the one I can't yet use on the Passport. These complaints are more consumer oriented. Business users probably couldn't care less. I'm sure this will be fixed in time.The phone is larger than many but don't let the size scare you. It's such a powerful device you'll be amazed at how small it actually is given what you can do with it.Although the Passport is very well built and rugged, it is not indestructible. I smashed the screen a few days ago when it launched out of my pocket while running. (Yes, I take it running.) Any screen will break if it falls just right (or wrong). A case is a good idea... as it is with any phone.While getting my Passport fixed I'm using a loaner from a friend. This Passport has the latest release candidate OS build and shows the cool new features just around the corner.Oh, and I'm a real user. I got my phone from my carrier. As the winner of this year's Mobile Nations Halloween Photo Contest, you can see the Passport in the photo.",2014年12月16日 在美国审核

It's great for keeping up with email when away from the office and the screen is large.I am always getting asked what kind of phone I have and where they can get it.My advice is check it for yourself.

A really classy device!,"First of all, I'm a Blackberry loyalist, have been for 8 years now, so I am biased, but this is a great device and I'll try to articulate what I think is good and bad about it.When I first saw leaks of this device, I thought this was real ugly. However, as more detailed images came about, the build quality really stood out and I decided to get this instead of the upcoming classic. I always prefer devices with excellent build quality over gimmicky plastic stuff.After a few weeks now, here are my thoughts:Pros:Size - yes, it is a pro. I love the screen real estate and that I can open article links etc and read everything just fine. Combine with the Reader mode in the BB10 browser and you get a really good way to consume content. It is a bit difficult for one handed use for apps and swiping, but for using it with one hand for the phone it is just fine. My main adjustment with this is that I am not used to keeping my phone in the pocket, I've been a holster shooter till now and this is too big to holster.Keyboard - Took about 1 week to get used to it, 2 weeks to get good at it. However, once you get used to it, it FAR surpasses the keyboard on the Q10 I used to have.Battery Life - My second device was a Lumia 1520 and this device matches the incredible battery life that I got out of the Lumia. On a heavy use day, I can go to bed with 20% left. On a normal day, I'm usually at the 50% or above mark at the end of the day.BB 10.3 OS - This device ships with the new 10.3 OS which REALLY shows me that BBRY is committed to devices because they have done a fabulous job with it. It is very fluid and email ""triage"" is way better than before.Blend - I just set this up yesterday, so it is still new to me, but is a great concept - it uses your phone as your communications server and then you can just view a desktop PC/Mac/iPad user interface to view and compose email, text messages, transfer files etc. Cool thing is that the user interface is only a user interface, no data is stored on the remote device. This allows you to use full encryption and protection on your device while using the larger form factor of a user interface to do daily communications while at your desk.Cons:Apps - Amazon appstore has a lot of Android apps, but they don't scale or perform as smoothly as native BB apps, so I have not been impressed with this. The basics are there, but if you want an iOS like experience with games and kardashians, then this is not the best device for you.Matte Back - The back of the device is a gorgeous matte finish similar to the Lumia 1520 - but it has a tendency to show oil stains from fingers a lot more prominently. I had this issue with the Lumia 1520 also, so it's not a BBRY specific problem.I do highly recommend going with the hard shell case - it adds a good amount of grip to it that makes typing even more enjoyable on this, not to mention it does not show oily finger stains. Looks very nice and premium on the Passport and will protect against drops and bumps.",2014年11月5日 在美国审核

"Unstable blackberry hub, unpredicatable battery life, slow camera and video focus speeds, weak wifi reception","Pros:-Blackberry hub is well designed, nice to see all notifications in one screen.-Nice wide screen for reading email-Notification light great for detecting incoming messages/events-Nice swipe gestures-Nice built in alarm clock (has the ascending volume alarm which is very nice)Cons:-Weak wifi signal reception, my wife had a nexus 5 and she was receiving wifi when the blackberry got nothing-Blackberry hub after 1 month of usage started to become unstable and would hang, requiring the phone to be rebooted (device is stock software, no jailbreak or hacks)-Slow camera focus speed and video focus accuracy-Heavy (the phone has a premium feel to it, but is on the heavy side)-Phone would activate in the pocket thus draining battery life, there isn't an instant lock feature (pressing the power button to turn off the screen does not disable swipe up to unlock)-Tactile buttons while nice to detect, are too hard to press, the buttons are supposed to get easier to press after usage, but I did not notice that, also lack of physical numbers makes inputting numbers inconvenient, and also the position of the virtual numbers being clustered in a side is not convenient, would have preferred a single row of numbers (that mimics a keyboard).I really wanted to like this phone, but after using this for a month and a half, I returned it. There were multiple key reasons for this, primarily, blackberry hub isn't very stable and would lock up at times, requiring a reboot of the phone. I don't know if my phone itself is defective but I don't recall reading other users having issues with this, basically it would locked up and not respond to any touch or swipes while in the hub. Other key reasons were unpredictable battery life as the phone would sometimes burn power by turning on apps by itself in my pocket, even though I had set the device to autolock in the shortest duration, and I would press the power button before putting the device in my pocket. Also, the wifi antennas of this phone when the wifi signal are noticeably weaker than a nexus 5. For most scenarios, wifi is fine, but we basically had a scenario where our wifi signal was really weak (had to travel down a corridor and through a wall, and compared to a nexus 5, the blackberry got 0 wifi signal while the nexus 5 managed a consistently stable connection). The camera focus speed is quite slow, and the video does not appear to reliably auto focus without tapping the screen (other android phones like samsung will attempt to auto detect the key subject in video and auto focus, without requiring a screen tap to focus).",2015年1月27日 在美国审核
Best in class Corporate Masterpiece,"I have seen lots of reviews on this phone &amp; it creates mix feelings. Haters gonna Hate.. I have been a Blackberry fan for a few years now since the 9780, 9900, Z10, Z30, Q10 &amp; Playbook &amp; I can say that Blackberry have always been a powerhouse for business. I also have a Galaxy Note 3 as my daily driver so don't think I don't use Android ecosystem.I don't care what people says I already pre order it &amp; will test it on my own. People talk for a matter of talking. You can't talk negative about something you have not tried.The reviews I've read so far seem to be about average. The biggest problem people are having with it is that they say it's ""too unwieldy"" and ""you can't type on it using one hand"". It sounds very familiar to when the Galaxy Note first came out. It was thought to be a niche device but is now selling almost as well as their main flagship product, the Galaxy S series. Also, who types using just one hand? I find myself getting frustrated with how slow I type using one hand that I force myself to use two to get texts and emails out.Saying it's too late for Blackberry is non sense.. No one knows how this will sell because we can't read the future.I trust John Chen ... Blackberry is back.",2014年9月25日 在美国审核
Five Stars,"Switched from an iPhone 5s, I've used all sorts of gadgets and devices from android to apple and kindle fire.This device is a workhorse. Once you get your apps from both app stores and get it set up there's no turning back.I wish BlackBerry had this innovative design years ago.I downloaded snap to make up for some of the missing items from amazon.Twittly and Ober seem to work fine, those are native clients for twitter and Uber, respectively.This device isn't too big, it's not strange, it is the size of a passport, that's not odd or weird.Browsing in landscape is phenomenal.Igrann, the instagram client is better than instagram.For your friends on imessage, there is BBM for iPhone and for android.Simply said, this is the best all around device I've used to date.I missed that flashing led, I've missed the keyboard,security,and amazing build quality.",2014年10月12日 在美国审核
This phone rocks!,"Wonderful phone! I am replacing my Z10 with an unlocked Silver Passport and when I switch back the old phone seems .... ""narrow"" I'm a terrible typist on any phone but I'm getting faster day by day with this real keyboard. And I like that the virtual keyboard changes depending on the application.I got mine directly from shop blackberry because they were offering a bundle deal at the same price as here.

The Blackberry Passport IS the best phone - hands down!,"After using all the major phones (2- Androids, 1-iPhone) and not really being totally satisfied as far as speed, accuracy (for typing/texting) and low bug count, I did some research and I kept coming back to this phone. So 5 weeks ago I decided to give it a try - and I'm really glad I did. The positive reviews you see are true! This IS the best phone on the market now. The company that design and sells these phones (Research in Motion - RIM) do the best job of ensuring that their phones are not only well designed, but do not get released with ""showstopper"" bugs (bugs that affect useability - like hangs and crashes). It's clear that they put ""a lot"" of effort into hardware and software quality assurance. They basically blow all the other companies away in this regard. RIM - keep it up you have a new convert!",2017年3月20日 在美国审核
Media Pundits have an iPhone-bias. This is one phone you definitely want to try.,"There are several reasons I chose this over iPhone 6+:1. Battery life: It blew away all other smartphones out there!!! I move around between places, and boy, do I hate carrying chargers everywhere.2. Typing and editing is the biggest pain in the neck on a iPhone or Samsung. Passport's wide screen is huge bless for text and spreadsheet work, not to mention the physical keyboard.3. This doesn't bend. Who would want a phone that bends in your jeans.4. Strong signal and amazing reception.5. Great sound system.6. The Blend feature! I can control and work on this beast via any other device. That's amazing.7. Office, Word, Spreadsheet apps. Work-related apps.BlackBerry is finally doing something right. Don't listen to the media reviewers. They just walked out from a lavish dinner with Apple people, and will naturally downplay this lovely gem from BB.I say just try it. Trust your own judgement. And if you don't like it, simply return it to Amazon for FREE! So what's the risk?",2014年9月26日 在美国审核
"EXCELLENT PHONE, and I think it is better then ...","EXCELLENT PHONE, and I think it is better then the Samsung Note, and Iphone , which I have had the opportunity to own both, with there high prices. Looks sleek, impressive, smooth operating, difference shape, and the Blackberry Hub which place everything right in your hand for navigating, and manipulating the phone.Of cause everything has a downside, which I didn't appreciate the load up when turning on the phone very slow turn on which takes a few minutes, but then again it's loading up 32 GB's mind you. Secondly, it's hell learning the phone evening with the Tutoring assistance, but after you get it down then you can start rolling. That's why I gave it four star instead of five.Over repeat, EXCELLENT PHONE.Again let me remind you, this phone will not work with Consumer Cellular Services asking for headaches, which I had to switch to AT&amp;T to make it work , will not work with T-Mobile asking for headaches, even though they run on GSM system on AT&amp;T towers, and my phone was factory unlocked.

Packed with innovation and power,"Size : To begin with the size of the device is in between traditional smartphones such as an iPhone, Galaxy S4 and the phablets likeNote3 and Iphone 6 plus. You can easily grip the phone in one hand, but this is not made for single-handed operation. After all, there is no rulebook that says a phone must. In comparison the phone looks smaller in person than in photos and fits nicely in jean photos unlike Note 3, Iphone 6 plus which pops out a bit and gets uncomfortable while sitting.Performance: The Passport is a work horse.So there is no question of the not being able to perform a task. It is also a great multi-tasking and I could work simultaneously on up to 12 apps at the same time. Interestingly, the apps on the background are not frozen and you can see even Twitter,BBM, weather updates on the minimized screen.Camera: This is a stunner of a clicker. The camera is good as is and if not better than the ones found on the Apple devices and much better than any flagship Android. It's all in the software and Apple has been perfecting their image processing since the launch of the first Iphone and Blackberry is slowly getting there. It has got better camera hardware than iphone 6 but their image processing software still needs improvements to rival Apple's software which I am sure will happen with future Blackberry release OS updates (10.3.1 scheduled next month).Audio quality: There is pure innovation on this front. Firstly, a phone should fulfill some basic requirements such as connectivity andcall quality and there is no vendor better than Blackberry who understands that. BlackBerry still has the best voice quality around and now adds multi-directional microphones that work wonders when use use the device as a speaker phone and/or in headset mode.Assist :Yes, the Passport has a Siri-like Assistant. It works quite well and gives you the option to shift to a text search on the app itself .Display : The 1440 x 1440 pixels display is excellent, sharp and is clear even under the sun. Browsing, reading, filling out forms, viewing images is such a nice experience that I am thinking of retiring my Ipad mini.Keyboard : Blackberry need not prove any thing in this space but they upped the bar really high with this new key board and done the unthinkable. Now the keyboard acts as a giant trackpad - now you can use the keyboard to scroll though long emails,scroll through web pages , move pointer precisely on text in documents and email (otherwise such a pain in a.. on touchscreens) , select text,insert next word predictions by using flicking gestures on the keyboard. And there are many more trackpad gestures you can perform on the keyboard.Software :The BB10 is absolute best OS and schools IOS and Android on how to build a productive software.vs IOSEmail - HUBCustom profilesReal Multitasking - unlike freeze and goOpen standards (Miracast, DLNA, NFC for everything and not just payments)USB OTG (you connect a USB drive as in computer)HDMIWork and Personal profilesIntuitive gesture based OSMicro SD supportNot wall-gardened and yet more secureVs Android.Email - HUBSecurityStabilitygranularity of permissions onthird party AppsNo lag whatssoeverWork and Personal profilesIntuitive gesture based OSNo crippled third party skins which drag down the performance and efficiency.Absolute best call quality and network connectivity.If you use a BB10 device for a week or two and then you can't get over HUB functionality and begin to wonder how come you missed such a wonderful thing on other OSes.Apps and Ecosystem :With 10.3 update it has best Android capability ever on BB10 and an inclusion of Amazon App store that has 90% of the top rated apps. For the 10% that are not available like Instagram use snap available app in Blackberry app store to download from Google Play.Verdict : Is this a device for everyone? - may be no. is it an aspirational and a productive device? - yes, no doubt about it and yes it is the best Blackberry so far and most innovative phone of the year. iphone is so 2007 and Android is still a messy affair and that said Blackberry brings in some fresh airpacked with lot of innovations which any user will begin to appreciate it.",2014年10月6日 在美国审核
Perspective from the average consumer.,"I'm going to be reviewing from an average consumer point of view, rather than from a business consumer point of view, but hopefully this will still provide a lot of people with some insight.First some background on me and why I got this phone:I've been a die-hard Blackberry fan for years, ever since the Blackberry Pearl 8100 was released (the first Blackberry with a camera for those who remember).Blackberry has always impressed me with their keyboards, even when keyboards were still pretty standard on phones.Blackberry has alwayshad a unique way of implementing this feature, and this goes for the Passport even today.That said, with the exception of the amazing notification and email system all the way up to OS 7, Blackberry's OS was starting to get really really really stale, so I had moved on to iOS for the past 10 months now.The iPhone's email features were actually pretty darn decent, and the notification system was lacking, but still acceptable. That said, I really missed the high quality of Blackberry's phones, and while Apple doesn't usually skimp on the quality either (with the exception of the 6+ bendgate issue), I really missed that high quality keyboard.My last BB before switching- what I assumed would be permanently -away from BB was the Bold 9900 and while the keyboard was amazing, as a lot of people have already said, the rest of the phone was pretty much terrible.It was sadly time to move on.So I got the iPhone 5s and was pretty blown away by the quality of that phone.Still I always missed blackberry and was just waiting for the day when the company would release something better that would blow away the iPhone (admittedly not hard to do).The industry finally changed to the point where having a huge phone was acceptable, so the BB could have a huge screen and still sport a keyboard without it seeming like an outlier.Now that phablets are a thing,BB could finally take the steps it need to get back in the game.Here are all the things I love/take issue with from an average consumer point of view:1) The screen.Yes, I'm sure you've heard in the media and many reviews that this phone probably won't attract the average consumer that is used to all of the huge phablets and movie-worthy screens.I honestly don't feel like I've lost anything in switching from a 16:9 ratio to a 1:1 ratio.If I wanted to watch a movie on a high quality screen I would turn on my Macbook or flatscreen TV.So I don't understand why this is such a huge draw for people.If this is the major thing drawing you to a phone, then that doesn't seem like that great of a phone to me.For me, I only watch stuff on my phone when I don't have access to a computer anyway, and of course I'm always going to expect the quality to be lower.However, despite the squarish screen of the Passport not being the ideal screen to watch movies on, I do just fine with Netflix and Youtube.It's still a MAJOR improvement over the Bold 9900, which didn't even have a square screen.I don't really feel like I'm missing out on anything as an average consumer who apparently ""only cares about apps and videos.""In fact, what I do most is actually just browsing the web and reading on my phone, and this screen is pretty ideal for that, so I have absolutely no complaints.Actually, out of every single phone I've ever tried, Blackberries have always had the best screens in comparison to their competition when it comes to vibrancy of color, crispness and readability in sunlight.You can give me the best screen resolution with any iPhone or Android phone and I will still prefer the Blackberry for the simple fact that I can actually see it in sunlight!iPhone has done better in terms of that in recent years, but every company has always lagged behind Blackberry when it comes to that one thing.Even with the backlight turned all the way down on every single Blackberry I've ever owned (even the Pearl), I can still see the screen clear as day in any setting.The Passport definitely lives up to this expectation, but on top of that, it also has the best screen resolution of any phone I've used, the colors are wonderful and it's just an amazing experience overall when it comes to navigating through the OS.Is square better? For some things, in fact, most things.The only thing it's not good for is videos, which ultimately is a very small part of the phone experience, for me anyway.2) Camera:I haven't taken many pictures with this phone, but it does everything I need it to do, including macro and auto-focus, which the 9900 was terrible at.I tried the Q10 out for a few weeks, and while it was greatly improved, it still wasn't living up to the iPhone 5s that I was simultaneously using.After getting rid of both of those phones so I could buy the Passport, I'm glad I made the decision because the camera is vastly improved over every Blackberry camera I've ever used.I haven't tried the front-facing camera yet (I never used it on the iPhone 5s either), so I won't comment on that, but the rear camera will get you by wonderfully, and you do not have to take square photos for it.There are panorama and landscape settings, just like any other phone.For me, photo quality is a very important aspect of any phone purchase, and I'm impressed.True, the 9900 had probably the worst camera of any blackberry I've ever used, but I was willing to sacrifice that for the keyboard.In the case of the Passport you are sacrificing nothing.You get great media features and great productivity features, which is rare for any phone on the market.3)Apps.Are there enough apps?Yes, there are plenty.Not only does Amazon app store come preloaded and let you download most android apps, which have all functioned smoothly for me, the phone can also sideload Snap, which is another form of the android app store, where you can get any apps that Amazon and BB World may be lacking, which isn't many.Here is a list of some apps I've downloaded in BB World and Amazon: iHeartradio, Shazam, Kindle, Netflix, Tweetcaster, Trillian, Skype, Yelp, AVG, Opera, Dolphin Browser, eBay, Roku, Vine, etc.I am not a huge app consumer, but after my experience with the Apple store and the atrocious Bold 9900, I can honestly say there is not a single app that I feel like I am missing from iOS.The app selection has vastly improved between BBOS7 and the BB10 release.I have only had to download a few apps through Snap and have found that most work just fine without any sort of tweeking, but even the ones that don't fully function can be altered if you visit crackberry.com and look at their tutorials.So the lack of apps complaint is 100% moot at this point.I'm not a gamer or huge media consumer or anything like that, so I can't comment on those things so much.Perhaps the Passport is lacking apps in those areas, but for the stuff I usually use, I didn't find myself wanting at all, and for anything that was missing, I've always found a worthy alternative.I even managed to use Snap to download my credit union's app, which I totally wasn't expecting to be compatible, but it works 100%!4) Phone's form factor:For someone like me (5'0"" with tiny hamster hands), this phone is monstrous, but when compared to other phablets, there really isn't much of a difference.It's just differently shaped.This is definitely a two-handed device for someone like me, but that's okay because I've always functioned two-handed with any phone (except the Pearl).The 9900 seems like a tiny phone next to this thing, and I still used that two-handed.So was I surprised or dismayed at the requirement for two-handed use with this device?Nope.I'm used to it anyway.The iPhone 5s is billed as a ""one-handed"" device, and I still never felt comfortable using it one-handed because my hands are so darn small lolI could do some things one-handed on the iPhone 5s that I can't do on the Passport, but it's not a huge annoyance.It's just something to get used to. You definitely can't text one-handed with this device, so you won't be able to drive while texting, which is probably for the best, as others have mentioned.Actually, I really feel like I've cut down on my texting while driving, which makes me feel really good.Now when I need to text I usually pull over to stop somewhere.On the other hand, when it comes to holding the phone for other things, such as reading and scrolling, it is a very heavy phone, at least compared to a lot of other light-weights out there.It's definitely heavier than any other BB I've had.It can get a bit crampy in my hands when trying to read in bed holding it above my head.It's just one of those phones you have to set down on something to use or be sitting up holding two-handed.That might really irritate some people.Personally, I think it's something worth getting used to.5)The keyboard is unlike any other phone out there.It will take some major adjusting to get used to it.Part of it is the fact that there is no physical alt button to select numbers or punctuation.You have to use the onscreen keyboard for those things.The keyboard is three rows of letters and every other character you want to use you will have to go on-screen.Fortunately, the screen is so huge that it doesn't disrupt one's ability to view what is being typed, as can be the casewith other phones that when turned sideways tend to lose a lot of screen space.Some people had complaints about the spacebar being in the middle of the third row of letters, but because I prepared myself mentally for that fact, it has never become an annoyance.I have only hit the space bar a couple of times by accident when trying to select other letters.Others complained that it was a constant thing for at least a couple of weeks, but I had no problem adjusting to this layout right away.Autocorrect is also really helpful in this phone.6) Notification system:As with the other OS10 devices, the notification system is really lacking in the Passport.This is one of my only complaints, and I suspect most people might not care.Most likely there is an app I can download for better customization anyway.I just really hate the fact that you can't individually customize email and message ringtones, LED, vibration, etc anymore like in OS7.What I really liked about OS7 was the fact that you could customize how many times a notification ringtone goes off, the length of vibration, the amount of vibration, holster settings etc.It was one of the major things that kept me faithful to Blackberry for so long, the customizability of notifications.Sadly, in OS10.3 we still don't see any improvement on that front, which makes me pretty sad.The one thing that Blackberry has gong for it in the notification system customization area is that all the other OS's available also lack that same customizability.But when compared to older BB devices, you definitely miss that feature.However, the notification banners are something I really love, and I'm glad Blackberry added that feature to OS10.7)This is a small point, but there are some features of the Hub that bother me.While organization of the Hub is flexible and awesome, there was one thing I really liked about older BB devices: you could see all your sent emails as well as all your received emails, in one place.Now, in OS10, you can't see your sent messages without going into the settings and turning them on, which can be hard to find, but also the sync causes problems in this area.I like to have ALL of my email messages synced when I set up an account, so I choose the ""forever"" option when syncing.As a result, when an email account has all its messages synced, and when I try to have the sent folder synced as well... it syncs every single sent message.... I've sent thousands of emails so to have that clogging up my hub is a major annoyance.On older OS's you could see your sent messages without it syncing every single one of them.There is no way to have different sync options on individual folders.You either sync every folder in one account the same way, or you don't sync it at all.So let's say I wanted to keep sent emails in my hub from a week back, but I also wanted all my other folders synced from ""forever"", I can't just have a week's worth of sent emails, but have access to all of my emails from every other folder.It's an all or nothing scenario, so if I want all my other folders synced ""forever"", I have to sync my sent folder that way too.It's really sucky, and has resulted in me turning my sent folders off for sync because I can't stand all those thousands of sent messages showing up *sigh*.If there is any way around this, please let me know!Additionally, I hate how you can't see all the inboxes in one place.You can set up the hub to show all your email addresses in one place, but you can't pick the specific folders in the hub.The Hub will basically show every single folder you have synced, even if all you want to do is see all your inboxes in one place.iOS does this pretty well.Perhaps there is an app I can download that does email better.In the end, I suspect this might not be something most people care about, otherwise Blackberry would have implemented some kind of customization feature regarding this.Overall, the very few flaws that I do find with the OS can ultimately be ignored because the rest of the phone is so amazing.This might not be marketed toward the average consumer, but Blackberry never was anyway, and I still always loved them.The Pearl was my very first smartphone, and every time I've tried to switch to another OS, I've always found it to be lacking compared to BB, despite the awesome specs of Apple or Google phones.OS10 is no exception to this rule.I love it more than iOS7, despite some flaws in the hub and the notification system.Blackberry has definitely improved in terms of OS and I think they can safely be labeled best OS on the market (I'm sure some Apple and Android fanboys would contest this).I try to view these things objectively, not from a fangirl stand-point.There are some things about iOS that are objectively better, some things about Android that may be objectively better, but what BBOS10 does best is that it implements those same features in a unique way that is easy and intuitive enough for the average consumer, but also innovative enough to keep Blackberry competitive.Trust me, if something better does come out, I will gladly switch, despite being a huge fan of BB, but for now the Passport is the best phone available in my opinion.If you're being objective you will agree.Yes, I'm pretty loyal to blackberry, but I have been able to change my mind when something better was available.In this case, I changed my mind back to BB when something better than an iPhone came out, and I don't regret it :)EDIT:I also forgot to mention some really obvious stuff.The battery is amazing and will last me days at a time.The speakers blow away any other device I've ever had.They are really awesome for any type of media experience you want to have.Music sounds superb on this baby.Okay, I'll add anything else as it comes to mind :)",2014年12月3日 在美国审核

My Passport back to being productive on the road,"I tried iPhone5 then iPhone6 (thinking I needed a larger screen), but nothing seemed to work in terms of being able to do e-mail and look at documents when I was out of the office.Then I got the Passport - wow! Is all I can say. Trying to type anything with mixed case characters, numbers, symbols etc... on the iPhone was simply torture.The Passport with its ""smart"" keyboard makes this surprisingly easy.The automatic word suggestion seems to read my mind when I am composing e-mails. Also, I find the screen size very intuitive, at first it looks a little boxy, but then you realize it has the perfect aspect ratio to review a document. But it still fits comfortably in my shirt pocket, or in the pocket of my suit jacket - no bigger than a passport as the name implies.I do not think it could perform any better. I have not found an application that I could not find an app for. Really impressed. I am now getting high marks for getting these devices for my upper management. I am waiting for the downside, but I have not found it yet. - Ron",2015年8月8日 在美国审核

I owned every bold until I dropped the Q10 in favor of a Samsung Galaxy S4. Boy I hated how cheap that phone was. Then I found myself upgrading to HTC one M7. This was a great phone and is still is except that the battery barely hold for a full day and the virtual keyboard leaves a lot to be desired.Now on to the BB passport. I have been waiting for this thing to be launched in Qatar since its official announcement and finally my wait was over. I picked one up a week ago and I'm so glad I did. The size is a little awkward at first but that what makes this phone special. The screen is top notch, the keyboard is simply amazing, the phone is nicely built with a cool steel wrap around.

Excellent phone but big.,"First of all permit me to say that I have used this phone for about 3 weeks. The contract was for me NOT to write about it prior to its official release. First things first: I am NOT a BB fan and nor I am an Android fan or an Apple fan. I have owned BBs, only because they came with the corporate I worked at and also owned 2 Android phones as personal phones.Ask yourself a simple question: What do you do, usually with a smart-phone? I travel daily 90 minutes each way to office using public transport and my observation is most individuals listen to music along with initially checking their emails, weather, news. In addition, some download videos in advance and watch them. Finally a bunch play solitaire or candy crush or some simple games. If this is a generalization of yourself then this phone is absolutely perfect. All of the above is possible (especially since it allows SD cards) with a HUGE advantage, especially over Android (any versions): battery life. It blew me away, simply blew me away with the amount of surfing, testing I did but battery life with full LTE connection, bluetooth - on, GPS - on, was at least 10 times better than ANY Android phone I have seen.Next, as I see it - one big thing to factor in is specialized software released by various companies. For example - banking portal, transit information or online purchases of tickets, medical data,etc., etc. I have mixed feelings about it. The fact it allows Android applications coupled with Amazon Marketplace does eliminate to a great extent this issue however not always ; only because Amazon is lacking. So, my suggestion is to check what you really need AND USE and verify if available. I found, in my case except 1 application everything else was available.The ONLY -ve factor I said about the phone, really is the size. It's BIG, no matter how you portray it, period. Some may say, you need time to get used to it but I have small hands and really you need two hands to be truly productive.Build - superior in all aspects, compared even to venerable Apple iPhones.Phone is a phone, period. So 1 thing I always look for is how good is the connectivity. Here, I have to say this model outshines everyone, except maybe Nokia (at par). I have 1 area while traveling which is known to have extremely sporadic connections and I have observed many, many re-dialing, re-connecting. But in my 3 weeks of usage of this phone, not once has it dropped the connection, even Pandora. I suspect this has something to do with patents owned by BB / Nokia....Display, navigation: At par with Apple.Finally, I went for Apple 6, not because I disliked this phone but because it was really too big for me.",2014年9月25日 在美国审核
Awesome device,"Previous smartphone: Lumia 920Reasons for the change: Actually I was very happy with my Lumia 920 and Windows Phone in general. However, I was not comfortable typing on a touch screen. In addition the call quality was not so good and I had an empty battery in the afternoon even with quite light usage. I therefore bought a tablet (Lumia 2520) to work while traveling, but the tablet did not fit into my pockets and it bothered me that due to the quite large screen anyone could read along.Why the BlackBerry Passport? The main reason was of course the keyboard and the long battery life (I bought it via Amazon.de)Build quailty: absolutely great. Nothing creaks, there are no visible columns and all push buttons have a pleasant pressure point.Keyboard: The mere fact that I could use a physical keyboard again was great. The keys have a very pleasant pressure point and I was able to type almost as fast as on the Lumia 920 (Tipp: to train typing use the app ExtremeTypist). The fourth column with the virtual characters could be easily integrated into the flow of typing. The word suggestions are very helpful and the operating system quickly learns the user-specific words. For meaningful typing two hands are definitely needed, but that was also the case with the Lumia 920 to be honest. However if you just want to surf on the way to work you can do that easily with one hand, especially since you can use the integrated touchpad to scroll without touching the screen.Transport: shirt pocket no, jacket inside pocket yes and jeans pocket also a yes.Battery: with a constant use from 6:00 am (push synchronization of two e-mail accounts, Whatsapp and BBM, watching an hour of video on Youtube and internet use throughout the day in a low coverage area) the battery at 8:00 pm had still 34% left. With such a usage my Lumia 920 would have shut down already at around 4:00 pm. What really impressed me was the low battery consumption while using the BlackBerry Passport as a media player via bluetooth: even after four hours of music playing the battery was still at 80% (starting wih 90%). The BlackBerry Passport connected both to an Audi and a Ford without any problems.Screen: the high resolution and the bright colors are well known specifications and I was not dissapointed. But what really surprised me was how pleasant the wide screen is for reading documents and web pages without having to scroll much. Of course the Lumia 920 had the landscape mode, but while you have to scroll less sideways you have to scroll even more vertically.Apps: I was never a big app user therefore the amount of apps available was not such a relevant criteria for me. However, the offer via the Amazon store is quite large. Also, I have downloaded and installed the app Snap (which was quite easy even for a non IT guy like me) and thereby I have access to almost all Android apps. The Android apps I have downloaded are all working properly. SafeGuard for checking apps from non BlackBerry World sources for known malware is also a nice feature.Reception and call quality: here I could perform a direct test because with the Lumia 920 I had very poor reception in my workplace. After using the BlackBerry Passport for a call for the first time the person on the other end of the line asked me if I was outside since the call quality was so good. So nothing to add regarding call quality.BlackBerry assistant: quite useful as far as calendar and e-mail function is concerned, but in other areas there is still some catch up to do to get on a even level with the competition (remeber I am talking about the assisstant in German so the user experience could be much better in Englisch).Photo and Video: I am completely satisfied with the quality, only the autofocus is sometimesa bit slow. The story maker app and the possibility to zoom in and out of a running video should also be mentioned on the plus side.Operating System: I will not go into the details of the operating system, but instead make a gross comparison with Windows Phone. The first ""shock"" was of course great, since I was used to the cool Metro Design home screen of my Lumia 920. To be honest I still miss the home screen from time to time where you can put the most relevant apps, but BlackBerry ""compensates"" that by giving me the possibility to arrange my apps in folders. Another great feature is the BlackBerry hub where I can see all important messages and mails at a glance (for all so-called journalists who complain about the huge number of messages being shown in the hub in their tests: you can specify which messages should appear in the hub and which not). The performance of BES10 is very fluid and so far I had no sudden shut downs or freezes. The browser in my opinion is better and faster than the browser of Windows Phone. All in all I really got accostumed to BES10 quickly and while there are some features that I miss from Windows Phone I will not go back. The two things that really annoy me are that you can not turn of the shutter sound of the camera and the sound while dialing a number - I mean WTF how hard can it be to implement that option?Final thoughts: I have written the entire review on the BlackBerry Passport and the experience was almost as good as writing it on a Laptop. I have used the BlackBerry Passport for over a month now and it became my main working device on the go and at home. While there is room for improvement on the software side I have to say that the BlackBerry Passport is a f*****ing awesome device.",2014年11月18日 在美国审核
an excellent phone,"After using an iphone for about six years I was tired of using the virtual keyboard and the iphone's very cumbersome text select and editing features. Having a physical keyboard is far superior to the iphone's on screen keyboard. I make far fewer typos. The ability to use the keyboard as a trackpad when editing text is extremely convenient and saves a lot of time (and frustration).The screen size and resolution are also excellent. Reading text is much more enjoyable on this phone than it was on my iPhone.The operating system is also very well laid out. I find it easy to use and very intuitive.I think the size is also good. I was concerned that the phone might not fit in my pockets but this has not been a problem. I think a phone the size of some of the large phablets on the market might not fit so well.Build quality is excellent. Everything seems extremely well put together.Battery life is excellent.All the apps I need are available but I don't use a ton of apps. I don't care about the latest 'cool' apps. If lots of apps are important to you, this might not be the best phone for you.Overall, I'm very happy with this phone.",2015年1月2日 在美国审核
Probably the best Blackberry of ever,"Probably the best Blackberry of ever. Just got as a present and I must say that I'm really astonished by its beauty. The grip is much better than the previous edition and the rounded angles really make the phone looks much better. The audio is really good probably the best that I have ever heard on a mobile phone. Of course it is not a phone for everyone thanks to its dimensions but I must admit without hesitations that is the best mobile phone I've ever had in my life. The camera is very good I tried some shots and some small video and I really like the quality that comes out.The keyboard one of the most useful feature of the passport is really improved, I don't know how to explain but it seems to me faster and more accurate and the feedback better. So what else can I say? I sold my old passport and got this one and I can tell that I'm really really satisfied with it. Does it worth the purchase from the previous edition, my point of view surprisingly yes.",2015年8月7日 在美国审核
"Nearly perfect phone, but...","As a long-time user of Windows Phone, I am not afraid to try a phone that isn't Android or iOS. After reading many reviews, and having my Lumia 920 on the fritz, I decided to give the BlackBerry Passport a try. I am glad I did!Some quick history: my phone use is almost entirely centered around text. Email, SMS, Facebook, Twitter, if I am using my phone I am almost always trying to get some words out of my head and onto a screen. The Passport's generous physical keyboard was a strong draw for me as a result. I fondly miss the old BlackBerrys, as well as the Motorola Droid 1, Motorla Devour, and my old LG ENV phones.The BlackBerry and the version 10 of the OS is well designed for someone like me. The ""Hub"" aggregates all notifications in a manner that action can be immediately taken on them... responding to SMS and email messages, viewing Facebook posts, etc. This was a great experience.The keyboard really met expectations as well. I could produce messages that looked good and were not mangled by auto correct or soft keyboard issues. Mission accomplished.Where the Passport missed the mark for me was in two key areas:1. Navigation - The navigation is entirely gesture based. Not only are the gestures so arcane that you can't figure anything out on your own (good luck handing the phone to your spouse so they can look something up...), but the gestures were not 100% perfect. Too difficult to master. After a week with the phone I still couldn't get to where I wanted to go without multiple tries. The other problem is that some of the apps override the system gestures, so something like ""pull down from the top"" seems to do different things in different apps. A few more hard or soft keys like Windows Phone or Android have for menu, back, home (Hub) would have done wonders.2. Size - A lot has been made about the shape of the phone. Frankly, I didn't have an opinion on the shape. But the SIZE bothered me. When I use a phone it is almost always one-handed. Between needing to quickly respond to issues during meetings, three kids at home, and any number of other situations, this phone just did not work for me.Overall, if you are someone who doesn't mind a larger size, I'd quickly recommend the Passport. For *me* I lost my patience for it when I couldn't use it during a 45 minute wait in the line at the DMV because I had paperwork in one hand. That was frustrating for me and I returned the phone later that day (replaced with an iPhone 5s which I truly dislike). But outside of that issue, the Passport is a fine phone that deserves consideration.J.Ja",2014年12月21日 在美国审核
Beware of Blakberry - fails at basics.,"I bought a Blackberry Passport Silver Edition phone, and can say that I will never recommend it (or any blackberry to anyone).Issues with the Blackberry- The Camera lost its ability to focus (hardware issue, not software issue)- Browser will reset and lose all tabs- Browser is incredibly slow to load pages and freezes many times, timing out (incredibly frustrating)- Phone will shutdown and restart on its own- Phone will lose cellular connection- Keyboard backlighting will go out, requiring restart to get it to function- When using the calendar, and moving an old event up from the past, the calendar will reset and put you back at the current date, not where the old date is. This is frustrating when you are going back through the calendar to find missed events, etc. It requires you to scroll back to the dates you are working in.- Some websites do not function well or load correctly. I cannot adequately express to you in words how annoying this can be- Battery drain - I have missed morning alarms because of this issue.- When watching videos, it defaults to a full screen. But you cannot even exit the full screen mode once the video is playing so you have to watch whatever video in its entirety or exit the browser. Very frustrating.I have tried to list out the seemingly endless list of problems with my blackberry. When you cannot even depend on the basics like camera focus, keyboard lighting, or battery performance (including missing morning alarms), web browsing, or app functionality...it is time to consider whether any blackberry can be worth your time. The plethora of non-software issues should be cause for concern for anyone considering a blackberry. In addition, when I received my new blackberry, it had an issue with its SIM card rear cover, and I asked for a replacement. I believe they sent out a refurbished unit, even though I had just bought a new Silver edition.Beware of blackberry because its hardware seems to not be able to perform basic functions!",2016年4月14日 在美国审核
My first smart phone was iPhone 5,"My first smart phone was iPhone 5, very good except for 4"" screen and storage; I ran out of 16GB memory to the point of not being able to update the OS.2nd phone was 32GB Nexus 5, with great secondary GPS (I mainly use Garmin), and absolutely horrible battery; I ran out of power daily with minimal use (mostly email and some Viber), and expert advice to me was to turn off most of the services (basically the whole phone) to save battery.It puts a very bitter taste of Android to me which I will stay away in the near future.I don't play games nor watch movies.BB Passport has the best battery, the best voice quality, and the widest screen to see emails, PDF, legal documents, at any price (among phones).Viber doesn't work on this, there's no free RPN calculators for it, but I don't care; I know if I need to call, there is still battery power (by that time, Nexus 5 would be dead, or near dead with developer mode disabling most services) and I can clearly hear / understand what the other party is saying.A phone has to have clear voice, viewable without scrolling left and right continuously, and most importantly, not dead!As to why I didn't pick iPhone 6+, I can add 128GB to Passport, and I bought iPad Air 2 with 128GB since I liked my old iPad 2 32GB so much.I still own/use everything I mentioned in this review, with Nexus 5 SIM card moved to Passport.",2015年5月14日 在美国审核
Wondering about other stars...,"Well, I guess, to each is own! Of course I read the one and three star reviews because I already understood the 5 and 4 stars!

The Passport Physical keyboard is just an awesome experience even compare to other Blackberry devices! The PassportWorks does not freeze like other phones not saying any names!

Truly remarkable device. Thank you Blackberry.,"I bought the blackberry passport almost a year and a half back, soon after it first launched. I use it to this day and i can tell you this one is a keeper. I have previously owned iPhones and Nexus, so I was very familiar with the ios and the android platforms. Jumping to BB OS during the declining years of Blackberry was seen as lunacy by friends and family. However, its been such an amazing experience with this passport that a couple of my friends have also switched to blackberry purely based on my passport experience :)Everything this device does, it does extremely well. Its fabulous design commands respect and makes you stand out in a good way. Several people have stopped to ask me about this device. Never had such an experience with either the ios or the android ones. The call quality is fantastic. The battery life is superb. Even with heavy use, the battery easily gets me through the day and then some. The hub is a productivity masterpiece. The keyboard is exceptional. At work, I rarely use the laptop to send emails. Even with the laptop in front of me, i find responding with my blackberry passport a lot faster and so much more convenient. The camera is fantastic and does quite well even in low light situations. The 1:1 screen ratio is great for emails, documents, maps and such. Not so great for videos. The expandable memory is a welcome feature and saves me a lot of time from having to free up space every now and then. Even with 2 years of use, the device hasn't slowed down and still looks brand new, which says a lot about how well its been designed and manufactured.As for the apps, i missed having google maps. I found a way to side-load google play store and installed google maps. Works really well, navigation n all. So what I missed, there is a hack for that which is just what the doctor ordered.In sum, i'm so glad i've made the switch to the Blackberry passport. Its just a class apart. Unfortunately, companies and app makers alike have ditched BB support to a large extent due to the small market share, driving a further decline in market share, forcing BB users to ditch the platform. However, it doesn't take away from the fact that this device embodies great engineering innovation in device construction, hardware and software aspects. From a fellow engineer, kudos to the blackberry passport engineering team. This is a product y'all should be damn proud of!",2016年5月19日 在美国审核

Exceeded all expectations.,"First off I want to say that I'm a 20 year old college student and I LOVE this phone. So no, it's not just for CEO's and workaholics.I've been a die hard BlackBerry fangirl from the second I laid my thumbs on their keyboard. After my first BlackBerry that I had for about 3 years finally died, I got a Galaxy S3 and it was okay but NOTHING compared to any BlackBerry. Once that died (after about 8 months, mind you.), I went to the Q10 and the ONLY reason I switched phones was for the Passport. My Q10 was still going strong. I just got my Passport a few days ago after waiting so long for it.A lot of people talk about the awkward layout of the Passport's keyboard. I will be the first to admit that it took me a quick minute to get used to, but now that I am, I love it. It got rid of some keys to give us a bigger screen, and I appreciate that as well as enjoy it.The phone itself is a beast of a phone. I've always been amazed at the sheer power of a BlackBerry. I am so proud to walk around with this thing. I've had it all of 4 days and I've had 17 inquires about my phone. (Yes, I'm keeping track.)One thing that I really didn't expect is the amazing sound quality. I know it's not important to a lot of people, but it's a very pleasant surprise. With your Passport you get a set of headphones, which are flatwire (AMAZING), and really, really good quality as well as very comfortable.Overall, this one is everything I wanted and much more. I am very pleased with my purchase and I'm sure I'll be happy with it for a long time.",2015年2月19日 在美国审核
It's a clear winner!,I write this as a former iphone and BlackBerry user...this phone is so different than all the boring slabs of glass you see in cell shops these days - what a breathe of fresh air! The built quality is even better than recent BlackBerry phone and is 'premium' in every way. It feels solid and comfortable in your hands although one handed use is somewhat limited for those with small hands. The screen is simply stunning with bright backlighting and color rendering. Photos are great....even Netflix is surprisingly good to watch on this phone. The call clarity is way ahead (particularly the speakerphone option!)....never heard a better one. The keyboard takes a little getting used to but the predictive type and capacitive features are amazing...give it a couple days and you'll wonder how you got by without it. 32 gigs on board and add a 128 gig card for more memory than anything on the market. The 10.3 software has so many intuitive and useful functions that I missed from earlier BlackBerry phone - thank-you!!Major thumbs up to BlackBerry for producing a true standout at a fair price,2014年10月6日 在美国审核
Greatest Phone I have Ever Used!,"People ask me all the time, ""Isn't BlackBerry dead?"", ""Didn't they stop making phones?"" I politely answer them, ""No, they are not dead. And, yes, they are still making phones. In fact, they make great phones!""The Passport is the evidence to my bold claim. The Passport is the best BlackBerry ever to be produced, and it is the best phone I have ever used in my life time.On this site, there are several skeptical posts whether of not some of the positive reviews for this phone have been doctored or sponsored by BlackBerry. If you believe that my review falls into that category, please check out my twitter account @kwakster928 for my twits about my experience with the phone.The specs of the phone have been talked about to the level of ad nauseum. I am happy to report the hardware provided with the phone is stellar and heavy users will not have trouble using the device at its full capacity. Rather than talk about topics that are already known, I will focus my review on key features of the phone specific to the device.Keyboard and Tactile Gestures:BlackBerry has been known for producing the best mobile qwerty keyboard in the market. The passport's keyboard doesn't disappoint. But, I cannot say this is the best BlackBerry keyboard I have ever used.The three row keyboard requires a significant amount of learning curve. Even after about a month use, I occasionally struggle with placement of B and V keys placed right next to the space bar. Integration of virtual keys on top of the physical keys works well, but I would have preferred the physical keys with an alt button instead.Tactile gestures included in the keyboard is the most innovative feature I have seen in a mobile phone. It works well most of the time. But I have seen troubles in cold weather. It is also easy to hit the virtual keyboard when swiping up. Scrolling feature is joy to use but it is not universal across all applications.The most useful feature of the keyboard in my opinion, is the ability to bring up the fine control cursor with a double tap on the keyboard. I have used countless number of all touch devices where trying to put a word between two words is an excruciating experience. This is not the case with the Passport. It works best when you initially tap the screen in the vicinity of the correction and use the keyboard to move the cursor left or right. Going up and down rows with the fine cursor doesn't work as well.The big positive is that 99.5% of the time when you are using the phone, the combination of the virtual keys, swiping up to select predictive text, and physical keyboard is wonderful experience you just have to try. After about a month, your fingers will fully adapt to the keyboard layout (with occasional hiccups) and you will be swiping away to select words and delete words. Your eyes will be focusing on the screen and the content you are creating, rather than glue to the virtual keyboard trying to see what keys you are pressing.Form Factor:Square screen may seem odd to many people, but I cannot believe that the other manufacturers have not thought about this before. Wide screen gives the users ability to consume content in much more efficient manner. Reading email, pdf documents and ebooks are incredibly easy on your eyes. Combine that with less need for scrolling and using the keyboard when scrolling is needed, you may ask yourself, how the heck did I live without it before.On the other hand, consuming video is less than optimal, since most of the videos are 16:9 ratio. You will see black bars on top and bottom of the screen but if you are type of person who doesn't watch hours of netflix on the phone, I think the Passport more than delivers.LED Notifications:I think this is a hidden gem no one really talks about with BlackBerry. With BlackBerry OS and third party apps like BeBuzz and Hub++, you can customize color and pattern of LED notifications to each application, contact, or both. This is an amazing feature I cannot live without. In the meetings, I have the phone silent and vibration off but LED active. When a notification comes, I can tell without turning on the phone, what type of notification it is(email, text, or phone call) from whom.Apps:The Achilles's hill of BlackBerry is less than stellar application economy. Many of the popular apps like Snapchat, Instagram, or Netflix are absent from the BlackBerry app store. BlackBerry managed to close the gap by adding the amazon app store, but that too may bot be sufficient for the heavy app users. By using Snap, you can attempt to download popular apps available in google app store, but you will find that any apps requiring google play account may not run. In addition, most of the apps are not sized for the Passport 's square screen, limiting the full experience.I am not a heavy app user. I have a couple of social media apps, and news and sports apps. For apps that I use, I found suitable replacement in the BlackBerry app store or was able to download them through either snap or amazon.Be warned, if you live and die by the apps, stick with the iOS or the Android.BlackBerry OS:If you are new to the BlackBerry OS, it is not the old clunky BlackBerry OS you have accustomed. It is the modern OS with loaded features. Interface is clean and modern. Gesture base system is easy and joy to navigate with. Integrated inbox, the hub, is another feature I cannot live without, and it is executed flawlessly. Some people complained that the inbox can be overwhelming with multiple accounts but you can choose to turn on and off the accounts based on your needs.It is however without faults. It has some major bugs and requires a restart time to time. But, number of bugs and restart is no greater than the other mobile OS.Overall Impression:If you use your phone for work and for getting stuff done, do not look anywhere else. This phone is designed just for you. Disregard the square screen and one hand use. All the faults and skepticism you may had for this phone will evaporate once you realize how much you can accomplish with this phone. This is not a phone for average consumer. Consider it as a working tool. If you buy the phone expect it as such, you will not be disappointed. But if you use the phone as playing games, watching movies, or check your emails occasionally, you will throw away this phone in disgust.For me, for my needs, this is the best phone I have ever used and it is the best BlackBerry the company has ever produced period!",2014年11月23日 在美国审核

There is also news about the BB Classic to be launched sometime soon, but I think the Passport is a clear winner here.

Incredible product,"To start off, I consider myself a very tech savvy person and don't have any bias towards any device or company.

Just to clue in iPhone users in on the power capacity of this device (I call it a device because it does far more than a phone does), you can listen to YouTube videos/songs while browsing the rest of the phone including texting and additional Web surfing. BTW the BlackBerry Hub is incredibly organized. I have completely put aside my laptop and Kindle (sorry Amazon). My average battery life, meaning constant nonstop usage, is around 20 hours.Also what poor iPhone users have been deprived of for years (I used to be one of them); the ability to YouTube convert songs all on the device itself. No cords or computers necessary. You heard right. Grab the link, go on over to any YouTube converting website and convert within seconds, save to device, and enjoy.And by the way, this beast is sooooooooo fast.

"Don't let the haters fool you, it's a great phone.","Here's how it goes with this phone: I mention something about ""my BlackBerry"", at which point the person or people start to snicker and say, ""BlackBerry still makes phones?"" or ""BlackBerry? Are we in the 90's?"" or some such insult. And then I pull out my Passport Silver Edition and start showing it off, and they say, ""Oh, that's actually pretty nice."" Etc. Love this phone. It's a little too big for one-handed typing, but we're really not supposed to be texting and driving anyway, right? Snap is easy to load (just get onto the Crackberry forums and search for instructions or advice, there's lots of help there), so I have all my banking apps, travel apps, etc. Unfortunately, it doesn't run Google play services, so some features of some apps don't play along. Blackberry's native apps like BB Travel and Remember are really very good, although I find the Contacts app to be a bit confusing or glitchy sometimes. And as others say, the Hub is just awesome. I'm probably biased, because Blackberry is the underdog these days, and I love to root for the underdog, but for my use - primarily as a communication device - it's perfect.

unique phone experience,"First thing, this unlocked phone doesn't work with straight talk. Work well with att. This is an amazing phone. I am using for a week now and am in love with it. Like phone with iPad. Little slow than other phones. But great to use.highly recommend....",2017年9月3日 在美国审核
No other phone even comes close!,"To be honest with you I had my doubts when I started using the phone for the very first time. But now that I have had it for close to five months, I can't even think of using any other hand held device (tablets included!). Even my new IPad feels slow and outdated compared to this phone.First off, the shape factor is much better improvement than what I thought. The screen resolution is great and reading documents, spread sheets and web pages is actually a pleasure.The phone OS is lighting fast and very solid. I have not restarted the phone even once since I bought it to remove a bug.The new features like Blend that allows you check and send emails or messages through your PC or tablet is great but to be honest, I enjoy typing on the phone even more.The keyboard takes some time to master, but when you get used to it, you won't go back to touch keyboard.The added connectivity like One drive, The box and external drive support (yes! you can use an adapter to connect it to flash or external hard drive) has made it even more productive than my tablet PC. I can afford to not have my tablet PC with me but I'm lost without my passport.Camera is great. I don't see the need to bring my DSLR with me anymore unless I need some really tricky contrast or dynamic range adjustments.And finally, the android runtime works great. You can install any (and I mean any) android app that you want and it will work perfectly. Just install the Snap on your phone which is an interface for Google Play and then you have access to all of the android apps. So don't let the ""Lack of apps"" myth hold you back.I remember someone said Passport is like wine that becomes better and better with time. What a true statement! I definitely recommend this phone to anybody.",2015年10月7日 在美国审核
Made the switch and not looking back,"In the past year I've gone from a BlackBerry Z10, to a Samsung S4, to the iPhone 5, and now just this past week I've come full circle and am now back with a BlackBerry--only this time now it's a Passport. The experience I've had in the last few days with my Passport has been amazing. The keyboard is a dream, and the screen size and resolution is incredible. The Amazon Appstore comes pre-loaded and helps fill the void from the lack of apps in BlackBerry World. Many people question the size of the device and wonder if it's too big. I'm a female with small hands and it's not an issue for me at all. Finally I have a smartphone that allows me to get my work done.

The best phone I owned,"I've been lucky to have many cell phones, including iphones, Ipad and android. For work, I used to have a blackberry (latest one the Q10) but for some time now I've had to complement that with a second personnal phone. I was about to renew my pro subscription and change for a samsung, when I saw the passport. I decided to wait to get it, and how happy am I that I did it.All the positive reviews are true: form factor is great for business use - and not too big (goes into my pants pockets, and I can actually make some basic use one-handed although not typing messages). Works great. compatibility with android (amazon store or snap) means most applications there are available (many through snap don't work though, so not saying you've got the full android experience).What I really love is the interface (square screen and very efficient keyboard), which means I've dropped for the first time my paper notepad to take notes. And the extra long battery life makes a big difference as well.I also use blackberry blend quite a lot. Allows me to use the passport as the center for all messages (including sms etc.) and control it remotely from my computer when working. The blend software has a few minor bugs and will certainly improve in features, but already quite nice.Couldn't be happier!",2014年11月24日 在美国审核

The build of the phone is solid and you do not need a rolling pin to unbend your phone like the other brand. Comparing the spec in terms of storage it has 32G and you can go 128GB and beyond with this phone. The audio is the best that you can find right now. And with the BlackBerry Blend you can use it on your tablet and your computer without leaving data and files footprint on them. Forget about the business and professional aspect of it. Angry Birds and Candy Crush never look so good on the clear and crisp screen not to mention the sound. And both of these apps you can download from amazon apps store. Forget about looking for a wall outlet to charge your phone. This thing can last more than 24 hours of use.

My home and on the road computer,"I think I was one of the first users in Hong Kong, got my hands on it since Oct 20 and I have to say this phone is absolutely amazing. I've seen many reviews prior to my purchase and they all sound like made up reviews done by blackberry employees, but let me tell you they are stating the facts. The fact that I'm able to store all of my files on the phone like a USB thumb without any requirement of an app to open it is already the game changer for me (when compared to iphone). I have files that need updating on the fly on a daily basis and a normal smart phone with its rectangular screen doesn't work for me, esp when viewing docs and spreadsheets, the extension through the blend software is a bonus. On the battery side, I hear people going on 2 days but it's more like 1.5 for me, perhaps I depend on it (use it) too much everyday? One negative point I will say is the camera focus does not work very well, the focus just doesn't seem to focus sometimes even though i press it a few times (blackberry, looking forward to a fix!!), when it does work the photos are really nice, even in low light environments.

Great phone! Good job BlackBerry!,"Switched to Passport from Google Nexus running Lollipop, their latest OS. I was so tired of Android, it had many glitches and used to constantly crash on me! Also was tired with the ocean of rectangular glass slabs currently being sold in the market. Was desperate to buy something that not only meets my need of having a powerful and seemless communication device, but also had the apps that I really need to keep my day going. And, Passport seemed to offer me all these needs based on what I read and thankfully I am getting what I read! It's been over a month since I bought this phone and I couldn't be any happier to have bought this phone! Good job blackberry! I think BlackBerry should seriously improve the marketing of its phones! These phones are so much more powerful than the sick iSheeps and Lollipoops, but people are still going for those rectangular crap probably because they might not be aware how much BlackBerry phones have improved side their old Curves and other BlackBerry OS 6 &amp; 7 phones that were actually inferior to the competing phones.

"Brilliant, should've tought about this","This device is the best on so many levels.It's blazing fast, battery is unstoppable, the screen is astonishing. And you can't say the shape and design of it didn't got your attention.Writing real e-mails with any attachment Is a walk through the park.Built-in features by Blackberry brings you a very complete all around selection to pretty much do anything. One of my favorite features on it is the Hub makes it so much easier for using any daily app you use.Photo quality is very good, sometimes you might need to wait a quarter of a second for the focus to focus ;) but the result will be worth it. The pre-installed photo editor from BlackBerry does some pretty neat upscaling, if you want to bring them to the next level i'd suggest the Photo Studio PRO app.Could go on about how awesome the Passport is but do find it out by yourself.Welcome to a whole new world of mobility",2015年5月31日 在美国审核

It Is The Best Smartphone,"This is truly the best phone for my needs.I started using smartphones in 2006 with a BlackBerry 8800, before the iPhone was available.Then I switched to iPhone for faster web browsing and usable GPS. The iPhone was okay for consuming content (reading stuff), but it was impractical to respond to emails or create any contents (writing a paper, etc) that I used to do on my BlackBerry. I was pretty good at typing on the iPhone glass, but not for a long email - really missed the BlackBerry keyboard.I have been using the Passport for a few days now and I am in love with this device.Things that I like:Screen is crisp and vibrant (better than any other phone I looked at including the iPhone 6).The keyboard takes a while to get familiar, but after a few hours I was cruising on the hybrid keyboard. Love it.Speed. This is an extremely fast phone.Battery life. Never needed to charge at work all day.Web browser is even better than on my new MacBook Pro. It is fast and the web pages display just like the desktop, full content and you can do things that you normally could with a desktop browser.Productivity Apps. I was able to write papers using Docs to Go, sign contracts with Adobe Acrobat, and gave presentations all with preloaded Apps.BBM is a good App, but great on the Passport with the extra space.BB10 is just amazing. I can talk on the phone while browsing the web, transition to email in the Hub, then back all occurring simultaneously and smoothy with one swipe per action (no need for home button).Hub, this is a messaging center. The best inbox I have ever used (including desk top computers).Cell signal is stronger than any other phone. My office is in a large building with very weak signal. My iPhone was completely useless in it. Now I have 3 bars and phone calls have never dropped once yet. Amazing...Looks. This phone looks sexy and professional.Camera. I don't use much, but have taken some great pictures with it. It is a 13 mega pixel camera.Sound is fantastic, best of all the phones I tested. Now I can finally listen to music on a phone.The list can go on longer, but those are some of the features most people care about. Oh, the Apps, the Passport comes preloaded with Amazon Apps Store. I downloaded a few Android apps and games and they all worked fine.It seemed a little big when I first opened it, but there isn't anything that I don't like about it now.Hope this helps.

This is the One....... After Years of Searching.,"This is my first Amazon review in all of the years of using the service. I actually have the AT&amp;T variant of the phone, and am also going to post a review on their website. I have owned everything over the years. Android, Windows, ios, and other Blackberrys. I love cell phones and the technology that comes with it. All I can say is that this is as close to having everything I want and need on a smart phone that I have ever found. It's the first phone that has not left me frustrated in any way, and I actually feel like it's a useful life tool. This phone makes me want to communicate with others. It makes me want to know my schedule down to the hour of every day. I came to the realization a while ago that I don't want my phone to be my game cosole and video player. Life is just way to busy to be distracted in the middle of my work day. If I want to play games or watch videos then I can always reach for my tablet, a device that is meant for media consumption and time wasting. So if your looking for a productivity, communication, business machine, look no further. On the other hand, if your afraid to step out and be a little different, but with huge results, then stick with what's popular but truly subpar compared to what my be the best mobile device ever made.",2015年5月27日 在美国审核

Blackberry Passport rocks,"This phone is amazing !!!I've been using BB for business for last 8 years or so. I've started with the blackberry 7210 with a convenient roller at the side, and went thru most next models - curve, bold and finished with this one. BB keeps great business focus with their phone line. Each model contained new features, so that email ,calendar, corporate Instant Messenger, intranet worked amazingly. it is the same with Passport. The message Hub allows to see all activities in one place, it is highy configurable (multiple email accounts could be marked each in different color, or filtered out). The sliding capability of the phone and gestures on keyboard are extremely useful and speed up the work.it took me several days to learn the new keyboard layout (i got it mid-March), but now i can write emails without looking at the keyboard again.i saw various comments about the battery life - here Passport stands out in the smartphone arena - my average battery life is 3 days. it was up to 4 days range earlier, but is started to install more apps and have bluetooth switched on most of the times.as for the applications - you could install them from BB World (small selection), Amazon store (nice large selection) and if you install SNAP you could use google play store !!!no limits. i've just installed FitBit application on my BB, and it is syncing with the health band, and shows the dashboard.and last but not least - the screen.the resolution is outstanding - i use phone to review documents or presentations and you can read it easily.i'm not into pictures too much, but several which i did with the phone were ok. BB has some compensation algorithms built in, but since i use it hardly often it is totally sufficient.there is actually one thing that stopped working, when i moved from the 9790 - i cannot see the availability of other employees in the calendar anymore (when i create a meeting invite). I've learned that this feature depends on upgrade of corporate Microsoft Exchange to newer version. And this is pity, as it worked in Bold 9790, but does not work in Passport....",2015年4月19日 在美国审核
Form is not appropriate for a mobile phone,"I switched to this phone from Nokia Lumia 925. I was attracted by its design for professionals, extended battery life , solid built and good reviews on Blackberry 10 OS. I am not going to write a lengthy review because the form factor was definitely a deal breaker. This phone is so wide that it is very awkward to use it as a phone. The marginal advantage of the wide screen is not worth the bulk you carry. Blackberry 10 is nice because you can run android apps but otherwise it is much more clunky and poorly designed as compared to Windows OS. In my opinion Windows OS is the best on market. The real challenge for Microsoft is whether they will be able to follow the line of Nokia to manufacture high-quality sleek hardware.",2014年12月23日 在美国审核

BlackBerry Passport,"The BlackBerry Passport has the perfect size screen. There is no need for scrolling back and forth to read. Just pinch and expand or shrink to whatever you want, and the entire width of the document or article can be easily read since it is a wide square screen-the article fits to the screen and is easily readable. More of an entire article/ document/ chart/ graph/ excel / maps can be seen on this phone than other phones, all while being held in the normal upright position. The physical and virtual keyboards are great. The sound quality is unbeatable. Music, phone calls, conference calls, scanner radio, you tube,and apps on speaker phone or otherwise are outstanding. I've even had people ask me where the speakers are that my phone is hooked up to. The sound is loud and clear, not only that, if the caller is also on a BlackBerry I can hear the background conversations perfectly. BlackBerry just provides better sound qualityin their cell phones. If you are on a call and you don't want other people to hear the conversation, take it off speaker phone, then even in a quiet environmentthe BlackBerry conversation cannot be heard by others unlike other cell phones that somehow are easily heard by other people. Maybe that's part of their privacy and security features. BlackBerry Quality, productivity, Security and Convenience! There are many settings and options on the Passport that are not available on other phones (including the iphone which I am forced to use daily). The Passport option to stop a ringing phone by placing it face down is quick and convenient. I can have 50+ tabs open for browsing the Web plus have other tabs open on the private browser, while talking on the phone and using maps, or whatever other apps I want to use all at the same time. The multi-tasking is incredible. It charges quickly and holds the charge. There are so many more advantages I just can't fit them all here.

Lovely design but disappointing fuctionality,"I love the design on this one, but obviously Blackberry and app designers have given up on upgrades, since almost none of the apps for this actually work. I live in China, where you can't function without things like Wechat and Alipay, and those simply don't work any more on Passport. It ends up being a very, very nice device for writing emails in bed in the morning. But I can't carry it around without taking a second phone with me for Wechat etc. It's pretty expensive for something with such limited utility. I hope Blackberry has the good sense to re-release this design with Android one of these years.",2018年8月3日 在美国审核
BlackBerry Rules,I have used every flagship phone from every OS and nothing has really satisfied me until I started using a blackberry passport. It is everything from the HUB (which is genius) to the qwerty keyboard that cant be matched! The phone is smooth and NEVER have to reset the phone due to lag or locking up like every other OS does. Takes about a week to learneverything about the gestures and such but once you get it down it is such a productivity device!,2015年8月18日 在美国审核
Hi quality product,"Have been using BBerry phones since 7320which is 2002... Passport is a powerful communicator with, the usual, fantastic and incredibly fast BBerry physical keyboard, very fast processor, strong photo and video camera and very sharp, quite large square screen.

Upgraded from an all touch device to Passport!,"I really love this device and weirdly enough I preached how I would never return to a keyboard device.Pros:- Feels very good in the hand; makes more sense as a two handed device but one hand use still doable.- Display is gorgeous and picture/video quality is excellent.- Upgrading from an all touch, the typing transition takes some getting use to obviously but after a day of use -- good to go. I'm upgrading from the Z10, so i love that the key is touch sensitive to gestures i.e. flick up word suggestions etc.- Love the zoom-in/out option for android apps; useful on apps not built responsive to varying screen dimensions.- Battery life is amazing. Avg 1 day and 10 hours with heavy use.- Unrelated to hardware, but the Blackberry Blend app works seamless and does everything as advertised well.- Sound quality is great over voice calls/BBM/music etc.- Comes with 10.3 OS, lots a new features/legacy features are included.- Amazon app store is conveniently loaded out of the box (I still mostly use Snap -- it's a Google Play app store client)Cons:- Currently, not all android apps support this form factor.- At the moment, the keyboard cant be used as a track pad on the home screen i.e. swiping through the app drawer.

Great phone!,"I have Z30 touch phone which I love. However, I wanted a Passport for my home inspection business because I send and receive lots of emails. I also run a home inspection report app (an android app called HG Companion, THE PHONE RUNS ANDROID APPS!!), where I thought the wide format would work well. I planned to keep the Z30 for games, music and personal stuff. However, I find myself neglecting the Z30 in favor of the Passport. Give yourself a few days to get acquainted because it is different from any other phone out there. It is big but not unmanageable. Two hands to type but you can manage the touch screen with one hand reasonably well unless you have small hands. Best new feature is capacitive keyboard with word prediction. Hub and BB10 operating system beats ios and android easily and gets better with each release. Twenty minutes at the store won't convince you.

"huge improvement over previous passport even if it is only aesthetic.  solid and well-built phone, elegant, and fast.","i was thinking about buying a passport since it first came out, but always held back of some poor decisions (in my opinion) about the sharp corners, the 'look' of the rear facing camera, rear finish 'rubber look' that bothered me in addition to the fact the leather flip case had to be glued to the back of the phone!anyway, this version of the passport fixed all those issues and more, and is a true masterpiece.every aspect of the previous version has been perfected and re-engineered into a top notch package.once this phone was released, it only took me a few days to sell my previous phone (blackberry classic) and buy it.absolutely beautiful phone.if the previous version of the passport was a toyota, this one is a lexus.and speaking of cars, even though it comes with a built-in gps / navigation app i also 'sideloaded' the APK for google maps and makes a great GPS unit with that large square screen when mounted on the dashboard.BTW any bb10 phone will run almost any almost any android app version 4.3 (jellybean) or less not requiring googleplay, via a sideloaded APK file.its simply a matter of downloading the APK file to your blackberry and a 'click' in file manager.thanks blackberry for your commitment to excellence and bringing this device to the market!",2015年9月1日 在美国审核

At first the keyboard feels stiff and different from touch screen, once you get used to that, just like it. Running is smooth and fast. The screen is sharp. I sideloaded SNAP to run Google apps.

I've been converted....,"What a sincerely amazing phone....I've been using android devices pretty much since they came out, Samsung Nexus, Samsung Note II, LG Optimus, HTC One, and S4, but I've never really been happy with the android OS, it does nothing for the user, its more like a loose patchwork of apps, with no real integration. I also tried an Apple iPhone 5 too, way to locked down for my liking, messaging and typing were terrible, browser was slow compared to the S4.I was open to trying BB10 based on what I had heard about it, but the two android apps I completely rely on were not available so it was a no go. That changed with the release of BB 10.3.1. I was skeptical, I tried sideloading before the update on a Z10 I picked up and android apps were just not functioning properly, with my new Passport (bought from Telus) and with the updated BB10 every android app I have tried works, most importantly my two important apps work flawlessly, in fact with the larger screen they are even better!The phone is not too big, it feels very nice in my hands, I'm only 5'9"" with average sized hands, and both me and my wife think it feels perfect, its not top heavy, its not awkward to hold, and the two handed typing on the keyboard is a joy. The speed, quality and overall experience of this phone has truly set it apart, there is nothing like it, and in my estimation it is a game changer pure and simple. Excel spread sheets, android apps, speakers that sound like a mini stereo, a screen that's nothing short of flawless, 36 hour battery life..... Blackberry hit a grand slam with this one.

Great new update.,"Perhaps I'm a bit late in the game on getting this passport. I mean, I've held off on blackberry since my purchase of the blackberry torch and I will explain why in the following paragraph and review:the blackberry torch ... Did withstand falling down a two story flight of stairs and bouncing without a case, it also did withstand falling in a tub and using the rice trick... But the software was so glitchy that I went from blackberry to iPhone 4s, then 5s, then onto the 6plus. Which I have now and absolutely adore by the way.(I will post a photo screen shot from my Instagram of my iPhone 6 plus and my blackberry passport side by side).Moving on. I use the iPhone six plus as my main phone with sprint. Which trust me it's a mess and hassle trying to not get charged a leasing fee even though I paid in full for my phone. I have to call back every month and get the 35$ removed. But that's another story.I also have a prepaid ATT plan which is 45$ for unlimited everything.I initially had a windows phone but been looking for something Better and more versatile.I would be using it for not only emergencies but business as needed. Then I remebered how I missed having a keypad. Oh the days of the blackberry keyboard.I remember them fondly. Plus BBM?Plus I know someone who writes for crack berry and he raves about the passport and insisted I get it ages upon ages ago when it released.So I dished out the 600$ plus tax for a white blackberry passport - as my prepaid phone.First of all it takes a nano sim card so I needed to go to ATT physically to get one of those. They were in awe with my phone. They haven't seen one in person. So that was that and my phone was activated.Initially I went to send text and try the keyboard. Was a bit awkward since I use the iPhone 6 plus but doable and nice. The hub was a nice feature too. Swipe to the left all the way and all your email, calls. Text, everything. All in one place. I then went on to try YouTube. I love youtube. Worked perfect.But then i realized in the realm of apps it's not so fun.No Instagram. No Amazon. Most the things I have become accustomed to using were not in the store for purchase.But then I remembered this was my spare phone so I shouldn't get too upset.Honestly, for a work phone this is amazing. Easy to manage everything you need.For play and apps this isn't gonna be your cup of tea. I adore he touch screen and the size of the screen and the keyboard and with that said I'm happy to have this as a unlocked phone which is prepaid. I can use it for my spare but switch to my main at any time.",2015年1月2日 在美国审核

Other bad reviews were written by people who'd clearly spent virturally no time on the device. Still others were written by people who sounded like lonely little trolls.

"Still completely marvelled, crystal?","I remember when I first saw the passport in a magazine review. Instantly I fell in love and knew that one day I'd have one of my very own. How completely fortunate I was to be able to purchase one a little over a month after the dashing stainless steel redesign release. Talking aesthetic appeal, this device offers a clean and forward statement. The large screen surprises many and still surprises me. I honestly forget that I'm looking at a phone at times -but that's a good thing. Such as it is, a testament to the wide and open screen, I can't help but feel released and not so congested as I had been with my previous phone. The accessory buttons are firm and solid. The keypad is clean, especially with the touch screen integration, and quite a pleasure to use -though I can't seem to find a tab button. I've read many compliments to the diamond textured backing that don't really compare to how comforted I feel about the beveled edges in the steel unibody. Really, I'm getting to the point of how this phone feels in my hands. For many, their initial thought is going to be ""Wow, is that going to feel alright in my grip?"". I too was not completely sure if when I received the phone that I would truly love holding it. And this is the truth to any phone, that everyday you are going to be holding this object that contributes to your sense of self and your confidence in that. Boy, I tell ya! The width of the phone causes my grip to be wide and strong when maneuvering. The thickness of the steel frame gives my left index a durable, secure footing and those beveled edges make for a seamless yet defined tactile understanding of the power and efficiency made into the Passport running BlackBerry OS ten. Maybe it's just me, but my last phone always had me on edge as to whether or not it was wriggling it's way out of my pocket while I sat. The Passport has nearly completely dissolved that anxiety. I've yet to have it fall out of my pocket and even while I try not to, running with the device on me feels far more secure than my previous phone. The point being made here is that the Passport is larger, stronger, and far more of a heavyweight compared to other limp, cheap plastic framed wannabe powerhouse smart phones. Yes, you will have to use two hands to get the best out of it but, I assure you, the grand feeling of strength that comes from handling such a concrete and crystal cut design will not only make two hand use a delight yet will also work to make your day concrete and crystal cut.",2015年9月21日 在美国审核

My experience as an android user...,"I am really impressed with what blackberry has done with this phone. It's fast, easy to use and different from everything that's on the market.First about me...I am a college student and I have always used an Android device. My last phone was a LG g2. I use my phone for texting, surfing the web, YouTube and (like every college student nowadays) take notes, write small essays, open many files( most .doc), and listen to music. I don't play a lot of games.Honestly, I bought this device because its different. I wanted to try something different, I was getting bored of the android interface. I was a bit skeptical about buying this phone since everyone says BB is dead. My surprises that this phone is pretty good...Since I own this phone I am using less my tablet and even my laptop. The screen is so wide that you can see much more than a regular smartphone. I don't use a lot of apps, but now with the amazon app store, almost every important app is there, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube etc... (except for Google service apps).Battery life is... very very good. I have been able to get 2 days of battery life with regular use (not playing games). The speakers are awesome, nothing compared to iPhones or Samsung. The camera is also very good. Pictures have a square shape (like Instagram) but picture quality and color saturation are very good ( similar to my old G2).In conclusion, this is a very impressive phone. I wasn't expecting this from BB. If what you want is a phone to be productive, excellent battery life and different from what everybody else carries, this is the best on the market. Even tough there are a lot of apps in BB now, if you are a heavy app user (specially games) and cannot leave the Google world, you should stay with Android or Apple.",2014年9月26日 在美国审核

"Great phone - may be the best, but nothing is perfect!","Large screen - I have stopped carrying laptop for 2-3 day trips. Also Less need to use ipad.Long lasting battery - for me 48 hours as I disable many features. No need to carry chargers on 1 night / 2 day trips. Easily lasts 24 hours duringheavy duty use when travelling.Large memory - I added a 128GB micro-SD card. All my music/data files, contacts/calendars, photos - accumulated to now nearly 100GB in last 8-10 years (since the time of Nokia Communicator - well before Blackberry came into existence!) comfortably stored now on Passport. I am no longer confined to living room for listening music on ipod+speaker with acceptable sound.For me, Blackberry OS is the only wayto sync contacts/calendar with Outlook on desktop because* for Windows/Android have to give up data under Microsoft/Google control for sync via Windows Live/Gmail.* iOS for me always failed to sync 8,000+ contacts/calendar entries that I have.* Symbian Devices are no longer available.Built-in support for DOC/XLS/PDF/PPT files and File Manager as has always been the case with Blackberry, but not iOS. No idea about Android.Blackberry Blend could successfully connect with the handset after I unblocked ip6 traffic on F-Secure.Blackberry Link syncs well - contacts/calendar. I didn't like data file sync interface. Its easier to copy/paste.Teamviewer also installed successfully - but yet to try using it out.Kindle books are now also on Passport.There are some other good/bad features - as follows - but they shouldn't affect buying decision:-* Quick reboot - several times faster than Z10!* Data Management to control data usage - no use for me as I have unlimited plan.* Lift to wake, flip to mute - I don't use.* Device monitor helps find what feature/app hogs up battery or data.* My device reboots automatically when playing specific parts of specific songs! Never happened with ipod, WinXp, Win7 on same song/part.* Handsfree and media speaker sound quality is excellent, but not earpiece sound quality.* Fewer Apps?

A great phone,"No other smartphone in the market does multitasking as a BlackBerry 10 unit, and the Passport takes everything good in the OS to a whole new level. It is fast, it gas a great hub, it allows up to 8 apps open and now works with BlackBerry and Android apps almost flawlessly. The 1440x1440 px screen is great, just like the touch sensitive keyboard.It takes a couple of days to get used to its form and its strange keyboard, but once you do, every other smartphone will look simple and featureless in comparison.

A Steep But Fruitful Learning Curve.,"Coming from older model Blackberrys, the Passport (to me) had a steep learning curve as it uses solely screen swipes to access different functions (however with the advantage of having a dedicated QWERTY keyboard for texting and emails). Nevertheless with patience it pays off as this phone is light years ahead of previous Blackberrys. I would hope Blackberry would consider issuing an updated classic model of the Passport.",2018年2月18日 在美国审核

I installed Blackmart which is another app store or just google search for whichever app I want by typing its name followed by apk! The vast majority work, but some need google services which are not available. The phone is a little too heavy and to my mind could have been faster. But overall it is wonderful tool. I can work, edit documents and email, much much better than with other android or apple devices. Only issue was not having all the apps I needed, but as mentioned, this is not much of a problem anymore.

Update.First Impressions,"Update:5/15I love this phone. It's such a convenience to have. I have gotten use to the keyboard and feel more invincible. This is the blackberry on steroids I've been looking for.Previous concerns:No back button- still miss it but have gotten to the fact that this is a two handed device. I have gotten use to the back button on the left hand side and have gotten use to having no blackberry belt.Google Play is available on the passport- get it, don't hesitate.Phone size-still feels awkward when making calls but I can't complain about anything else.When playing videos there are black bars like watching wide screenThey dont play a factor in my opinion.Battery: Awesome.Conclusion:This is a two handed phone so be prepared to use it with two hands. It's made to be used and worked on. I am in love with this phone. Five stars all around. The battery will work longer than you!.........Intro: Iam a Blackberry fan and was currently using a BlackBerry 9970 before switching to the passport. Prior to that I jumped ship for a couple of years and have owned the iPhone 4 and galaxy s3. When I first switched from the bold to the iPhone I finally understood why people liked the big screens. It almost seemed like the Web was designed for touchscreens. I stuck with the iPhone not only for the Web experience but because everytime I pulled out my phone I felt like part of the crowd. I guess when you go out,the cool thing is to lay your phone on the table. It felt good for once being like everyone else. But eventually I got tired of the feeling and realised I need at least a ""back"" button. Then comes the samsung galaxy s3. I loved this phone. It was slimmer and bigger than the iPhone. The Web experience was better the apps were great and the resolution was there. The only bad part was the phone itself! The auto correct was terrible and every time I enteredAn area code it would turn into 18 different numbers. Every text needed correction and it was frustrating. This brought me back to my simple little bold that turned into a true work horse into today's tech era. Surprised how such a small phone that seemed like a jpeg in today's 4k era outperformed the more tech advanced world. I seemed to give blackberry the respect it deserved. I know that my emails,text,calls are the best features of owning a blackberry. Minus the apps, blackberry's just seem to live on.First impression:This thing is huge. Try holding a cd cover and realize that that will be your phone for the year. The keys are harder to press. You hear the click for confirmation. The three row keyboard is a new thing for traditional BlackBerry users. You get use to it after a while and realize the ergonomic lay out of the digital keys. Blackberry really thought out this phone. My only gripe is there's no BACK button. I'm trying to switch that button between the volume to the back button but I don't think it's possible. It would be more convenient instead of a voice command on a phone with a keyboard for shortcuts. The screen is awesome and does make a difference for reading. Websites and reading is a big plus and I can't stress that enough. However, this is still a blackberry. The camera still lags but does have the blackberry face feature but that is even a lag. It has to wait to see a face and then ask you the option, by that time my son is all the way across the room. Apps are still limited and I only need a few. Everyone's on groupme in my circle and I still have to find a way to download it. The size of the phone will grab some serious attention so be prepared for that.Conclusion: Blackberry's work wide slogan is no joke. This phone is a work horse that makes you not want to use your laptop. Android/ios users might argue ""just turn your phone landscape "", well that's not the case when 99% of your screen is taken up with a text box. I believe blackberry nailed it with this phone. They definitely thought out of the box and made something that is efficient. A lot of people have moved on from blackberry and it's understandable. I don't blame them. But just realised that BlackBerry has presented a phone that is today's milestone for a productive mobile device.What I use this phone for: email,text,blogging,calling",2015年5月11日 在美国审核

"Very Fast, high quality, just too wide and not fluid enough.","This Blackberry has to be the best blackberry I have ever held in quality and pure head turner. However the Passport Silver Edition qualities does not make up for the lack of ease of use and apps that are just not well implemented for the BB OS. One of the major issues I had was that within the apps you cannot swipe left or right through the screens or go back without touching the screen arrow back . The optical sensor keyboard does not allow this feature. Additionally some BB apps and even the Amazon App lack a back arrow, thus causing you to start a new search once selecting an item vs just swiping back. Without a side loaded app you are unable to change fonts links you could in old BB's only size. I miss these features. The battery was not that great in the end like many reviews touted. Most of the apps wanted all permissions and location information. Like most smartphones you have to go in and edit all this otherwise the BB Passport battery will drain in 16 hrs with medium use. I did not like the overall internet browser and would say that I would not be able to use this like an iPhone 6plus or Samsung Edge 6s. The phone is well made and the metal is what makes this a well made beautiful phone. For me however, this is just not enough to spend $500 or even $300 on a used one for. Just too wide to hold and hand fatigue sets in when just surphing around. The keyboard is good but not great. That's just my opinion and preference. Three stars for this device in Oct 2015. If this was around I 2013, maybe 4 stars for build quality, however this blackberry is just too far gone to compete with speed and ease of use with other competitors implementations of apps and ease of use. One final comment is that dialing numbers and speed dialing with assigned keyboard letters is no longer available on the phone as well. That used to be a nice feature to hard press a physical key on the keyboard and it dial the contact assigned. Hope this helps before you dive in at the unlocked price. I returned mine as well.",2015年10月21日 在美国审核

I am not ‘fan’ but never had a reason to switch phones or bring my own phone along with a BB to business trips.

My guess is that Passport is a natural transition for users like me who need just one device.I don’t use my mobile device for a lot of social media activities so I can’t rate the phone for the apps.

"Good phone, but not Perfect by far.","The device is amazing built quality but after 3 days with it, I learned quiet a bit about. It works well but you have to go through extra steps to get some applications working, and in all reality some apps you may be used to will just not be available or will not work properly even after side loading them. The biggest draw back for me was to get this phone off contract to use with my plan, but as Blackberry uses a more compressed data file you will basically need a new contract or plan where in my case it defeats the purpose of buying an off-contract phone if I will need a new plan that costs more money and is worse then my current one. The phone overall is great and the key board is great, it is fast, the camera is great, and you get used to the BB 10 quickly.Summarize :Pros:Great battery lifeScreen is beautifulPremium FeelMuch better interfaceFast phone with good appsAmazon app storeCons:Will not work with your current Data plan if it is Android or iOSSome applications will not be same or work at allOverall great phone with much potential but slightly limited by a few apps and the Data plan you may be able to get for it may not be the best even with the compressed data.Therefore 3/5 rating for me, it was a deal breaker and I sold the phone quikly.",2014年11月13日 在美国审核

"Really wanted to like it, disappointed by app ecoystem","I really wanted to like this device. As a formed blackberry enthusiast, having migrated from a bold 9900 a year ago to an iPhone 5c, I have become fed up with tapping on screens, the error rate and lousy text prediction that come with iPhones. I was really looking forward to getting back to aphone with a tactile keyboard and being able to kick out emails pronto like the good ol' days! The new app selection via amazon + the opportunity to sideload apps made me think it was prime time to try BB again.The keyboard is okay, not as great as my bold 9900 was (granted I haven't given it the 2 week running in period that everyone recommends). The main problem is the app ecosystem. I use fitness apps like wahoo fitness that links to my rflkt device on my road bike (basically a garmin-like device that connects via bluetooth to my iPhone - also works on android). i really hoped I'd be able to side-load the wahoo app or patch it using the methods on the various crackberry forums. No joy (the app is locked to the google play ecosystem). I tried the patches to make it non-reliant on google maps. Nothing worked. I kind of realized that still (in 2014), if you want to make this BB device work for particular niche apps, you are going to have to invest a lot of time and effort with trial and error in sideloading and patching, and despite the ++ hours, it may not always work.I really don't want to have multiple devices (e.g. one for work and one for sports), so decided to return it.The screen is amazing. The keyboard, like I said slightly disappointing. It is wide, but not too wide - it would fit in my trouser pockets no problem. If I were purely into work and only wanted facebook and twitter outside of that, then this would be the phone for me. Sadly, being more diverse, this doesn't quite do it for me (much to my disappointment).Blackberry - if you ever get full integration with google app store I will give you guys a try again. Until then, I will (unhappily) be tapping away on my glass screen, remembering my BB9900 days.",2014年10月17日 在美国审核

I'm a college student and frequently record lectures it took passport 1.5 hrs of recording to drain 30% of my battery this have never happened with my android device. with 4 classes per day this device is simply sueles.keabord does not work as advertised, dont get me wrong typing is super fast but everything else just like the gestures to delete words swipe down for numeric keys is simply unresponsive worst than 1st generation of touchscreens. work needs to be done here.the screen is nice reads nice has nice resolution but the responsivenes leaves much to be desired many times i would swipe one direction just to repeat the motion in order for device to recognize it.My last point i want to mention is that even though i knew the selection of apps would be limited i would never suspect the developer community to be this bad on this platform if one visits Blackberry World all you can see is people complaining how developers deceived them and stole their money becuase the app would be either mis advertised, or no refound would be issued etc, etc.In conclusion ill be shipping this device back to amazon and I STRONGLY RECOMEND ANY FUTURE PERSON CONSIDERING BUYING THIS DEVICE TO THINK TWICE.

If we can take our minds off the patterns we have embraced and be focused, real people; we'll come to see that there's really not an OS or device that gives you honest and sweet control to do what you deserve in a modern day when you shouldn't be restricted by a company's fear to fix security issues; blocking their users and dictating what they do with their devices; after they spend a fortune on the bending facade!!! How sick; I don't mean to also sound bias; but some of these iThings are overpriced and don't do s*** if you don't go scouting around the appstore.

Dat fone has transformed da cell-smartphone space 4eva!!!I watched da White, da Red versions come out wiv smiles, as bof were all about da colors &amp; no additional substance!I'm glad I waited! Wen I first saw da pix of da BBP SE on Amazon, my heart skipped a double. Dis is wat da original BBP shoulda been. Dis substantial upgrade is however highly appreciated.Da Amazon page indicated that it ships in 3-5 weeks, so I jumped on da shop blackberry page, only to discover an amazing accessories promo worth over $130. I ordered right away. Da accessory promo was supposed to last till Aug.25 or so, bur by da time I checked on August 12/13, it was already over. Thank God I didn't blink.Of cos da BB hub &amp; assistant remains distinctive. Da Blend is mad nice, as u can carry your office along wiv u. Da Amazon android store complements da BBW beautifully! Da keys ve touch control etc etc. U must know dis already!Back 2 now wiv da best color - silver on a BB fone!Wivout a doubt, this is the most industrially sculpted looking fone I ve eva had in my palms &amp; da upgrades do not end there. Dis industrial look is both rugged &amp; premium @da same time!But da upgrade doesn't end dere. Da BB keys as usual are 2nd 2None, bur in dis case r even easier to use. Da keys depress more effortlessly wen compared with the previous BBP editions.Da diamond shape of da back, 2geda wiv it being dotted all over makes holding this phone in a grip, so much more better.Da camera, yes remains da same, bur now comes round shaped wiv beta protection for da lens. Dis is the same for the front facing camera. Da rear camera actually is classic, in dat it reminds one of dose way back cameras of yore!Da speaker grille has been transformed, making it sound even beta. Dis is da best sound I ve heard come out of a smartphone!Dis version allows beta typing as da space beneath da keys has increased.I could go on, bur let me let u find da rest out 4 yaself!What's da BlackBerry Venice gon b like?

the only drawback is that I doubt anyone will sell a battery case for this and that it SOLDOUT - huzzah!!!,"While Amazon raised the price by $100 on 10/25/14, there is hope that this will be affordable once the hype dies down:""As for the subsidized variant of the BlackBerry Passport in the U.S., AT&amp;T is expected to offer such an option soon, but no exact date is available at this point. The BlackBerry Passport will be an AT&amp;T exclusive in the U.S. and some reports indicated that it may cost $249.99 or $299.99 on-contract when it debuts, but it remains unconfirmed at this point.Interested buyers in Canada, meanwhile, can now get the Telus BlackBerry Passport for $199.99 until Oct. 30""_____FYI - no Firechat app in the Amazon android store which with satellites in the sky would unleash communications from costly carrier charges but right now is used in the HK protests where COINCIDENTALLY the French guy behind Firechat just happens to be in town and available to talk to reporters such as Ramy Inocencio.COINCIDENCE!______White is coming out in November.Still no word if Verizon will carry this but possibly VOLTE and the federal order that all phones be unlocked might mean that eventually you can use the Passport on Verizon.We are holding off on using our precious upgrade in the event that it does show up on Verizon by year's end so the money is not being spent on the Iphone 6 Plus, nor on the Galaxy Note 4 (absolutely delighted to be offered this alternative to android) and not spending on the GoPro Hero4 with lcd screen at last.So ... we wait.Unlike the other removable memory smartphones, this one actually makes it less of a chore to do so. That to me is so important and maybe that is why the battery is double strength - because a battery case would negate the ease of use of the memory change-out - almost as easy to swap out as a standard digital camera.I think it's important for someone - may as well be Canada Inc. - to have their own operating system. I absolutely like that the too vast and difficult to navigate android apps are restricted and re-presented in the Amazon android app store. We've never shopped our hearts out in the itunes stores' apps. We just can't afford to test drive all those beautiful promises made in the product descriptions.I know that a 4 inch is too small for me to read so that wide Passport feels like custom tailored to me. And we all know fans have no problem hauling around ipads so the size complaints may not be that honest nor fair.Even though black is beautiful, I may get what will probably age into grottiness white because it is easier to see and will be future proofing against an awesome backlit keyboard that might not last._____According to unboxing videos, Europe is getting a free screen protector and back cover protector which a comment on this review claims is for media only but I thought journalists were supposed to return review items.Anyway, there is also a white back protector for sale on the Bb website.a stainless steel frame vs iphone aluminum and samsung pleather---The microSD card slot can support up to 128GB of expandable memory---double strength 3400 amph battery is important because it is unlikely that third parties will bother to make accessories for this phone---it will absolutely fit my cloth wallet which holds my expired passport which means I will be using inexpensive travel wallets instead of cell phone cases.---I dont play games so I don't care about the apps but Amazon android apps feel like a more protected cleaner collection.---their design video is actually interesting and not opaque like apple's---""swiping a finger quickly leftwards along the keys deletes the previous word, while sliding a thumb along them more slowly moves the cursor in the same direction"""" a swipe from the right pulls up your messaging hub, while a swipe up minimizes the app you're in to get you back to the home screen.""---$600 is way too much nevermind for a non-64 bit phone with very few usable apps even though I wouldn't use many apps anyway.In 2 months, Blackberry will launch the smaller Classic.I would be happier if it lets me use it as a phone without a data contract or allowed wifi calling.---I would get a $10 minisuite strap for the back of this.Ipad users have no problem with the even larger width of that device so I feel the critics about the teapot measurements aren't necessarily fair and honest.I think this is beautiful and reminds me of Bruce Wayne so I'm pretty excited but I want to see if Verizon will carry it or if it goes on sale for Xmas since it costs more than a laptop.If smartphone companies gave us phones for one hundred dollars and wifi calling was free, everyone would have a smartphone.Xiaomi seems to be succeeding in Indonesia and India is making their own powerful cell phones but when the majority of Americans are not rich, we are stuck with LUXURY level smartphones and the pricing and carrying costs of the rich.ETA:Passport sellouts at 200,000 preorders reveal a more modest BlackBerryJared Newman@onejarednewman Sep 26, 2014 8:03 AMe-mailprintBlackBerry is doing a victory dance over the launch of its BlackBerry Passport phone, despite having filled just 200,000 orders since Wednesday.CEO John Chen revealed the early sales figures during an earnings call. The phone is now sold out at BlackBerry's website and at Amazon, where the Passport has become the top-selling unlocked smartphone.Why it matters: 200,000 orders is nothing compared to other high-end handsets such as the iPhone 6, which saw 10 million orders in its opening weekend. But BlackBerry is working on a smaller scale now, and focusing entirely on a niche set of enterprise users instead of the consumer market. If anything, BlackBerry's boasting shows how drastically the company has scaled back its ambitions as a hardware maker.BlackBerry talks a big gameThe BlackBerry Passport is, at the very least, different from other phones, with a square screen and a physical keyboard underneath. For features, BlackBerry says it focused on things business pros say they need, such as superior audio quality, long battery life and security. Still, the phone has received mixed reviews, with some users praising its messaging and e-mail capabilities, and others saying the keyboard is too awkward. The Passport's reliance on the Amazon Appstore for consumer-centric apps was also problematic for some reviewers, who ran into errors and bugs with the Android emulation.Further reading: BlackBerry Passport hands-on: 5 things you'll love and 4 things you'll hateKeep in mind that BlackBerry has boasted of strong sales before, even when there's little to brag about. After launching its BlackBerry Z10 in February 2013, the company said customers were buying the phone in ""in large numbers"" and pointed to sellouts at some key retail locations. In reality, the phone was a flop, and it cost BlackBerry close to $1 billion.If the BlackBerry Passport is selling out at 200,000 units, it means BlackBerry doesn't want to make the same mistake again. Instead, it's keeping expectations in check, making its enterprise-focused phones available in small batches, and celebrating tiny victories where it can.",2014年9月25日 在美国审核

BUYER BEWARE: NO SUPPORT OF THE UNDO/REDO FUNCTION (!),"[Edited on Feb. 23, 2015]I am pleased to say that the improved Passport design for the AT&amp;T network not only makes it a more beautiful handheld (although 'de gustibus disputandum est'), but more importantly ergonomically MUCH better to hold and type (a wider lip). Furthermore from my tests run at the AT&amp;T Union Sq. store in Manhattan last Sat. &amp; Sun. the camera works better as well! Therefore the ""upgrade"" of my original one start review to three full stars! What holds me back from awarding Passport five stars is still the lack of UNDO/REDO function which is essential to me due to heavy keyboard usage. Unfortunately I can't purchase it (as a second device mostly for emailing/texting) before BB implements that function. The Classic, also on display at the store, although better for one hand typing (which I prefer) has a keyboard that is too small for my hands. Therefore I am waiting for BB to implement a trivial code in Passport that will make it one of the best handhelds on the market.PASSPORT TO THE JOURNEY OF FRUSTRATIONThe lack of the UNDO/REDO function is a deal breaker for me. Period. Having typed this on Passport I only wish I could undo this...Making a mistake while replying to an email (or composing it) and not being able to undo an error (eg. after deleting by mistake a word or a sentence) is unacceptable, as this means an unnecessary hassle, waste of time/productivity and many steps to recreate that one missing word or content (eg. an important zip code that will take time to search for in another file or pdf document and re-paste).I cannot invest in a phone which will bring my productivity down to the pre-2007 level. If this has to do with some security feature of the device/system, than the security architecture of the BB OS has a major flaw. A hint: there are phones on the market that undo/redo by mere shaking them and clicking the desired correction...From the web search: ""the only undo command I know is wipe/restore.""Ha, ha. ‎""BB"" stands for me now as a ""big bloody"" joke...‎Here is the explanation folks why RIM was almost completely wiped out off the market in the not so distant past if we can still remember. It was not the evil Apple or Android who *poached* RIM's customers - it was the arrogance of RIM's management which was deaf to the pleas of its faithful and enthusiastic base‎ to implement their wishes in order to improve the user experience, delivering a better up to date device notwithstanding, making it the best communication environment, bar none. We could not wait any longer and abandoned a superior and secure emailing platform with a physical keyboard that we preferred to virtual keys.This beautiful device is up to date on specks, although was unnecessarily crippled IMHO with only a 3 line keyboard‎, but I would take it as is if not the drawbacks of the UI described here.The screen is gorgeous, as it is having great, and CORRECT WIDTH for a phablet. Kudos to the designers here. To be frank I would not mind it to be rectangular even if it meant a slightly longer device (a mini tablet). Instead of having just ""one screen"" as is now we would have ""two screens in one"". Even if they wanted to have the same square shape (which is not bad after all) and not diminish its size they could still round the bottom, like in other BlackBerries and place the fourth row of keys there. I don't care if such device would not be called Passport, although it still could, it's just the name, but say Pass-Partout instead or whatever. But they decided the size of the phone (and its name) to be homonymous with a travel document and strictly adhered to that concept, resorting to a virtual gimmickry in lieu of a more complete keyboard. So be it. After 3 days of using it I have made up my mind and could take it as imperfect as it is for me. However I cannot afford to subsidize their disregard for user experience and apart from monetary contribution also pay with a constant frustration this phone (or probably any BlackBerry phone) would visit on me.Please do not take it as a grievance of not getting a perfect phone, as such has obviously not been built for me yet, but of accepting by BlackBerry as a OK,a SUBSTANDARD--being the part and parcel of their operating system--i.e. the lack of the UNDO/REDO function, which is an industrial norm accepted by everybody else. I am not asking for a pie in the sky.AN IMMATURE AND BADLY IMPLEMENTED OPERATING SYSTEM IS A LEMON THAT MAKES PASSPORT TASTE BITTER - to find out whether you could live with this omission ask yourself: ""Have I shaken my phone/tablet lately?""‎I hold the affable BlackBerry CEO fully responsible for these drawbacks.By returning their product and giving them the lowest possible rating I hope that Amazon will look into this carefully and if they agree with me, they will have a talk with BlackBerry on my (and every one else's) behalf. Them having an ear of BB and forcing their hand, so to speak, in order to make the software corrections ASAP is the only way to move forward and get things done.I could be sorry for Amazon to incur a loss on this return--as I believe I should not pay a penny--but I am not sorry, because it is the negligence on part of Amazon as well, for not posting a disclaimer on their product sale page: THIS PHONE/OPERATING SYSTEM DOES NOT SUPPORT THE UNDO/REDO FUNCTION.RIM has breached my trust in the past. I was on their platform since the great little Pearl, suffered the keyboard of Bold 9700 and have been delighted right now with the quality and feel of the Passport's one. I do not trust them, nor their CEO after this most recent bad experience with the new BlackBerry 10 smartphone, hailed by most of the reviewers here as the second coming of the Messiah.Be that as it may, I shall exercise my *right of return* ;-), when I still can, and wish the rest of you to live happily ever after without that rudimentary smartphone function. I just wonder what your work around is ...Also to all of you who took such pride in the fact that with Passport in hand you stand out from the crowd I can tell you: ""You surely do!""To add insult to injury: how can you release BlackBerry Blend software that does not have Select All function coded in? Do they expect me to select every photo one by one in order to delete 500 of them (as I needed them to be placed on the SD card rather than the device memory, but removed it finally in another app)? Only ""Select"" [one image at a time] feature is available in BB Blend, not ""Select All"". I am not making this up. For this alone I should of given BB zero stars. They are bringing us right back into iPhone ca. 2007. Remember the lack of copy/paste function? At least Cupertino was capable of listening to its base.And let me be clear: I dislike Apple for sealing the battery - this is an unfortunate and unnecessary copy cat move by BB in Passport. Equally I dislike Apple's greedy approach to the flash memory issue, and for not including SD card slot in their devices. Because of that I shall NOT purchase an iPhone 6+. On the other hand I can't stand the clunkiness of Touch-Wizz extra layer in Samsung's Note phones. You get the picture, I hope, and trust me there is no hidden agenda (trolling) here.Furthermore the email composing software is buggy: while copying ‎a word or phrase and pasting it back I got a bigger font size and it stood out from the rest of the text. There's no numerical font size to remedy this bug, only a comparative one (bigger, smaller) and this did not make the pasted text equal size either (sic!). A disclaimer: I could not duplicate this problem later on, but it is there as per my early morning experience - I tried it several times with bad results.Contact manager does not have alphabetical list on a side of a screen to speed up the scrolling process, so you have to scroll‎ and scroll, especially if your list is huge. We are in 2014, sleepy dudes at BB, if you haven't noticed.There is a myriad of other imperfections (eg. the alert re deleting message from the Hub should be an option or disappear after a touch anywhere (screen/keyboard) - as it is implemented now it slows down productivity). The screens do not allow insertion of menu buttons at the bottom - it's even worse than Apple's own iOS, also imperfect because it disallows to have a continues stripe of apps down there, unless you jailbreak it ...With Passport I am beholden to BB's only method of closing an app, i.e. by swiping. Why being so Apple-like restrictive and not giving us more OPTIONS, e.g. using taps/gestures (eg. three taps on this marvelous tactile keyboard invention) to move back, close or cancel an app? Why not releasing the product with more keyboard gestures (zoom, pinch in/out, etc.)? This shows me they have rushed the product to the market to catch the 2014 holiday season.When I swipe the physical keyboard up in the middle of it (where there is two rows of keys not three, because of the space button) in order to insert a predictive text I often hit the virtual key's exclamation mark and waste time fixing it. But this can be alleviated, I guess, with a more cautious way of typing and a different ""technique"" when I swipe up in that particular spot. Again this is just one more proof to me that there should be four rows of keys - same shape, or less deep perhaps as now, but four, not three. The virtual keyboard as is now should be an option and an icing on the cake.The Cancel/Send buttons at the top of most windows (not all) make the user experience super inconvenient - you better be a hand gymnast in order to reach from the bottom of the device, from its keyboard, up to the top. Since this is a keyboard centric device these ""buttons (""Cancel"", ""Send"" words) should of been designed and placed right at the bottom of this gorgeous screen. If I can figure it out after a few hours of using it I have not much respect for the professionalism of their programmers, designers, nor of their CEO who must have NOT been using this device on everyday basis, otherwise he should of noticed such GLARING DEFECTS, IMPERFECTIONS AND OMMISSIONS.When I am inserting a bracket and subsequently a word or a phrase, tapping twice on the space bar should automatically close the bracket instead of customarily inserting of a period. The list can go on and on...The esthetics of the OS is horrific - WHY do you have an overly large blue or yellow (dep. on app) circle icons? Why are they so much bigger than icons to the right and left of it (a""Compose"" blue circle icon in the Hub, a ""Reply All"" blue circle, a ""Safety-pin"" blue icon in Compose/Forward mode or ""Safety-Pin"" icon AND ""Attach"" word below it, ""Back Arrow icon and ""Reply All"" word, and so on)? Either you have an icon and a word below or no word at all so there is the necessary and required by the rudimentary design rules (I am not a designer, btw) CONSISTENCY of your design. Besides don't you want to gain space on that screen, which is so nice to behold, with smaller circles?I consider myself to be of lower than average intelligence, and for me to be able to notice it means that people who work at BB and who did not see this must be really stupid.‎Furthermore the icons of photo images imported from iPhone to File Manager's Photo folder ‎are rotated 90deg to the left. An annoying Bug. Again - no QC on this one. Is anyone of them using this phone and testing it?Having said all that I have come to the conclusion that this whole ""eco-system"" (sorry for this horrifically sounding word as usurped by the techno-world) and the phone itself have been released to the market prematurely.The native FB client does not show emoticons (3D stickers) people sent in response to my post (I got Hub notification that people commented on my post and only saw their names without anything else. Weird...). Same stickers were visible on another platform.I have not found one single complaint re the above on internet, so either the base is complacent and gives them a pass, or it is only me who holds a defective system. By the way the device is being sent back tomorrow also for being a hardware lemon (this happens so I am not bashing BB for that, just informing), as my battery time on it is less than a day (100% at 7:55 AM, 53% at 2:00 PM, 42% at 4:20 PM, 38% at 4:44 PM, 35% at 4:55 PM, at that point I had to leave home and upon return by 7PM it was down to the red 0%). This confirms my earlier observation about the battery, which should be replaceable. A mere swap of it would solve a problem like so and save them a lot of money in the long run. My Passport was used to listen for 20 minutes to Spotify in the morning, and later in the afternoon, but mostly to handle emails and compose this diatribe, which subsequently had to be emailed to a laptop for editing, as I could not finish the job on it alone due to ... the lack of UNDO.",2014年12月23日 在美国审核

New Passport - a Disappointing Experience,"As someone who has been using Blackberrys over a decade I was excited to retire my exiting BlackBerry Bold and replace it with the new Passport. While the unit looks great on the website and the website touts it’s capabilities, I must say how disappointed I was when I received this unit and used it for --- ahh!, less than a week. I am very disheartened for the fact that Research-In-Motion/BlackBerry has missed yet another opportunity to get back in the game.The new Passport is one bulky, heavy and user UNfriendly device. The one and only feature that draws us BlackBerry fans to these devices is – the built-in keyboard. It boggles my mind how BlackBerry product team keeps on screwing up with that key differentiator. The new Passport is no exception to this disastrous implementation of the “new” keyboard. Here are the top three issues that I faced before returning the unit: 1) You needs both hands to type anything on this device due to it’s size especially it’s width. No way it fits into any regular size pocket (in your jeans/pants etc.). You will ruin your jacket’s pocket if you keep the device in it for a longer period as it is too heavy. 2) The keyboard orientation is such that one will have really hard time to bend one’s thumbs to type longer messages. 3) The User Interface has left much to be desired. I am not sure if BlackBerry got rid if it’s initial designers and started fresh because it seems that they ended up throwing “baby with the bath water”.I hear that the company may be coming up with the new Bold early next year. Amongst all the smartphone choices in the market place I am usually made fun of using this archaic device. However I will continue to use my BB Bold and will wait with baited breath for the new enhanced Bold until then hoping they will not messes up the third time.--- A BlackBerry user/fan.",2014年10月26日 在美国审核

Best to stay away... (Updated),"I purchased a Blackberry Passport out of Singapore last week during a business trip from Bangkok.It worked fabulously for the first couple of days; I really loved it.I loved the form factor, tactile typing and the sturdiness.Unfortunately, the unit's sensors (light and proximity) have all failed.I am unable to type due to no backlighting of the keyboard.A fatal flaw for a Blackberry.I've tried all of the known remedies (restarting/wiping/retesting) as outlined on the Blackberry forums.Unfortunately, they too, do not work.After calling the service center in Singapore, I am now resigned to Fedex'ing it back to Singapore, at my own expense, less than one (1) week after buying it.I have to say I am extremely disappointed with the product quality especially after giving Blackberry a 2nd chance to earn my business.Given all the positive initial notice and interest the Passport received from my corporate colleagues I cannot now recommend the Passport given the failure and hassle to get it fixed.It's a real shame as I really liked it.I'll go back to my iPhone in the interim.Hopefully, it will come back fixed and in proper working order.Update 12/15:The phone was replaced by Blackberry in Singapore, though it did cost me S&amp;H charges as well as my time.The process wasn't easy but they did do the right thing in the end.I enjoy using the Blackberry Passport more than my iPhone 6 despite having some app constraints but due to the initial product quality and the customer service hassles/aggravations I can only give it 3-stars.You potententially take that risk with Blackberry.That said I would buy it again.",2014年11月24日 在美国审核

"Excellent clavier, pour peu qu'on aime les boutons","Appareil performant, mais un peu daté à l'heure d'aujourd'hui. (Acheté en 2017, conçu en 2014.) Très beau et très classe. Très solide aussi. J'ai lâché l'appareil deux fois sur du carrelage, par accident, et l'appareil ne s'est pas brisé. (Je n'essaierai pas une troisième fois...) Très pratique au plan ergonomique, mais il faut tout faire à deux mains. Excellent clavier, pour peu qu'on aime les boutons. Il faut quand même un peu de temps pour s'adapter. Le clavier fonctionne comme un trackpad. Pratique. On peut également faire plein de raccourcis grace au clavier. Excellente batterie, pour peu qu'on se contente des logiciels natifs Blackberry offerts avec l'appareil (OS BB10) ou téléchargés sur le Blackberry Store. Les logiciels Google ou Android consomment plus de batterie. Le Hub, où sont regroupés tous les messages, est super. Bon appareil photo. La mise au point est un peu lente, mais les photos n'ont rien de honteuses par rapport à un iPhone 6. Malheureusement, l'OS BB10 n'est plus mis à jour. Problème pour ceux qui veulent le nec plus ultra. Certains logiciels sont un tout petit peu datés. Ça dépend des gouts. Jusqu'à présent, j'ai trouvé l'appareil tout à fait satisfaisant, même au plan des logiciels. (Les logiciels natifs sont tous très bien. Il est étrange que Blackberry ait décidé d'abandonner cet OS, qui est si performant et si intéressant.) Le nombre d'apps est quand même considérablement plus réduit que pour les iPhones ou les téléphones 100% Android, mais pour une utilisation normale, aucun problème. Le format carré est commode pour les courriels, Windows word ou Internet. Il déplaira peut-être à ceux qui veulent regarder des films ou jouer. Blackberry Link et Blackberry Desktop manager, qu'on utilise pour raccorder le Passport avec l'ordinateur, sont difficiles à installer avec macOS Sierra. Ces logiciels ne sont plus mis à jour. J'en conclus que l'appareil est excellent pour un appareil de 2014 (je ne comprends pas pourquoi les spécialistes tech n'en ont pas plus parlé à la sa sortie... j'ai une petite idée, mais passons... ni pourquoi Blackberry n'a pas fait plus de pub...), mais un peu juste pour 2017, à moins d'aimer les appareils hors normes, ou de vouloir utiliser un OS qui ne soit ni Apple, ni Android.",2017年7月19日 在加拿大审核

complicate history,"Not that easy.let me put you in context; I am a senior iPhone programmer &amp; senior programmer for more than 18 years of experiences. I consider myself as above average technical. And this is my long review of the Passport.First, it's an awesome devices. Design is superb, excellent finition, feel sturdy and solid, it's a professional smartphone.Hardware is also very good for a 2014 phone; 3gm of ram, external sd card up to 128gb. Keyboard with touch sensitive scrolls / actions is nice too.Batteries last for about 72h with moderate usage; which is very very good in my book too.We love the top LED that flash the color you want for the notifications type you want (sms, email, etc)Software too have some very nice ideas : multitasking is very natural with the swipe up gesture to go back to your homepage (I also have tendency to swipe up on iphone but no!). The Hub is interesting too where you see all your notifications, very similar to the iOS notification drop down panel.On a 5@7 or during a diner, put the Passport on the table and you'll get zillions of comments like : what is that ? what are you doing with this ? Are you back from the past ? Do you need love, are you all right ? You know, that kind of comments... :)Where it is a bit harder to live with are:- not even software design during the experience: sometimes the back button is bottom left, sometimes it is top right, etc- not much available free applications; for facebook messenger, I've paid 3$ for an app that works. I mean, there is alternative solutions but be prepare to have some trade off, which I can live with that.- keyboard takes time and times and even more times to be familiar with. We've all been use to type on a virtual screen keyboard, going back to a physical one take times so give yourself time in the transition experience...- steal proof; nobody want to steal that thing out of your hands be worry free- bluetooth connection/ layer seems faster than on my iphone 7+; the passport is super fast to reconnect to known bluetooth device which is niceWhy did I bought that ? Well, after installing the ios app Moment, I've observed that I was spending *too* many times on iphone. I mean, it's sooo addictive and so crazy nice that it came to a point where it doesn't make any reasonable sense. 4h / day on a cellphone is a lot in my book. It's way too much.Sure I could have remove apps from the IOS device but temptations are too strong; games, social, pinterests and instagram, oh temptations...Also, note that the passport have an android emulator that can runs android content. So it means that if you can find the app on the amazon app store, you can potentially run it on your Passport.Go to the grocery, or on the sidewalk of a populated street, or in a park and observe. Everybody's on their smartphone. I was and still am one of those folks. I've witness someone almost been killed by a van while doing whatever on her smartphone and not looking while crossing the streets.Grocery waiting line everybody's hooked, in fact, at the moment you wait for something, we / I have the reflex to reach out for the smartphone and scroll / navigate / chat / whatever.Try going to the bathroom / restroom without your smartphone just for fun. With the Pasasport, there is soo nothing curious to check on that you will be wondering why did you bring it with you at the cabines. :) Well, enough said... if that device would have come 4 years before, it could have been a winner on the market causes ideas were there, not just the level of refinement that we are experiencing on our everyday's life today.What software works for me :- Spotify from amazon app store; works like a charm but the not vertical wide screen give me a compact interface which is a medium experience.- Face10 for facebook- Messenger 10 for facebook messenger (with notifications in the hub)- iGrann for instagram- HG10 for hangout chatIts a good device for :- a person that want a physical keyboard for SMS only messaging- a person who want to be 'disconnected' from the social networks like snapchat, instagram, google play, etc...- you don't play game- battery autonomy is important in a business context- relative security of the device (even if I do thing that apple have very secure and robust device + os too)Its a ""ain't that sure"" device for:- you like mobile gaming (but last time i've tried Hay Day it was working yay!)- you are more social app user than an ant on a rainy day- you like to do everything with your mobile (controlling lights, doorways, special apps, carrier apps, apps apps apps)",2017年8月2日 在加拿大审核

Good hardware. Software still needs polishing - updated Sep 16,"Previously all my devices have been Apple - aside from a Samsung S4 to replace my last iPhone (stolen) - and without question, this is the best phone I have ever owned. Battery life is incredible - the 25+ hr. advertised usage is no joke. I sometimes go 2 days before I need to charge it. The operating system is fantastic too - plenty of great, unique features that help you do more in less time. More and more apps are available every day with Android compatibility too (which is too bad I will admit, I wish it was iOS compatible, because I hated my S4 and all it's various bugs / pointless features). On a subjective note, the device feels and looks great - very high quality construction as opposed to some of the older generation BB'sIf you spend the majority of your time texting, emailing, and reading on your phone, this is the device for you. If Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, etc. are your thing than yes, maybe an iPhone is for you. Personally, I don't like Android and would never recommendA final note worth adding: the Passport has better resolution than the current iPhone 6's, which I found surprising. However, the value of this for some is moot in a lot of respects given the dimensions of the screen. The dimensions are suited to reading and composing, which it facilitates incredibly wellUpdate -- the metal logo on the back has begun to oxidize severely. Mostly rust and one piece has fallen out already. Perhaps this is why the BlackBerry case for this phone is so poorly constructed - it was designed to address this problem by adhering directly to the back, annoyingly.",2015年3月13日 在加拿大审核

The best BlackBerry ever made!,"This smartphone is the best ever produced by BlackBerry and it is courageous because it challenges all major trends: its keyboard is half physical, half software, and its screen is a perfect square. Screen colours are gorgeous and the email system is much better than all what Apple has ever done. It is not only faster than any other email system, it is intuitive to program and to use. Everything flows harmoniously...Then why not 5 stars? Because the BlackBerry Passport cannot take advantage from its superior design for lack of applications. BlackBerry Passport runs on the BlackBerry 10 Operating System (OS) while most BlackBerry applications were made for the BlackBerry 7 OS. As a result, there are very few applications optimized for the BlackBerry Passport. Fortunately, BlackBerry has made a deal with Amazon and offers its Appstore which contains much more than books, it offers as well a few hundreds applications. But there is a drawback these applications are not optimized for the BlackBerry 10 platform. There are Android applications. Most of them work on BlackBerry Passport, but they take time to boot and they often freeze. Even Kindle, this pure Amazon application, is not optimized for BlackBerry...In conclusion, if I wanted to be frank, neutral, objective, I would put 3 stars to the BlackBerry Passport. But its design is so strong, it is so powerful, and what it does, it does it so well, that I am forced to put 4 stars. (But do not cry on me, I will have warned you: this is not a scientific mark. It is mixed with a lot of pro-BlackBerry feelings and a sort of Apple fatigue.)",2015年3月19日 在加拿大审核

A no-brainer,"I'm glad I waited a bit longer for the HD version.Pros:- The screen is amazing. No, it's not retina but no one I've shown this to has thought it was a $150 phone. It's very crisp and readable in bright light.- The included screen protector and case are very handy. You don't even get those with $600 premium phones! Given that accessories are hard to find for this phone it saves a lot of searching. It's tense putting the protector on though because it is cut very accurately - any deviation left or right can let dirt in, then it will fall off. I was lucky enough to get it on the first try though and it's great.- The screen is responsive - my old LG I replaced this with was not very good at responding to my swipes.- It's fast. People decry the Mediatek processor but I have not yet found anything that slows it down. It is good at file operations like compressing, it runs multiple applications smoothly and doesn't hang.- The speaker is loud (and you can hear it) - very rare on a budget phone. It also has two little nubs that elevate it off the surface a bit which is a very thoughtful feature.- The camera is GREAT. 8MP with lots of modes, panorama shots, good video, etc. I've taken great vacation shots with my BLU and they all have crisp colours. The iPhone beats it still, but come on this is a $150 phone. I'm happy.- The LED is integrated into the earpiece. It doesn't show up at all until you plug it in. Very nice and clean.- The power plug is on the top of the phone. It seemed weird at first but I always have my phone plugged in in the car and this is so beneficial - it doesn't crush the cable anymore. It can sit flat and the cable is out of the way.- It's heavy, but not too heavy. I know it's there, and it feels solid, but I can hold it comfortably.- Battery life is pretty good. It can last me a full day usually unless I'm using it more heavily.- The 'fully charged in' timer in the status menu lets me know how long I need to leave it on the charger. Why doesn't anyone else do this?- Micro SD. Turn your 4GB into 68GB.- Dual SIM so I can use two providers at once. Also acts as a convenient storage slot.Cons- The power button is a bit difficult to push. I miss the physical home button on my last phone as an alternative to wake it up.- No option for more space. I would have gladly paid an extra $25 for an 8GB model.- A bit bulky. Not a fault of the phone but I didn't see any option for an equivalent phone with a smaller screen.- Flash is weak. It will not light a subject more than 3ft away. One way to get around this is to use video mode with the light on constantly, then take photos when everything is lined up.Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. The dual SIM functionality is very handy since I travel often - no need to carry a bag for the extra sim anymore - and it never gets lost.I'd easily recommend this to anyone looking for a solid Android phone who doesn't want to shell out $500-$600 or enter into a long contract.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核
i received my phone two months ago and i have to say i absolutely love it. the pink is really vibrant,"i was antsy about buying an offbrand phone, but after some thorough research i did decide on the 5.0 C HD.i received my phone two months ago and ihave to say i absolutely love it.the pink is really vibrant, but i loved it.some things weren't where i expected to find them, but that just gave me more reason to play with the phone!It is basic android, but for just phone and texting, surfing, and the occasional game, it works great.bluetooth works better on this than on my previous samsung. photos are really excellent, unless i'm photographing my baby nephew, who can move faster than the flash.was very pleasantly surprised with the photo options also.only real issues i had was it took straight talk over a month to get my data working properly since i was placed on the wrong network for my area, and there aren't alot of options for cases available for this model as compared to the others.but all is well now and would not be without it!even my kids now want one!really, really love this phone!Update:a couple things I forgot to mention...this phone is quite larger than I expected.I highly recommend cutting out a piece of cardboard to the given dimensions to determine if it may be too large for you.It took me a couple weeks to adjust.The screen is as clear as you could hope for.Really really sharp and clear picture.Phone is just heavy enough to notice that you have it but very light weight and thin.And I have since discovered that Blu makes a hybrid case for this phone (yay!), available here, that I will be getting!And the charging port is at the top instead of at the bottom like most, so it does make you feel like you have your phone upside down sometimes.The issues I've had have all been minor things and not a deal breaker for me.Basically just the difference in manufacturer.Battery life has been really good unless you play a game or surf a lot.Then it drains quickly.But it also charges much faster than I ever expected!It does come with a snug silicone case, usb &amp; wall charger, and earbuds, which my son took over and said they are the best he's ever had.Overall, very well worth the months of research I put into it.I have probably been more satisfied with this phone than any I've ever had!Update:Just got the hybrid case made by Blu and I must say it is well worth the money!It fits much better than the case that came with the phone!Phone is doing great after over 2 months.Not had any issues as yet.Battery life is improving also.Even with all the surfing and game time, i now only have to charge it at night.Really impressed with this phone!",2014年12月1日 在美国审核

Let's look at the nitty gritty:------- Pros -------Takes 2 sim cards, so if you're a business owner or you use a work phone that's an extra phone you don't have to carry.Add on micro SD can take up to 32Gigs. I read somewhere that it could take a 64gig but I haven't experimented with it. Writing speed to the micro SD is fair, and the phone has a built in music app that works surprisingly well.Fast - Plays games, runs everything smoothly, no freezes. I'd pair the speed to an S2 or S3, which for the price is amazing. Running multiple programs shows no freezing (with the exception of GPS, explained below).LOUD - the ringer on this is probably the loudest one I've ever owned. Seriously, it's shockingly loud. I tend to keep it on vibrate so my coworkers don't jump when I get a text.Very bright screen - If you like a nice monitor tan, this phone is for youGood camera - Works great, no lag. The resolution is good and low light shots turn out great. The flash is quite bright. I know some reviews have been displeased with the camera, but personally it does exactly what it should do. Granted, I'm not a photo snob or a professional photographer, so take this with a grain of salt.Wifi's fast - I've had issues in the past with phones staying connected to the wifi, for whatever reason. This one latches on like a remora and stays put.Runs KitKat - not bleeding edge but close to it.Comes in wonderful fruit flavors - Think 80's neon...my phone is bright yellow and it's actually pretty awesome. I've had quite a few folks ask ""what kind of phone is that?""Comes with swag - specifically, a screen protector, a case, headphones w/mic, and a charger. Free's always good.Cheap - Seriously, I could buy 4 or 5 of these for the price of 1 Nexus 6------- Cons -------No LTE - as I live in the sticks and never get LTE, this doesn't bother me. Those of you with real connections might get uptight about it.Headphones work, but won't stay put - The earpieces must have teflon in them or something because I can't get them to stick in my ears. The phone comes with 3 sizes but none seem to stay put. Again, this isn't really a big deal for me since I connect via the bluetooth in my car, but for some of you it might.GPS is broken - This is a big deal for me. I'm not sure whether it's related to the version of Android it's running (KitKat), something in the firmware or it's my phone specifically but I can't get GPS to work without bouncing out of the app I'm in. For example, Google Maps pops up, GPS comes on (and apparently works), and as soon as I search for something the app crashes. Bang! No GPS love. Sometimes it'll run for a few seconds before crashing. Additionally, I've found apps that extensively use GPS for posts (Twitter, FB, etc) will have a tendency to crash also. I've tried a few things (reinstalling apps, mucking about with the many power settings, etc) but no luck. Searching for the resolution hasn't yielded any fixes either. If you guys at BLU can figure out how to get this working for me let me know...this is really my only large issue.------- Overall -------Totally worth the money. With the exception of the GPS issue I'm quite happy with this phone. When this gets fixed I'd recommend it to anyone needing a phone and would rate it 5 stars.",2015年1月14日 在美国审核
Phone is falling apart...,"UPDATE!!! Jan 1, 2016Almost a year later, and the phone is falling apart. Bluetooth stopped working, GPS stopped working, Wi Fi not working at work at all, but used to. Works at home, though. Has trouble sending text messages sometimes. Lags really badly. No way of defaulting write new files of the cam and it always tells me ""insufficient space. free up some to take more pics"". I can't even download new apps most times because it gives me this message DESPITE the fact that my Default write disk is my 16GB SD Card!! The phone is just something that was thrown together and many features haven't been thought of thoroughly testing before putting the product out. I am looking for another phone but will use this as backup.changing my original 4/5 star to 2/5 because of this experience. But I am very grateful for all the times I used it for. And luckily, it hasn't failed on me up until this point. BLU just needs to work a lot harder to think of all the bugs and limitations they leave out when putting their product out on the market.May 31, 2015Great phone with great features. I love everything about it. From HD screen, to fast responsiveness. Unfortunately, like some people have been saying it has WiFi issues. For me, these issues aren't as extreme as for others. For example, when I am at home, I almost never have any problems. But when I am at work, Wi-Fi gets buggy. I have to disable &gt; enable. And even then, it would go down 2 seconds later. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. But it's not a big deal to me. I don't surf the web much, plus I get e-mails through cellular provider anyway.I bought this phone to mess around with and eventually root it to practice on. Would've given it 5 stars, if it wasn't for the Wi-Fi bug.As other people have said, BLU has great potential, and could eventually be a great electronics company within a few years. But they have to work hard on fixing bugs and improving their hardware first.",2015年6月1日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price.,"I am really happy I bought thus phone.it performs very fast and does all I need it to do. I was able to buy a service that is very affordable.it is super easy to switch from cell data to wifi to save my 4g data.It is not loaded with extra software that I would never use unlike my wifes Samsung Galaxy S4.though it is a fraction of the samsung cost, it seems to perform as well with the exception of slower camera and smaller battery.Battery life is pretty short compared to my other devices so I compensate by using a retractable cable and 2600 mah battery pack.I also keep a cable and usb charger in both cars.Blu updated the os so it works even better.Update 7/9/2015In the months I have used this phone it has performed very well with the exception of the very short battery life.If I know I'm going to be out for awhile, I bring battery backups.I have several 2500mah battery backups that easily fit in my pocket and with those I won't be out of juice even if I am running wifi and battery intensive aps.I have not needed it but for fear of a dead Blu, I even have a 13,000MAH battery backup.It does not fit easily in a pocket.The camera is slower than I am used to but it still takes some decent photos.The wifi is as good as my blackberry or my wife's Galaxy S4.For instance I am able to connect to our local Sears wifi in the middle of their parking lot.I dislike programs I am not using to be burning battery power so I use a battery saving app that kills apps I don't use.I'm really happy with my Blu phone and would buy another if I needed a new one.Update January 26, 2018This phone is still working just like it did the first day.Screen is still bright clear and responsive.After three years of use, the weak points are battery life and memory.I find that android works better with 2 or more gb of ram.I did end up getting a new Blu R1 and like it even more.",2015年2月17日 在美国审核
Great first phone or as a backup.,"First let me say that this is an excellent choice. I got this for my daughter and she loves it. I will not go a lot into the technical details of the phone as others have already done that. I will mention a couple of things that I find significant. First is the stock android install. There is little to no customization to this build. So if you are looking for a stock experience then this will be for you. The internal memory is small and you will more than likely need an SD card. What surprised me was the ease of moving most programs to the SD card, this can be done from APPs menu in settings menu. The other thing that was a nice surprise is the camera app automatically switched to saving to the SD card. I did not have configure that.So far build quality is good. The TPU case that comes with this is a nice addition. Without it the phone is very slippery. It is pretty large. Even thought the screen is the same dimensions as my Nexus 5 the phone is physically larger both taller and a little wider. Also has some heft to it compared to the N5.Camera performance for the price of the phone is excellent. Like I said before I got this for my daughter and the camera gets used a lot. Low light is not very good, but the speed of the shutter is better than the stock camera on my N5. I was able to mess around with the settings and get some good shots with it even in poor light. Front camera works for video calls and selfies.Overall phone is tough to beat for the price. It's better than a motoE and performance wise is really close to the motoG.",2015年1月22日 在美国审核
With a great price comes terrible downfalls.,"Bought this phone for my wife. I read a bunch of reviews and watched youtube reviews.Pros:- Cheap- Comes with a case/screen protector- Decently fast (not playing games)Cons:- Screen feels cheap/plastic-y- Screen is finicky/touchy (Sometimes when you click something it doesnt register, its only mildly annoying)- Battery Life is ABYSMALMy wife wanted a Samsung Galaxy S 3/4 and after researching I figured this is abut comparable to a S3 which is around the 200 mark used it seems, and most are locked. I knew it wasnt a perfect replacement or anything but I figured for what she wanted it for it would work (basic Websurfing and texting). I knew about the lack of 4G and wasnt bothered since we dont have the greatest 4G coverage here anyway. Bought the phone and a Straight Talk Tmobile Sim. Did overnight shipping, since we needed the phone quick. Setup the phone no problem Speed tests showed decent speed. Phone overall seemed a great buy.First day we take the phone out, no problems with reception. Phone is at a full charge at 10 am when we left the house. Wife doesnt use the phone at all until noon and on for about 30 mins before a 2 meeting. After the meeting we're headed home and she was browsing reddit and the p[hone is already dead. I turn on all the power saving options and put on a battery saver app, that also monitors charge levels.The phone seriously goes down about a percentage every 2 mins the phone is being used. I figured maybe I just have a bad battery so I contacted Blu, they responded by pretty much saying ""You bought it within the last 30 days from Amazon its their problem contact them"".If your planning on getting this phone be aware the battery life is beyond terrible and to grab a portable charger or 2nd battery because it will probably die within an hour of web browsing.I would rate their customer service lower than Comcast and thats saying something.",2015年1月13日 在美国审核
Great Phone,"If I could give this 4 1/2 stars I would, as only reason this didn't get 5 is the phone volume (even speaker) which could louder. This is a starter smartphone for me as don't have one currently. I didn't want to spend a lot for a phone that I may not like, so thought this was really good value, &amp; had good reviews.The dual SIM was a big selling point for traveling, along with being unlocked.It uses regular size SIMS, but if you had a mini or micro, could use a SIM adapter.I got the blue one, &amp; love the color, along with the blue case that came with it.Screen protector that came with it wasn't good, couldn't get the bubbles out at all, so had an extra thick tablet one, cut it down to fit &amp; that works great.It is a fingerprint magnet without a protector.Battery life was fine, charge once a day at most if you use heavily otherwise in standby will last a few days.I got a 32GB card to extend the memory &amp; moved some of my games to it to save phone storage (yes you can do it on this version of Android).It seemed bigger than I imagined, even though I had the dimensions, &amp; was torn on whether I wanted a smaller device, but makes sense to be bigger for ease of games etc, &amp; now I'm used to it, I actually love it.I did a lot of research on phones to see which one would work best for me since I'm a newbie to the smartphone world, &amp; I'm really grateful to the other reviews which helped me choose this. I'm glad I picked it &amp; have no regrets so far.",2015年1月27日 在美国审核
Great back up and travelling phone.,"Got it on Black Friday with exceptional price of $109.99 and absolutely love it.This is a big competitor against Moto G.* What I like:+ The design. It doesn't look like around $100 phone at all. Flat back for typing without pumping.+ Smooth interface. No hiccup, some regular multitasking had been done fine.+ Camera. Better than I expected. Better than Moto G 1st gen. (not sure about 2nd gen)+ Speaker. quite loud for rear facing, fairly clear.+ Accessories come along.+ Price. A beast!+ Dual Sim. Will be good for travelling which I'm about to do.+ US company ^_^* What I don't like:- Buttons. They put them too high, should have leave them around middle of the phone. Good thing is that the power button not on top.- Brightness and volume adjustment. Too bright and too loud for minimum. I had to use Screen Dimmer app and deal with volume myself.- Call volume. This one is not loud enough.- No guarantee update. Didn't know about this before buying the phone. I think this is why it's cheap. If you feel like you're a Lollipop lover, don't go for this ;)*Like + don't like:+- Battery. Great when standby and/or listen to music. Not so good when the screen is on (I would blame for the over bright display).*Conclusion: Great as a backup phone or starter phone. I dropped and broke my precious flagship killer Oneplus One.

Nice entry to mid-level phones,"I bought a couple of these for my cousins back home. I'm not normally a fan of pink, but I will admit, these pink phones look pretty nice. They are a nice vibrant shade and even the OS is themed pink. I only played around with the phone a little bit to test it out and make sure everything works before I give it to them, but from what I see, it's a nice snappy entry to mid-level phone.The display looks nice and vibrant and nice clarity when I streamed a movie on it. I took a few sample shots with the camera and it's mediocre, what I would expect from a camera in this category level I guess. It's acceptable, but not something that makes me go ""wow"" when I see the picture, some of the sample pics I took had a lot of noise in them. But, the pics I took were all indoor pictures and not outdoor, so the picture quality could possibly be much better under proper lighting conditions.I really do like the fact it's a dual sim phone and I wish my daily phone was a dual sim phone. There is also a slot for a micro sd card up to 32gb, which is a must-have for any phone I own (and gift). Another plus is that these phones come with a screen protector and a case included in the box. Normally these would have to be purchased seperately. Way to go Blu!Side note:One of the two phones I ordered was defective (randomly kept powering itself off...) and Amazon promptly replaced it, thanks amazon! :)From what I've seen so far, these are pretty nice phones to look at and to use, especially for the price. I think my cousins will be very happy with them. :)If anything happens with the phones will it's in their possession (other than dropping it), I'll be sure to update the review at that time.",2014年12月3日 在美国审核
Great Product and arrived 2 days before expected delivery date,"Love this phone all around but there is 2 things I am picky about on this.1) Battery will drain really fast and does not last long at all.2) Heat, This thing gets really hot were the camera is located and above the battery were I bet you the CPU is. So watching videos can be a pain because this gets hot, not warm, I mean HOT!!!I picked up a external battery pack to carry on me when I go fishing.PROS:Sound on this thing is amazing, I am so glad I got this, I can listen to music when fishing and hear the thing all the way across the Harbor Pier while its only 25% turn up. That right there beats my Galaxy S3 hands down.Has 4 cores over my old dual core and man do i love it, its fast but bad part is that uses more battery now, and remember what I said about battery being bad. (Tip: Get external battery pack)I have big hands, so a big phone is a must have for me.Other Thoughts:I would really love to see them make better batteries for this, its a bigger phone and its bigger then my S3 and my S3 has a 2600MAH battery and this Blu phone has a 2000MAH battery so there still needs to be some improvement here.There has got to be some extended battery packs that should be made for this phone because I would hands down be the first on the list to buy one.I know this phone gets really hot as I said above, I was expecting this though. I build computers and it was going to be obvious for me to know this but this review is for you consumers and also a better feedback for BLU Studios to improve there products. I am happy with my purchase and I am glad to support this company with buying there product.Tip: BUY A EXTERNAL BATTERY PACK IF YOU GO ON LONG TRIPS.",2014年10月2日 在美国审核
well pleased,"only had it for 2 days now, but so far very pleased. Phone seems like a quality item and everything works well. The voice clarity is exceptional. Battery life seems a little short however by reducing screen brightness to 50 percent has helped a lot. More experiments with battery saving to come. So far, a bargain.OK I've used it for 2 weeks now and continue to be very happy with it. My needs are modest but I have gotten 3 days of use from the battery (keep that brightness down and put in sleep mode when your done using). Dropped once on tile floor from about 4 ft high, no problem but was in a case. I don't know how you could ask for much more.One month update. Still very pleased. Biggest complaint is fingerprints on screen (as others have mentioned). Will be trying a new screen protector that promises to eliminate fingerprint problem. Report to follow.Second (and hopefully) final update: Solved the only two (minor) problems with this phone. Another Amazon product: ....... Cbus Wireless Matte Finish TPU Flex-Gel Silicone Case / Skin / Cover, Stylus Pen &amp; 3x Screen Protectors Guards for BLU Studio 5.0 C HD / 5.0C HD - Semi Transparent Black ..........fixed everything. The silicone case is tight fitting and makes the phone less slippery in your hand as well as adding some protection. The screen protectors included with the case appear to have completely solved the fingerprint problem without reducing touch sensitivity and screen brightness. The black transparent case mutes the white back on the phone and makes it appear less ""garish"".",2015年1月13日 在美国审核
BLU Studio 5.0 appears to be a very nice phone if internal memory isn't an issue for you.,"I ordered this phone for my daughter.I was looking for an unlocked phone that didn't cost an arm and a leg.I researched like crazy and found this one, although I'd never heard of this brand.When it arrived (on time) I was very pleasantly surprised.The blue is super cute.Very nice phone: not loaded down with apps like my Samsung S5, nice wallpapers, easy to navigate, it seemed very responsive when I played around with it, an absolutely beautiful screen, and it felt good in my hand.It came with some nice stuff: cute case that matched the blue of the phone, earphones, as well as a wall charger and manual.Nicely packaged also.I did not try out the camera, so I can't comment on that.But I was kinda worried about 2 things regarding this phone: the 4gb of internal memory (which I knew wasn't going to be enough even with an sd card) and whether it would last since I wasn't familiar with this brand.I searched for a model of this phone that had more internal memory because I was so impressed with it that I would have taken the chance on BLU, but I didn't find one.After researching some more I returned it and ordered a Motorola Moto G second generation.It has 8gb of internal memory (a little better).Seeing the BLU phone in person, I found that the positive reviews of this phone are accurate.But I am curious to see further reviews regarding how it lasts.If the internal memory wasn't an issue, I would have taken a chance on this one because you can't go wrong with this price for such a great phone.",2014年12月6日 在美国审核
nice phone,"Ok, after having bad experinces with POSH and some fake phone remade from Samsung S4, I got this one. Apparently it's not half way bad. Both SIM card slots worked, battery charged, internet was detected along with service provider right away, GPS worked inside and outside. I had to download SIm manager app to be able to personalize options with SIMs but it was pain free, so can't complain. Overall, very good looking, nicely working (slightly slower internet connection than Samsung S4, but not as bad as POSH, especially for the money), camera is 8MP as stated I think pictures are almost as good as with more expensive phones. I am very happy with this phone. Can use one phone instead of two as I have two phone numbers, one for work and one for personal use. Gave 4 stars ONLY because of the camera and battery running low. Otherwise, phone does connect to 2 mobile networks, so that maybe a reason. Not too bad though. Lasted all day without recharging, but when did not use the GPS or social media too long. Highly recommended for people who need a PHONE that would not be a burden for the budget but will serve its purpose.",2014年11月8日 在美国审核

Short-lived and terrible warranty service,"This phone seemed like a really good purchase at first.Dual-core, fast, and attractive.Unfortunately, it doesn't work for long, and BLU's warranty service is ABYSMAL.Within 6 months of purchase, the top half of the touchscreen stopped functioning intermittently, then altogether.Next the bottom half - intermittent, then dead.Shortly after, the phone refused to turn on, and even the charge light wouldn't illuminate.I contacted BLU's warranty department, and submitted the required webform (including IMEI, copy of purchase receipt, my shipping address and contact info).Two weeks later, no response, so I called their customer service number.Held for 20 minutes, gave all of this information to the representative again and was told that I would be receiving an email with return instructions.Two weeks later, no email.Called again, held for 25 minutes, gave all of the same information and was told I 'needed to send proof of purchase to get a return'.I pointed out that I had attached my Amazon receipt to my RMA request a month ago, so I was transferred to a supervisor.Repeated every detail of my phone and contact info AGAIN to the supervisor.FINALLY got the email to ship the phone back.Now we'll see how long it takes to actually get a replacement.Believe me, I won't be holding my breath.",2015年3月12日 在美国审核
Great price but 4G locked until now,"This is a decent cellphone at a great price but I have to take off one star having a woefully small internal storage of 4 GB, 16 GB and this would have been perfect and another star for not being a true 4G phone. The only option it has is 3G when you go into it's options and I have used it on both T-Mobile and AT&amp;T networks and at best only got 3G+ or 3Gh service. Perhaps overseas it operates at the frequencies needed to do 4G but the two carriers I use 4G LTE which this phone does not support. The 4G LTE phones use the micro SIM cards while this uses the older standard SIM cards that can't support 4G LTE. I use the phone all the time and it plays almost any game I throw at it. Another disadvantage I noticed is that the battery is good for 4 to 5 hours of heavy use and I have let it run with an app streaming audio over the WiFi with screen off for 6+ but you want to keep the charger handy when out on the road.Update:As of the January 11th 2015 firmware update the phone now has full 4g functionality on at least the AT&amp;T network.

Worked well for first 3 months....Now it's tossed.,"My mom got me this phone for my birthday. I received it in February and from then forward, it was a good phone. Everything was running perfect. As the months passed, it would cut on and off randomly, and my music would be gone. In May, my 16gb sd card crashed in the phone and I had just bought it. Now in June... It no longer works. Last night I went to sleep with the phone still on the charger. When I woke up, the phone was very hot. I took the case off and everything to let it cool. I tried to turn it off and it wouldn't. The screen remained black with the red light for charging still on. I had no choice but to take out the battery to turn it off. After an hour, I went to turn it on and it would start up with the beginning screen and then blink on and off the whole time. I tried charging it and switching batteries with my sister because she has the same phone. My battery works in her phone and so does my charger. After researching, it may just be the phone in general. I tried doing hard reset but that doesn't work. Now the phone isn't responding at all.Just because it overheated... that doesn't destroy your phone unless the phone already had defects. I'm not the only person who has had problems with this phone. Now I have no phone or the money to get a new one... And this isn't the greatest time for this to happen. I am very disappointed.

HAPPY!!!!,"Just a short review. Researched and researched for an unlocked phone and finally chose this one. Glad I did, really does everything a higher end phone does except, if your looking for 4g then this is not the phone for you. I live in rural area and this is not important to me, 3g works, just great, able to load all apps, great clarity when streaming video, all in all a great phone for the price. The only problem I had, this being my first experience with an unlocked phone, is as I took it to various phone carriers, for a sim card when the sim card was inserted, it did not read it, I took it to metro pc, cricket, and boost, finally I took it to a hodgepodge phone carrier, that carried all of the above, and she said this phone for some reason won't read the sim card until you actually activate the service, which was risky because now you have to pay for the sim card and the activation if it doesn't work, but she assured me it would work, she advised me to get H2O, and sure enough it WORKED just great, dumped my old cell from carrier which I was paying 65.00 and am now paying 30.00 per month with unlimited talk and text, with 500mb of web,(don't really use it all that much for this) although could have went with any plan, which offered more web data.

Nice phone,"I like this phone.It is an upgrade for me.I had a hard time getting it to work with Straight Talk.It wouldn't work until I deleted my old phone service with them.I had hoped that I could keep the same phone #, but Straight Talk assigned me a new one.I had to have someone more tech savvy than myself to program the APN settings.The owners manual that came with the phone is about useless.I am in the process of figuring out the phone myself.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is due to the battery.I have to charge the phone twice a day.I am 59 years old and not a big game player, nor do I talk for long periods of time.The other phones I had in the past I could charge once every morning.The other thing that could be better is the volume to hear who you are talking with.I wish I could have it louder, as it is like it is set on low volume.For the price this is a nice phone.Update on this phone.It completely died April 22, 2017.For the last year it was giving me problems.it seems I was constantly rebooting it.I guess I should happy it lasted for a couple of years, but I will never pay over $100. for a phone again.It just isn't worth it, especially when you have to replace them every couple of years.",2014年10月15日 在美国审核
Love It!! 👍,"Love everything about it so far! I had the Blu Studio 5.5S for about a year and wanted something different. I was thinking of trying the Blu Win to try out a Windows OS instead but the price and color choices caught my eye with this one instead, and I'm really very pleased. This phone although cheaper than the 5.5S is so much better, it runs faster, the display and resolution keeps impressing me with how much better it really is, and for a lower price! I had Walmart Family Mobile so I just transfered my SIM and SD cards and set my apps up and I was ready to go. Doing all of that drained my battery pretty fast so the battery life didn't really impress me. I'm a light phone user tho, so that shouldn't be too much of an issue. Also the connectivity is mostly 3g not 4g... With the Studio 5.5S I was getting H+ sometimes.

"Excellent unlocked, affordable phone.","It might be a mid-range smartphone in specs, but I'm giving it 5 stars because of it's excellent price-to-value ratio (also considering that it's unlocked!)...I'd give it 4.5 if Amazon did half-stars.I'd been looking for a great unlocked phone that's not insanely priced...and quickly found out that Blu was the only reasonable option. I'd never heard of them before, so it was a bit of a risk, but they seemed to be doing something exciting--attractive, decently-spec'd, low-priced, unlocked phones. And that's exactly what they're doing.I was pleasantly surprised by the nice packaging, the included flat-cable headphones and usb/charger, and rubber case (the case is just okay, adding only a tiny bit of extra protection and making the vol and home buttons a little harder to hit, but what other manufacturer includes a case and screen protector?). The included items add some excitement and uniqueness...it's a budget phone that doesn't feel, look, or come with the budget experience.Continuing with the unique/bonuses, dual-sim cards is a nice feature. I also like that the usb/charger plugs in on the top-edge, rather than the side or bottom, making it easier to handle or browse the internet while charging.It comes with a non-bloated version of KitKat. That's nice. As always (this is an Android complaint, not a Blu complaint), I'd still like to be allowed to remove a few pre-loaded apps...especially when there's not a ton of on-board storage. But at least it comes with very few forced apps.It handles Android KitKat really well, touches/swipes are registered accurately and quickly. It performs well with streaming video (Netflix, Hulu). I don't have any complaints about it's performance, or any major quirks I've experienced. (I'm not a gamer, so I can't comment there, but obviously, it's not for hardcore gamers).The screen looks great, rich colors. It's near-retina / in the retina range. The brightness/vividness dims a bit when viewed from angles (to be expected), but it's still sharp and viewable from angles.The camera is decent. I still have the plastic over the lens, which might affect picture quality a bit, but it seems good (not knockout, not replacing my 16MP camera, but good enough). Handles low-light, and it's nice to have the flash on board (for pics and for a super-bright flashlight).The internal storage is a bit skimpy at 4GB. Sure, you can add a 32GB microSD, but I have a good 29GB worth of music on mine, so I'm still pretty close to maxed out. (That made me wonder if I should've gone for the Blu Life 8, with twice the storage, and accepting up to 64GB microSD cards.) I wish the Studio 5 C HD had either 8GB on-board, or allowed for up to 64GB SDs...either would solve my storage gripes. Then again, when you feel like complaining, take a look at the price-to-feature ratio.I like what Blu's doing, clearly taking care and pride in their offerings. I'm happy with the performance and design, and more than happy to find a great unlocked phone for this price.",2014年11月7日 在美国审核
Great for the price/you get what you pay for,"For $111, this is a great phone. Huge screen, very fast and snappy response, videos look very good. The accessories included was a nice touch. Having a removable battery in 2015 waspleasant surprise, even if the case only serves to aggravate you when trying to control the volume.The atomic neon yellow is AWESOME.Now the things I did not like so much:The back feels like plastic siding off of a tiny houseThe WiFi radio sucks - speedtests show it's only getting 2.35Mbps when my other devices all get 5.75Mbps on my WiFiCall quality is meh. Speaker volume leaves much to be desired.The button configuration ... uggh ... why not put all buttons on 1 side? I can't push the volume without my grip pushing the screen button, vice versa.3G, well I didn't expect that but other 3G devices I've used in the past were a lot faster.Not even including a measley 2GB card that would have cost a few bucks, dislike.The narrow bar at the top for notifications.The sound notification.That it takes a master's degree in electronics to figure out how to turn off the hepatic feedbackAll and all, I'm glad I found this phone before I went and spent $140 on something that was the same quality.

"Limited internal storage, otherwise mostly good.","I've had it for seven months and in general it works very well. However, beware the internal storage is only 4 GB.My phone filled up storage even though it has an SD card also.I couldn't delete anything from the internal storage. I was able to move some apps to the card but not all.So it filled up internally and wouldn't work correctly and couldn't update apps.After a call to tech support at Blu, I was told how to do a hard reset to the phone.This solved the storage problem temporarily but I had to set the phone back up from scratch.Now I have some room but not as much room for as many apps as I would like to have.I see the new models have twice the internal storage as mine so you will be ok for a while.Also, the phone has started up in Factory mode 3 times which requires a reboot but you don't lose any data.Also, the screen has a few bubbles under the surface that won't come out.The surface scratches easily so stick on a good protector. Otherwise, the phone works great as an unlocked phone.Right now, I'm using it on Ting with good results, quality of calls, texts, etc.",2015年4月4日 在美国审核

Great for Basic Smartphone Use,"I've had this phone for over four months and it's been a workhorse for me. I am not a power-user, don't play games or listen to music and only need a handful of apps. If you need a phone for calls, email, kindle, etc., you really can't go wrong for the price.I would warn potential purchasers that this phone does not have a lot of memory. You can expand it with an SD card, but many apps need to remain on the phone. So if you're really into apps, you will run out of room fast. I have the usual suspects, including Skype, and I haven't run out of room. I transfer as much as possible to the card.And the speaker sounds pretty tinny. It's fine for speaker-phone and turn-by-turn navigation, but you won't want to use it for music (unless you want everything to sound VERY old school). I haven't played music with a headset, so I can't comment on the sound quality.I charge it every night, so I don't really have a problem with the battery.

Great bargain on a very good phone...,"Very, very good for the money.At first I was disappointed because when I set up the phone, it stated it was a 3G phone when Amazon website states it's a 4G phone.However, after a few days the phone requested an update, which I did, and POW!!! The phone ""matured"" to a 4G.Speaker sound is incredibly loud which is good and bad (can hear it well, but tends to be a little muffled with bass sound when it's really high).Android is Android, so you just can't go wrong with that.The only reason I'm not giving it a 5-star rating is because the battery life is mediocre.If you have a charger in the car, at home, and at work, then you have no problem because you have a way of charging, but if not, avoid playing games, movies/video, or music because it drains the battery super fast (I mean two hours of listening on a full battery, you check and it's at 40-50%).Overall, I'm happy with the phone.",2015年6月11日 在美国审核
Crap. Pure crap.,"If I could give ZERO STARS I would. I've had this phone not even a year and it is the biggest piece of s*** phone I've ever had. There have been multiple incidences where I've had to refrain from smashing it or chucking it across the room, not only because of its slow response, but because it is CONSTANTLY rebooting itself and the battery life lasts a tops of 4 hours maximum...without my even messing with it. It can literally sit in my purse for those four hours, on a good day, and go from 100% to 12%. It may as well remain on a charger. I effing hate this phone; will NEVER buy a Blu Studio phone again.

"decent device, excellent price.","All things considered (price, functionality and size), of all the (mid to low end) smart phones I've owned, this is my favorite. It seems to have most of the capabilities of an iPhone and Samsung (family members with a Samsung and iPhone), but at a fraction of the price. I've owned it for 6 months. It looks good, feels good, takes decent photos, good quality screen, fast web surfing, snappy game play, surprisingly long battery life (compared to my past phones) and good voice quality. Prior to owning this phone, I've always preferred using my iPad or desktop for surfing at home - but this is the first phone I find myself using on the couch, due to it's size and performance. Having said all that, it has one odd flaw - the battery meter is inaccurate. Although the battery life seems longer than all the other devices I've ever owned (except iPad) - one minute the meter shows 25% power and moments later it's dead (what happened to 20%, 15, 10, etc..)?",2015年11月20日 在美国审核

I'm a frequent user of Netflix and Spotify but had to uninstall Spotify because although I don't have any tracks saved, it kept telling me the memory was full.The phone has NEVER told me who's calling, I have to guess, and it's sloooooow to do even the most basic thing like switching from an app to another.

Great phone for the price and in general,"This review has taken me a while to write,first I gave this phone as a gift to my father. He is over sixty years old and has little to no tech savvy when it comes to cell phones. I wanted to get him an unlocked cellphone so he would not have to worry about the price tag or when he decides to change carriers. He absolutely loves this phone. First of all, the screen is HUGE, I have a LG G2 and it makes my screen look small. It comes in very cool colors and it is actually quite sleek. The apps and software on the phone are not to bad. So if you like having a nice cellphone, but you may not be too tech savvy this is definitely for you. Also, the phone is an amazing deal. You get a great, stylish phone, and you get a screen protector, as well as, a cell phone case. This phone is truly great. When my father went to go get a sim card and showed it to one of the employees, the employee fell in love with his phone. Honestly, I would have gotten this phone for myself if I had known it was so cool instead of paying $400 dollars on my LG.This is a most definite yes, If I could I would live to advertise this cell phone and the brand",2015年8月30日 在美国审核

Love my BLU!,"I've had my phone for a week and absolutely love it!First of all, regarding the 3G, 4G thing...If you research, 3G HSPA+, it is super fast and basically 3.5G or some would say 4G.The only thing this phone is not capable of is 4G LTE, but I think they have other models that are 4G LTE.A lot also depends on your carrier.I have T-Mobile and when I'm in a 4G area and my phone is reading, 3G H+ or HSPA+, it is lightning fast, just as fast as my old Samsung 4G was, but if you're in a 3G area (not capable of 4G), you will get standard 3G speeds.So, who cares what is says on the screen?The speeds are still equal to 4G.Next, the 5"" display and graphics are beautiful and it operates just like an iPhone.There's no need for an iPad as it's great for video and reading articles.No freeze ups on the streaming, so far.As far as the battery life, I first installed an App Killer, which seemed to actually drain the battery more.Then I discovered after reading another review that you only have to hold the home screen a few secs and then swipe the apps closed that you are using - just like an iPhone or iPad.So now after uninstalling the App Killer and doing that (which is really similar to my previous Samsung Task Manager), the battery lasts all day and into the night and I charge it a bedtime.I ordered the blue BLU (the baby blue shown), but once in its case, it becomes a beautiful teal blue color.This is a no brainer. Why spend mega bucks on a phone when you can get a BLU for less than $150??? I've shown it to friends who have iPhones and they even think it's great.One caveat, supposedly, if you're a heavy gamer, this isn't the phone for you, but the KK OS is awesome.I would love to buy stock in BLU.They should go public.Great job, BLU!Thanks!",2014年10月18日 在美国审核
"Downgraded Nexus 5. Yet,  it's a steal for the price","I have the Nexus 5 and my girlfriend bought this phone. In comparison to the Nexus 5,this is phone is actually taller. The phone is a steal for the price,hands down. But there are a ""few"" downsides to this phone....THE BAD: One bad downside in my opinion is the internal memory storage of 4GB. Keep in mind that the majority of apps,especially games,do not let you transfer the data to the micro SD storage. Also very important,not sure with other carriers but this is ONLY 3G with MetroPCS. It will not connect as claimed,4G with MetroPCS. Lastly and most important, DO NOT USE THE CHARGERUSB CABLE IT COMES WITH. Not sure about everyone else's but it barely fits. You have to force it whenever you need to connect or disconnect the USB. It is slowly damaging the USB port of your device. Buy a new one instead or use one that you previously had.I have a spare USB and it fits perfectly.THE GOOD: The screen is really HD. Nice display. The sound is crisp clean and loud. This phone is louder than my Nexus 5 which is a big plus. The processor is snappy. 1.3ghz quad core speaks for itself. The camera is great. This phone is pretty much a downgrade of the Nexus 5 for a much cheaper price tag.FINAL VERDICT: It's a steal for the price. You will not find a 5 inch screen phone with these specs anywhere. If you end up buying this phone,make sure you check that the USB charger cable it fits nicely. If you are forcing it in,dump it and find a new one.",2014年10月5日 在美国审核

I am completely satisfied and honestly,"This is my second Blu phone and I am even more impressed this time around! I use it on MetroPCS.

I never saw the point in dropping 80 percent of what my rent is on a phone, however, so I searched for an alternative. This meets the bill. There are some steps to get it up and running on Metro, at least, but this is very easiky done by either going to a Metro store (or googling how to set it up to metros network-its easy- im not patient with tech at all but even I did it) and having your sim switched to the serial number of the phone. The kitkat OS is smooth as glass, and in response to the comolaints about battery life, with ANY phone if you use it heavily (as I do) expect battery to run low- that a aid, I use mine literally all day every day at work for music(building wiring) and the only time I need a charger handy is if I plan on streaming pandora all day. I am completely satisfied and honestly, this phone has by far exceeded expectations, as did my blu studio 5.0 II. It is really a fantastic product, and also, being abke to choose the color of it is fun too :) appearance is chic and slim, actually slimmer than I expected. Comes with a hard and soft case, and as for the soft case, ill say this: I have dropped my blu studio 5.0ii countless times, and that case performs EXCEPTIONALLY. Never a single problem with screen or phone damage, because withthis phone, also with the 5.0ii, the soft case forms a tiny lip around the screen..which is literally all you need. As long as you use that soft case, or any case really, this phone WILL NOT BREAK, and I am hard on electronics. I would give it ten stars if I could!",2014年11月28日 在美国审核
Great Phone!!!,"This phone is really great. After searching for months for a reliable yet affordable smart phone, I finally chose BLU and I am so glad I did. The camera is pretty good, the app store is fantastic, and the durability of the phone has been awesome so far. I've dropped it a few times on concrete and it is good as new. The only problem I've had is sometimes the SD card jiggles around when it is dropped, causing me to have to re-install it and reboot the phone. I've also found that the music app from Google play spazzes out sometimes, but that is not BLU's fault. I love how much storage this phone has (expandable) and the screen resolution is big and pretty crisp. Overall, an awesome phone for about 1/4 of the cost of an iPhone. You don't regret this phone...and it's American made which is always a huge plus!",2015年1月13日 在美国审核

I have Straight Talk service and after speaking with their customer service it was determined that the phone was defective. Returned the phone to Amazon and got a replacement. Decided to give the replacement as a gift for Christmas to my daughter instead of using it myself. After the holiday Straight Talk finally got a SIM sent out and the phone was put to use for the first time on January 6, 2015. Everything seemed great. Takes great photos. Call clarity is great. Advertised as a 4G phone but I can only ever get 3G. Didnt bother me much, still responds quickly. Really liked the phone and was happy with the purchase and glad to be able to give it as a gift. Then today, 3 days after powering it up for the first time it no longer works. Had the phone charging on the charger it was sent with. When the phone was checked to see how much longer it needed for a full charge it was dead. It will not power up. Totally dead. We have tried taking the battery out, nothing. Put in a request for yet another replacement because I did like the phone when it worked. Willing to give it one more try but am not expecting great results considering. Really a shame. after reading reviews online it seemed like a great deal but honestly it has just been a massive pain in the rear end. Very frustrating. If the replacement phone gives us any issues I will be switching.",2015年1月9日 在美国审核
"Its a good, solid phone and a very pretty pink!! Im glad I bought it.","After reading many reviews, I purchased this phone to replace my Galaxy III. I've had it for 4 days and I really like it. I keep finding out new things about it. I went to YouTube to figure out how to get the MMS working. After I entered the APN info many different times, everything was fine. I still can't figure out how to open my contacts to make changes without calling the person but I did accidently come across how to screenshot lol. Just hold the down volume key and the on button at the same time and boom...screenshot!! The screen doesn't light up with a new message or email, just sound, but for the price, I really can't complain. I have Straight Talk 4g light but it says 3g at the top on my bar and I havent figured out how to change that either. Also, twice, ive had to go into settings and put it back on my phone number for the internet to work. It seems to boot it off. It uploads videos fast as lightening. Im not sure about this battery. It seems to drain very fast but then again, I have barely put my phone down since I got it. Its going to take some getting use to...its a lot different from my other phone but I must say, its growing on me. Hope this was helpful.",2014年12月26日 在美国审核
Fit and finish is nice. Seemed to work well but soon ran out ...,Bought two of these phones with high expectations. Fit and finish is nice. Seemed to work well but soon ran out of internal memory. Installed mini SD card to supplement. Phone would often unmount SD card for no apparent reason. After using for two months the touch screen on one of the phones became unreliable with dead spots. Called BLU customer support for resolution. They requested that a hard reset be performed which was done to no avail. Called them back and was given an RMA number for repairs. That is when I was informed that there would be a three week turn around with no loaner phone in the iterim. They said that was company policy with no exceptions. What company would expect a customer to go without communications for three weeks? Terrible customer support should equal no customers.,2015年7月6日 在美国审核

Bought this and am thrilled with the speed, clarity, internet access, and camera.This phone feels top notch and performs beautifully.I have rarely been so satisfied with a purchase of an unknown brand.It's comparable to finding a great micro-brew or local winery that you had not tried before.Buy This Product!!!!",2014年12月2日 在美国审核
love this phone.!!,"I absolutely love this phone. I got the yellow which is basically almost a neon yellow &amp;it catches everybody's eye &amp;they really think its sweet.Pros: It responds great, it is very snappy, huge display screen, great OS... basically amazing all the way around. Takes pretty decent pics.Cons: sometimes WiFi stops connecting so I get a 'no network connection' message... All I do is turn the WiFi setting off and then on again and it seems to b fine.I am a girl who likes to download icon changers and change the way my icons look, and it will NOT allow me to do that with any of the applications I've downloaded for that on this phone. ... ??.:(Some widgets won't refresh or load correctly and when that happens I just do a basic reboot and it.all works great then.Not too many cases out there for this specific model yet that I've found, but in reality it really doesn't need a case. Just a good screen protector and its pretty much good to go.Only takes a standard sim not a micro or whatever else, which did not state in the original product information and description. so I had to wait for my new sized sim to get here after I already had the phone for a few days.

BLU Studio 5.0C HD Phone review,"My wife loves her phone. Personally I don't like these gigantic phones, I want my old flip phone back from 2005. But she likes to play games and stuff, and she has a giant new handbag I just bought her for Christmas to carry it around, so she absolutely loves it.. Its fast and she hasn't had any problems with it yet. No problems running any apps either. it seems to be an all around solid product and well thought out..The camera is really good also and has some nice features such as panoramic pictures, takes a snapshot with the video and some other cool stuff. Normally I don't like when companies add their software on my device. I like to download my own software. But Blu added a few programs just to enhance the hardware and I think they did a good job.. no other extra so called ""bloatware"" on the phone.The sound can be almost obnoxiously loud and is stunningly clear. Hard to believe all of that sound is coming out of that thing. The sound and camera were a few of those things I figured I would have to sacrifice with a less expensive phone but once again I was unexpectedly pleasantly surprised.We use T-Mobile and the signal is strong, crisp and clear. We did have some connection problems trying to run google maps while driving but that is probably expected depending where the towers are. But as a phone, we have not had any dropouts or issues.I think it has a 2000mah battery in it but while she is playing games a lot she says the battery seems to go down pretty fast. So she has to make sure she charges it before the day is out to make sure the battery doesn't die in the middle of the night because she relies on the alarm to wake her up in the morning. But to be fair, they give you all this power in sound and picture quality, that doesn't mean you have to blast the sound and set the brightness to 100% all of the time.. Its up to the user to regulate their battery power and use it wisely. Many of the cheap Chinese motherboard manufacturers deliberately set the sound and video gain down so low in an effort to make it appear it has a better battery, and this makes them almost unusable in certain situations . Buy these MTK Processors are surprisingly powerful and the more power you get, the more power you are going to consume from the battery.So it's a tradeoff with performance and battery life, and I am happy with that.Overall, great phone in my opinion..I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if I ever give in and decide to get a gigantic phone for myself or if I want to carry around a computer in my pocket. Meanwhile, I have my old G2X from 2011 that works just fine for my needs and its still too big even though it only has like a 3inch screen.So thats my opinion and I am sticking to it!",2015年1月19日 在美国审核

Nothing better for the price,I bought this phone for my wife and she loves it. The screen is as big as a Galaxy. The main downside is that it only connects to 3G networks but we haven't noticed any slowdowns. When we took it to the ATT store to get a new sim card for it (it uses a larger size card so if you have a micro or mini you'll need to go to your provider to get a new one) and the representative was so impressed with what you get for the money that he went online and ordered one for himself. I assume he could get a hefty discount on an iPhone or Galaxy so this is a great deal for the money.,2015年1月15日 在美国审核

"For the price, you better at LEAST consider this phone!","I can start by saying this, for a 5 inch screen phone that is dual SIM, Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box, and unlocked for only $150, you should give this phone a hard look. I write this review as someone who has owned a BLU phone in the past. And it was not a pleasant experience. I owned a BLU Advance 4.0 and it was horrible. Out of the box (4 inch screen, 4.2 Android stock, dual SIM, $89) it was slow, clunky, not very responsive, laggy, locked up a lot, and had one of the worst displays I have seen on a phone (not to mention horrific viewing angles). That being said, I am surprised I took another chance on a BLU phone. So far I am very glad I did.PHONE: Like I mentioned, it is a 5 inch display. It looks great! I am coming from a busted Galaxy S3 and it looks like it wants to hang with it. It has a noticeably larger screen but doesn't seem to be heavier by much. Fantastic viewing from all angels and the screen is responsive to all touches so far. It is a dual SIM phone which is great if you have the need.PERFORMANCE: This is where it gets dinged a single tick, but really it is only because it can't hang with the $400-600 phones. And we can't expect it to for $150. That being said, it is still performing VERY WELL! Responsive to everything, no lagginess, apps open quickly, no hangs or mystery reboots so far (all things I experienced with the Advance 4.0). It is running Android 4.4 KitKat under the hood and it is a bonebare version. No bloatware. No apps you have to root the phone just to delete. It is great. For a budget phone, it offers surprising performance.BATTERY: It will burn quickly, but then again it seems most smartphones will. Download Juice Defender or Battery Doctor and this becomes a non-issue.HANDLING: It is a ""4G"" phone. I say that because on AT&amp;T's network 4G is pretty much their 3G with a different name. If it isn't LTE (WHICH THIS PHONE IS NOT), but says 4G you are using AT&amp;T or TMobile's HSPA+ network which is a revamped 3G network giving more reliability and a fraction more speed. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE EXPECTING 4G LTE. Because you will be disappointed. Otherwise, I am on WiFi most of the time so I am happy. Calls are crisp, the UI is nice, all around this is a very pleasant experience.EXTRAS: When you order it seems any phone from BLU you get a very nice set of in ear headphones, a screen protector (which like all you need to be Jesus on Adderall to properly install with no bubbles), a silicone gel case, and wall charger/USB cable; none of which seem cheap or flimsy. I use them all very happily. A very nice bonus that you don't get when buying phones from most any other company.OVERALL: This phone is for the budget minded with it's price point of $150, but it doesn't want to act like it. It can't hang performance wise with phones like the Samsung Galaxy S3/4, HTC One X, etc. but it certainly tries. And its flashy colored cases will draw attention (I got the sky blue). It is a great phone for what they ask you to pay. And for that alone you should give it a look. I decided on this phone instead of a refurbed Galaxy S3 for $20-40 more. And I am very happy with my choice so far, and this is from someone who BLU truly let down with the last phone I bought from them. It looks like BLU is now making me a believer.",2014年10月23日 在美国审核

This is the one I give five stars (and Amazon for their service). Going from an escalating AT&amp;T bill I found this phone and coupled with Straight Talk I couldn't be happier. MMS took me a bit to figure out but now that it's working this phone is a great value. Don't get hung up on 1080p, etc. as on a small screen 720 is ridiculous and the processor power keeps things flying. Lastly, the camera does a good job and is quick to capture the image.

STAY AWAY!!,"At first glance, this phone seems like a great value. With a big bright crisp screen, quad core processor, and high resolution camera, what more can you want? As a matter of fact, I bought it when it was on sale for $109 which is even cheaper than the $140 it costs at the time of this review. And in a lot of ways, it is a great value, that is unless you plan on actually using it. The battery life is absolutely HORRENDOUS. You lose a percentage point for almost every minute you use this phone for any basic feature like web browsing or texting. No way can it make it through a day of moderate use without a recharge. On to the next issue. This company has horrible customer service and no guaranteed update support. The phone is stuck on 4.4.2 KitKat with no update to the latest KitKat, nevermind the newest version of Android, Lollipop. It may never receive the update. So if you're looking for update support and battery life, this phone is not for you. Do yourself a huge favor, forget about this phone and buy yourself a Moto G (2014) for a measly $40 more than this phone would cost you. You get a significantly better battery, it's actually not even comparable. It lasts all day. On top of that, you have GUARANTEED update support from a trusted company like Motorola. They already released the Android Lollipop on it, and it has a better Qualcomm brand processor than the generic low grade processor the BLU phone uses. For the price difference, it's a no brainer.

Device functions as fast as other brands and is really light. screen resolution and quality are great, camera is not that good in poor lightening shots but does a great job outdoors in a sunny day. the only thing I don't like about this modelits the poor battery life this thing drains quickly from regular web browsing ,watching you tube or playing games.",2016年1月15日 在美国审核

Good but the launcher is evil,The only bad thing to say about Blu's phones is their custom launcher that's baked into them. Sure you can get nova launcher and a custom locker if you choose but the main launcher always has to be running which sops a bit of ram and cpu speed. On the upside with this phone you don't notice it!The screen is bright with decent contrast and colors. So far there's nothing my boyfriend has thrown at it that it hasn't tackled with flying colors.,2015年1月12日 在美国审核

Great phone at a great price point,"Pros:-Excellent price point, given how quickly you have to upgrade phones these days-Great phone for day to day use-Stock android experience without any of the manufacturer's garbage loaded onto the phone-Dual SIM (very helpful if you are traveling overseas i.e. no need to swap out your home country SIM)Cons:-Low internal memory - (you will use up the 2GB quickly, it is best to add a memory card)-Low RAM-Low resolution for front facing cameraReview Update:After using the phone for a month or so. I have the following comments:-Applications like Google Maps tend to crash from time to time and researching online I came to the conclusion that this was a low RAM issue. Most of the higher priced Android phones come with 4GB of RAM.-When travelling overseas, you may not be able to use HSPA+ internet and may only be limited to 2g speeds. I used the phone on China Mobile and only got 2g even though I had a 4g plan.Bottom line - the phone has the above issues but they are not deal breakers. Great for regular use.",2014年11月5日 在美国审核

For Those of Us Who Live Within Our Means,"I purchased this phone for our daughter's 18th birthday. She has wanted an I-phone for so long, but I just could'nt find one I deemed a reasonable price. I purchased a refurbished I-pod touch 4s several years ago for her. Even though we could easily afford to purchase a new I-phone, it just doesn't make good financial sense to purchase or worse lease to buy, ""with 0.00 down."" I searched the internet for so long to find a phone that I thought would make her happy, and lo and behold I stumbled upon the BLU series of phones. She is thrilled with it, and I can put aside more money for her college account. It far surpasses what she expected. For the one or two things she does that she wanted an I-phone for, she uses her I-pod. Her I-pod used to go everywhere with her, now she just takes her BLU phone. By the way, we use Straight Talk for our phone service and rarely have any issues with our service.",2015年2月4日 在美国审核

"The best, most affordable, high end, unlocked dual SIM Phone!",I rank this phone right up there with the big name brands like the Samsung Galaxy. It has all the features but costs way less (maybe even have some additional features that they don't). Takes excellent pictures and videos - true high definition. Maybe the night pictures could be a bit better though. Just ensure you turn down the display brightness to conserve on battery power. My battery was draining very quickly and found this to be the cause after some time. I added a 32GB micro SD memory card and can basically now take unlimited pictures and videos without worrying about running out of storage space.

Shipped the wrong color,"This is in regards to what they sent me. I ordered the yellow version but they sent me a white one. I'm a little bit upset because I really wanted the yellow one.Other than that, the phone itself is really well at first impression. The screen is nice, not a flagship phone resolution but very well for price. This was meant to replace the LG G2 so I was a little spoiled before this phone. Camera is very comparable to the Nexus 4 8mp camera. Touch screen so far is quite responsive but definitely not the fastest but that's not a complaint. Like most people say, it's mostly stock android which is nice.Phone size is quite big but is still comfortable. It's nearly the same size as the Galaxy Note 3 but narrower. It feels sturdy even with the plastic back cover. Speakers work well, louder than my old G2 which is nice.Overall for the price I like it a lot for now. I just wish I got the yellow...Also they don't mention much but this takes your standard sim card not micro.Edit. After 2 weeks of rigorous use I have more to say.1. You can still use a micro sim, you just need to place it in the right place2. Battery doesn't last as long but this is a 2000mah battery but granted I was used to the G2's 3000mah battery3. This is where I'm a little let down. I can't stream YouTube well even on wifi! It will play for 3 seconds then the picture would freeze as the sound continues.4. The sound is weird. When I start to play music or and sound is about to start, it would gradually get the set volume level instead of instant. I don't know if it's a defect or it is just like that.5. Although the front camera has good pixels, the lighting is horrible... So many dark shadows even in high lit place.6.The touch screen is a little laggy but manageableAgain keep in mind these are my experience and may differ for you. Also remember you're paying for a $150 phone not a $600+ flagship phone. So if you don't expect much then you're fine.

Christmas Gift,I purchased this phone for my mother's Christmas gift. The phone runs great for her needs. The screen is large and the speaker works great. I was a little concerned given the price but overall it's a great phone for the money.A couple of items I've noticed the battery life is poor and the screen locked up a couple of times although I don't know if it was the phone or because I had the wrong Sim card in it. My mom has straight talk that said we had to buy the activation kit for $60 but still not bad for no contract and a smart phone.I would recommend this phone but with an extra or extended life battery.I'll update review should my opinion change on the function of the phone.,2014年12月30日 在美国审核

I have noticed the resolution isn't as good as my Galaxy S4, but that's only because I'm a stickler for those things, and my wife will absolutely never even notice the difference.

Battery drains VERY quickly when using high accuracy location setting. Avoid it unless you can charge immediately.,Upgrading to 3 stars after 6 months of use.

Excellent value! Your cheap phone doesn't have to look or feel cheap!,"I ordered the phone a couple days ago and my initial impressions are that this is a very nice phone for the money. I previously owned a Moto G, and this is similar in terms of quality.Initial impressions:1) The phone is VERY pink. Not unpleasantly so, but much more PINK than the iPhone 5C, for example. The boldness of the pink is muted somewhat by the enclosed TPU case. The case fits well and is included free.2) The enclosed screen protector is of poor quality. I will wait until another company makes one and then add one. Without one, the screen does collect fingerprints fairly easily. come armed with a microfiber cloth if this bothers you.3) Text, movies, etc all look nice on the phone, and it is pleasant to hold. It is weighty enough to feel ""not cheap,"" but not heavy enough to feel HEAVY.4)Dual sims were easy to assign/manage5) The camera takes surprisingly good pictures! There are also several settings and modes available from within the app.These are initial impressions. I will update the review in a few days to give an opinion on battery life.Hope this helps someone!UPDATE...BATTERY LIFE:So far, battery life appears to be low average. Keep in mind that this is with very moderate use. I don't play games,and I don't really stream a lot of music or videos. You should be able to get through the day with basic use. If you stream music or play a bunch of games, pack a charger.UPDATE...Software:The phone ships with pretty much stock Android. There is no Google Now in the launcher when swiping to the right, though. A few curious inclusions, given the lack of space: the olden-day Android browser as well as Chrome. The old stock SMS app in addition to Hangouts. You'd think they'd leave the former items off when space is at a premium. Blessedly, though, most non-essentials are left off of this, and most everything works with very little lag.I am using a third-party launcher and everything works well.Someone asked about dual sims: I am pairing a Lycamobile voice PAYGO sim (I make very few calls)with a Red Pocket $10/1gb data sim to get service for roughly $12/mo. The ability to do this increases this phone's value tremendously. In the US, most of us are unfamiliar with this setup. I am around Wifi most of the day, so 1gb/mo is sufficient for me. This phone offers users the flexibility of truly shopping around for service, and the ability to mix and match carriers for the best value. The sims are standard (mini) sim card sized sims...not the micro sims many new phones are currently using.UPDATE: 2 WEEKS LATERI am very happy with the phone. It works just as well as many other more expensive phones I've owned...no issues at all during this time. One other point: I **never drop my phones. Three days ago, it was in my sweater pocket and fell out, about 3 feet down, screen first, onto a hard ceramic tile floor!!!! I was certain it was toast. I picked it up, turned it over...and not a scratch!!!So, I can say definitively that it is durable, too!!UPDATE: IT'S BEEN A MONTHI can definitively recommend the phone. I have had zero issues over the last month. Everything works as it should, and for the price, you really can't beat it -- especially when you figure in the functionality of using dual sims from different carriers to price out calls/texts/data. The only negative, and it's certainly a minor one, has been the fingerprint issue. Oh my goodness, does the screen collect prints. This was marginally improved with a screen protector.BE AWARE: Amazon is lumping reviews of this phone (5.0C HD)in with the product page for the Mini version also, which has a smaller, less crisp screen, lesser camera, etc. Another reviewer in the comments section pointed this out, so I thought I would highlight that info here.

Seriously? Major disappointment with overall experience. C-,Wait time was as posted. Crazy to wait two weeks just for it to ship. Package drove by our house twice within two miles. Once to UPS 35 miles away and then to local post office. Both times traveling within two miles of my house. Packaging was nice but different than other blu packaged products that I am used to. Phone feels lite and nice.Cons. Screen protector was crinkled and had bubbles. Data claimed to be 4g+ with straight talk and only showed 3g. 4.4.2 KitKat OS was NOT the same as other blu phones with that same OS. Battery SUCKS!

"Great features, great price","As someone who uses Net 10, I'm used to having to settle for crap phones or having to fork over $400+ for a decent phone. This phone changed all that. My last phone was the HTC One X, and the screen on this phone blows my HTC out of the water. At 5 inches, it's big enough to comfortably browse web pages or watch Netflix without having to resort to a phablet. Touch screen is fast and responsive and scrolling is smooth. I had no trouble with the phone recognizing my SIM card, and the APN settings were easy to change. Everything works great with the Net 10 service, even the MMS messaging. The screen protector and case are included, but not of the highest quality. They will likely protect your phone from scratches and scuffs but not from a hard impact. There is no LTE, but in my area HPSA is just as fast. Web pages load fast and streaming works great. The only drawback is the 4gb of onboard storage. I popped in a 16 gb SD card and moved most of my apps there. The phone is definitely eye-catching. I have the yellow (ordered the pink- thanks for that, Amazon) and it is very bright! I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. If you're looking for a flagship phone, the Blue Studio 5.0 C HD will likely disappoint you, but if you want a solid phone with great features for under $150, this is a great choice. Five stars for the phone, but one star for Amazon for shipping the wrong color.",2014年8月23日 在美国审核

Pros/Cons,"First and foremost, I have used this phone for about a month. That way I would have used it extensively to come up with a list of pros and cons, some of which can be deal breakers for those thinking about purchasing this phone.Pros:- Quad-core processor, it is very responsive and snappy- 5.0"" screen, anything larger than this would be too cumbersome to carry around- Call and mic quality is sufficient, no problems from anyone that I've talked to- Supports 64GB microSD cards, even though the box says 32GB- Some apps can be moved to SD card, a feature that was not available on my old 4.1 JellyBean phone- Dual-Sims, to create your own customized plan with 2 different carriers. I used one for talk and text, while the other one is for data.- Included earbuds are decent and have a mic. Most other stock earbuds are absolute junkCons:- Speakerphone on the back, it is downright awful. You can hear this popping sound every time the speaker turns on or off. Music playback has way too much static and distortion through the speaker.- Freezes occasionally. I've had to take out the battery to reset it. I'm not sure if it is the phone or an unresponsive app that is doing it.- Battery life, it is a little on the weak side. However turning off mobile data helped improve battery life quite a bit.- No 5GHz WiFi, something that my old phone did have.So far I've had to pull the battery out twice because it was not responding. However, when it is running well it is very responsive. This could be a deal breaker for some. Overall I do like this phone, the specs, the features, and the color too. It is a unique phone from a brand that not everyone is familiar with, so I gave them a chance. So far it is well worth it despite some minor flaws and setbacks.Edit 10/30/14: It turns out that I had a faulty micro SD card that caused my phone to freeze up. I popped in a new one and all the freezing issues went away.",2014年9月28日 在美国审核

"Best Phone Under $400, and at $140... WOW! A Must Buy!!","I should start of by saying wow... WOW BLU! This phone is amazing!!Specs of this phone:Mobile Features: 3G network Bluetooth 3.0 GPRS: class 12 EDGE: class 12 microUSB 2.0 Internal memory: 4GB microSD card slot, up to 32GB WLAN: 802.11 b/g/n Android 4.4 (KitKat) OS 1.3GHz Cortex-A7 quad-core processor 8MP camera with LED flash 2MP secondary camera 1080p Full HD video Browser: HTML5 Java MIDP emulator Document viewer Photo/video editor Accelerometer, proximity MP4/DivX/Xvid/WMV/H.264/H.263 playerTechnical Profile: Talk time: up to 10 h Standby time: up to 720 h Battery: Li-Ion 2000mAhDisplay: 5"" IPS touchscreen 16M colors Resolution: 720 x 1280~ I will tell you not-so-briefly why this phone is golden:1. The phone's screen is a perfect size! It was bigger than I thought it would be, so be prepared! It's not too big, though, and it fits perfectly in any pocket.2. The screen's resolution is top-notch. Even though the PPI (pixels per inch) density isn't that high (294 ppi, the same as the Moto G 2014 Version), the screen is very high-def. I tried watching 1080p on YouTube and it was wonderful!3. The camera is just as good as any Samsung Galaxy phone out there. Don't let the offsetting 8 megapixels fool you, it takes great pictures and videos! My friend has a Galaxy Note 3, which has a 16 megapixel camera, and we both took almost identical pictures. There was barely ANY difference. Megapixels determines the size of the photo (resolution), but when the photos are zoomed out, they look the same. TWO THINGS you can do on the camera are take panorama photos and multi-angle photos, which is yet another plus!4. Android 4.4 KitKat is wonderful on this phone. The selection of apps on the Google Play Store is great.5.Even though the processor's Ghz isn't that high, it's fine for virtually any game/video. For those of you that don't know, a processor determines how much of a beating your phone can take at one time. I think a 2.5-2.7 ghz processor has never been used to its full potential by everyday users, so this phone's processor will suffice. Again, this phone is $140!6. The phone comes in sturdy packaging and a case, earbuds, and a screen protector are included! Most phones come in a cheap plastic box that is 70% empty, but this packaging is a hard, lightweight plastic, in which all of the space is used. The case is a good, sturdy material and the earbuds would sell around $15 MSRP if they were in a store, good quality! The screen protector is OKAY, but hey, it's free with the phone.The only things I have found to be okay about the phone are the battery life and the in-call volume. You should get through a day with moderate usage (a few games, some video streaming, etc.). The in-call volume is fairly quiet, even at the highest level.---TIPS IF YOU ARE BUYING:A. You may want to be cautious if you are wearing sweatpants, basketball shorts, etc. because the phone will slip out of your pocket if you have the case on. This has happened to me a few times, and it can be resolved by buying a different case (not a big selection) or putting your phone some place other than your pocket.B. I recommend putting the screen protector on as soon as you get the phone because it reduces the amount of fingerprints and grease that gets on your screen (it attracts a lot).C. Turn your screen brightness all the way down most of the day. This gives you at least a 25% longer battery life! The lowest screen brightness can still be seen easily.D. Some people are complaining that this phone says it has 4G speeds when it actually doesn't. The truth is, it doesn't have 4G speeds. A phone doesn't determine the internet speeds, your carrier does. Just thought you should know!The only other phone even close to this quality under $400 is another BLU phone, the Life Pure XL, which is still $379.Overall a FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC phone from BLU! Best-performing phone I've ever had.. HANDS DOWN!UPDATE,10/22/14:I have found out a few more things about this phone, so I'll give some more tips.1. With some of the money you save buying this phone, if you do buy it, I HIGHLY recommend you get these two things: A. 16 gigabyte SD card. The phone's internal memory is supposedly 4 GB, but it's actually about 2.3 GB. This is probably because Android 4.4 takes up a lot of space. When you get the SD card, in the settings, make the default write disk the SD card, so all of your music, videos, and MOST, not all, of the apps you download will go to the SD card, saving you some internal memory for the apps that don't go there. B. A portable charger. This is totally up to you, but it can come in handy on long road trips or even if you just don't want to stretch the charger cord from the outlet. I bought the K-Max 11200 mah portable charger, and it works just great! It can charge this phone 5 times on a single use. You can find it here: http://www.amazon.com/KMAX-806-Flashlight-Generation-SGH-T959V-BlackBerry/dp/B00BN42G5Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1414002547&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kmax+portable+charger2. Something else I discovered: how to take a screenshot. Hold down the power button and the volume down button and the same time until the phone takes the shot.Also, sometimes the default browser crashes on me so I have started to use Chrome (surprisingly). It works fine, so I recommend that too.This phone is still running like it did out of the box on day 1, after almost 2 weeks of use. I think I'll have this phone for a very long time.ANOTHER UPDATE, 5/31/2015:I recently broke this phone by accidentally sitting on it, and the whole device broke and the screen stopped working. Now I'm moving onto a different phone that isn't BLU, after realizing there are better deals out there. The phone was fantastic while it lasted though!",2014年10月14日 在美国审核

The Studio 5.0 C is a solid budget alternative to the Moto G,"This is my first BLU phone purchase, and I have to say... I am impressed! The build quality is a lot better than I expected it to be considering the price point, and as such, it feels great in hand. The screen is solid, the speaker gets super loud without sounding distorted, and the overall Google experience on this phone is really snappy.I'd argue this is just as good as a Moto G, barring a few things here and there, such as onboard storage being limited to 4GB on this phone, no HD LTE version, and no gorilla glass or water proofing. Not having those features isn't a big deal for me though, as I'm not an app hoarder and am fine with 3G/4G HSPA+ connectivity. Water proofing is nice I guess, but I make it a point to not get any of my electronics wet in the first place, and a screen protector (and case!) is included with the packaging. The phone also comes with decent in-ear headphones. Big ups for using flat wiring for the headphones and the included USB cable to prevent tangling.Also, upon installing a Samsung 32GB EVO SDHC, the camera app defaulted to the microSD card for its storage location which was convenient (in the past I've had to specify that, or it wasn't even an option). All in all, again, I'm really impressed with this offering from BLU. If you're looking for a relatively cheap, unlocked phone that runs smooth and has a great 5"" 720p display, the Studio 5.0 C HD should be on your radar. Its first impression pretty much blew me away.As an aside, Amazon sent me the wrong color. I wanted the super bright neon green/yellow one but I got a white variant instead. Sorted it out with Amazon Customer Service and they sent me a same-day delivery replacement, free of charge (should be here today actually). Minor hiccup, but that had nothing to do with the device. My experience with the white version I'm going to be returning has been top notch.",2014年8月30日 在美国审核

Did not like this product,"Looking at many 5 star comments done previously for this product, I decided to buy this phone and I was very excited. First shipping was very late. I got this product almost 9 days after I placed an order. After getting this phone I figured out that internal memory space is only 2GB.I bought SD card and the problem was sorted out. After 4 days of using this phone, the screen froze completely. I restarted it and had same problem. I was able to contact Amazon and they agree to replace my order. I took me couple of hours to disable all my accounts because the touchscreen did not work properly.Please be careful before buying this product.",2014年12月2日 在美国审核
