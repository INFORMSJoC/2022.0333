Great phone at a great price,"Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.",2020年10月3日 在美国审核

"Great phone, marred by some pretty big issues.","I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.",2020年11月18日 在美国审核
Bait &amp; Switch?,When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.,2020年10月4日 在美国审核
This phone is AMAZING!!! Ignore bad reviews.,"To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT.",2021年1月12日 在美国审核

"Finally, a (quality) Samsung phone to compete with OnePlus. (Early review - Purchased @ TMobile)","I've been a OnePlus fan for years. I've owned a OnePlus 3, 6, and (currently) a 7t. They've always been solid phones at a solid price, undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.<br>So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I'm so happy with the 7t?Well, I have to confess. I'm getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.Then there's this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t, I've been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah, I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t's wide-angel lens isn't all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x, not 2x or even 3x.So if I wanted a better camera setup, why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras, but I'm not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it's 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it's 5x zoom? Nuts.$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?Now *that* was worth a look.I'm glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out, and this is still an early review (I've only had the phone for a couple of days), but so far I'm duly impressed.Now I won't belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8, not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.So what follows is a quick rundown of the good, the bad, and the meh. I don't think there's really anything ""ugly,"" just a little ""meh.""The Good...* I've never been a fan of the Samsung ""Edge"" style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice, flat, vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks, 6.5"" form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah, and it does 120hz, but for battery life purposes I've dialed mine back to 60hz. I'm not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I've seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn't squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865, but I don't have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser, password manager, camera, news feeds, social media, etc.)* The battery life has been good so far, and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it's app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing, a couple of Youtube videos, some social media, LOTS of messaging, a couple of calls.* &lt;drumroll&gt; The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It's a bona-fide wide-angle, too, unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle, producing nearly identical exposures and saturation, with plenty of detail. Sure, everyone's crazy about megapixels, but 12m is plenty for most applications and I've printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now, the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes, 8mp is a tad skimpy, but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms, 8mp 3x optical is... well, it's workable. So far the results are not only usable, but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable, though I wouldn't use them for blow-ups. At 20x, detail is dropping off fast, far earlier than the ""space"" zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well, they're unusable. At this price point, though, the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I'm paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups, so I'm getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don't do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.* Memory Card slot. Why can't Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn't Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!* Oh yeah, and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn't as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste, another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full. ""Passably."" This is no Bose Soundbar. It's just not annoying. ;)The Bad* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on, Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?* Plastic back. Some people don't like this. I'm fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you're spoiled by all-glass backs, this isn't going to win you over.* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher, tune it to your taste, and move on. OnePlus has a clean, crisp UI and that's the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.* 6gig of RAM? Come on, Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don't need 12gig, and I've never pushed my phone to those limits, but please, it's time to grow up and beef up the RAM, even at this price point.The Meh* 5G performance is good when you can find it, but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don't need 5G. I'm not streaming 8k to my phone. I'm just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.* Please, for the love of the UNIVERSE, kill BIXBY! Bixby, Bixby, Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa, it's utterly, completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties, the volume buttons should fall under the index finger, not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb, as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung, not so much.* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can't tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea, Samsung. (Correction, just take inspiration from it. :) )Bottom line...This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it's in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it's a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8.</br>",2020年10月4日 在美国审核
"Great value, totally worth it.","Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.",2020年10月15日 在美国审核
"Why you should consider buying this phone, and what the reviewers fail to mention.","This is a fantastic phone.I bought this phone before it became available on Amazon at Best Buy, but I thought potential buyers would be interested in these attributes of the Samsung 21 FE.Positives (in no particular order):1) Excellent camera.It takes night pictures with a quality that is almost beyond belief.Yes, the night mode takes a little while to process, but it is quite worth it.I was able to capture an image that had stars visible in the image.I've never had that on a cell phone.The daytime images are comparable to the iPhone 13, which are quite good.Something the reviewers fail to mention with the camera is the Field of View, which is 79 degrees, or equivalent to around 26.5 mm, full frame, which is just a tad narrower than the iPhone 13, and quite a bit narrower than the s21 ultra which is around 24 mm, and the s22 ultra which is reported at coming in at 23 mm, with a FOV of 86 degrees.This is not acceptable as this will lead to significant distortion when taking pictures of people at closer range with the main camera.It may be possible to correct through algorithms using the AI, but the subjects will always be smaller. It seems there is a trend toward having much wider lenses on the main camera which doesn't really make sense considering there are ultra wide lenses on most of these phones. I fear this may be the last flagship grade Samsung to have a FOV as narrow as 79 degrees on the main lens with this level of quality.2) Thermal throttling.Yes, this is actually an advantage.The Snapdragon (SD) 888 was know to run hot, and the SD 8 Gen 1 is even hotter.Most people do not need that type of bleeding edge of performance. This phone actually runs quite cool. Most people don't want their phone to turn into a frying pan in order to squeak out an extra bit of performance, and if they do, then they will get a proper gaming phone like an Asus ROG.3) Battery life.I've seen conflicting reviews concerning battery life. Some reviewers see more that adequate battery life, while others find it lacking. Personally, I find battery life excellent with this phone.4) Aspect ratio and associated size. This phone has an aspect ration of 19.3:9. This is excellent news for those that find that phones have gotten too long and skinny making them difficult to be placed in a pocket or a purse.Not to mention, most content is still 16:9, which is more enjoyable to use on this aspect ratio.Very few reviewers will cover this.5) Excellent signal reception as per typical Qualcomm excellence with their radios.6) Many more updates available through Android 15 and a years worth of security updates beyond that.The S20 FE will only have till Android 13 and 1 year of security updates beyond this. This is increasingly important from a security perspective.This phone is not perfect, though, as indicated below:1) Weak haptic motor.Haptic motor is not very strong on this phone.2) People mention lack of glass back.I'm not sure how relevant this is as 90% of people buying this phone will put a case on it, myself included. I don't care about the plastic back on this phone. Looks fine to me.3) Price. This is a big one for a lot of people.Many compare it to the Pixel 6.Yeah, on paper that may work, but in the real world, the Pixel 6 is so buggy, it is difficult to use for many.In addition, the signal reception has been found to be lacking in the Pixel 6.A phone, no matter how well spec'd, is useless without a good signal.So, take the Pixel 6 out of your price comparison.That, being said, the price is still a little high, but there are many promotional offers on the phone now.4) Missing headphone jack and sd card slot.This is a disappointing thing for many, myself included, but the positive attributes outweigh this.",2022年1月19日 在美国审核
So close! But look elsewhere,"This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums).

Love the Cloud Mint!,"I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box.

Affordable; just right screen size,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is very responsive and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions.

Samsung S20 FE 5G phone is outstanding!,"The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked.My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully.

I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps.

Big bang for your buck,"This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less thanideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeezein a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found thatif I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitelyget a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend.",2020年12月28日 在美国审核
"very good phone for the price, Samsung bloatware is easier to deal with than in past years","Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.",2020年10月29日 在美国审核
Cable included,"I was alarmed when I got this phone because the included cable plugged into the phone at both ends of the cord.Two small plug-ins.I don't have any adapters that would fit that it make this work as a usb connection.What I realized later is that my old Samsung charging cord works with it, and that has a usb adaptor that can work in my car.The included cable is actually supposed to be used to transfer data from your old phone to your new phone!!How about that?I didn't use that, but used the QR code the new phone gave me and the bluetooth connection and easily transferred all my data, even before I have gotten a sim card for it.Bravo, Samsung.",2022年2月6日 在美国审核
"Flagship updates, features and speeds, at a fraction of the price! BUT NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!!","I've had this phone for quite a while now, and am absolutely loving it. I've been noticing amazing battery life (16 hour days of moderate optimized usage), games amazingly (runs Genshin Impact losing about 9-14% per hour), absolutely NO stuttering, and the camera is pretty good too.Things this phone doesnt do as well as the note 20 ultra.Multitasking. If you want to have more than 3 apps open in the background and resuming where you left off, you wont get that here.Camera. There is 30x, but no 100x, zoom (not a big deal for me, but that might matter for you) And it probably isn't QUITE up to par with the pictures in the end.No pen. The s-pen can be very useful, but you wont get it here.There are a few other small things, but this is all the big things I've noticed.CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT!!!!THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!If none of these things are deal breakers, GO BUY THIS PHONE!

"Great phone, especially for the price.","The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.I apologize for the rant, lol.Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.This phone can also block Apple ID.

120hz screen has issues,"The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone.",2020年10月19日 在美国审核
Love everything about this phone,The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought.I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.Its screen is vibrant and colorful.Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.Some complain about the selfie camera.At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.I never got half a day with my Motorola.I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it.Highly recommend.,2021年10月7日 在美国审核
The best phone of 2020!!!,"Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly. Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!",2021年4月13日 在美国审核
Verizon activation was smooth!,"I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate.I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device.I transferred using Smart Switch app, watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great.No Verizon calls, no Verizon store.This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon.I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn't figure it out.No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!",2021年6月30日 在美国审核
One of the best deals today; we got three of them in our family over the past year,"I believe, it is one of the best deals available for a new, established brand name, Android phone. My son got one of these first, I got one for myself half a year later, and recently we got one for my wife. The reasons which we like this phone are as follows:1) It still accepts SD cards (newer Samsung phones do not). You can add 256 GB of flash memory for pictures and video for $30. The same upgrade of memory with the latest Samsung phone models would cost you about $200 (they charge at least $100 per 128 GB of built-in flash - a street robbery!). If you need more memory, you can plug in SD card with capacity up to 1 TB. You can store huge number of movies on it.2) It comes with a charger. An extra charger never hurts. This is a slow 15 W charger, but it does its job - charges the phone over about 2-3 hours. I usually leave it plugged in overnight.3) This phone has a very good, for a smart phone, battery life. With active use through the day, the battery comfortably lasts through the day. If the phone used only for phone calls and occasional e-mail checks, the battery will last for two days or longer.4) Cameras work quite well. Resolution is good, image quality is good. The phone has three camers with different focal length, plus front side camera. Perfectly sufficient for all reasonable uses.5) The screen is big, but not excessively huge. The phone is just right size to fit into the hand comfortably.6) We use it on ATT prepaid plan. It is fully compatible with ATT Wireless and is fully supported.7) It is nominally 5G, but this in reality translates into more DRAM and a little better camera and nothing more. There is no true 5G in the U.S. (thankfully - I do not want to carry a microwave source next to my body!). If you go to ATT web page, you will learn that there are three flavors of 5G, the first two of them are nothing but marketing tricks.AT&amp;T 5G using low-band spectrum reaches more than 277 million people in more than 18,000 cities and towns in the U.S. This is slightly upgraded 4G LTE. There is nothing 5G in it. This is what you get from all major carriers, sold to you as ""5G"". It is just a little bit faster than regular 4G.AT&amp;T 5G+ using recently introduced C-Band spectrum sits between our other two bands and provides a great combination of ultra-fast speeds and wide geographic coverage. This has very little availability, and it is still not true 5G yet.AT&amp;T 5G+ using millimeter wave spectrum delivers super-fast speeds and unprecedented performances in high traffic areas including parts of more than 40 cities and more than 40 stadiums and venues. Availability of this is extremely limited in very limited selection of places, pretty much, nowhere.8) All three S20 FE phones in our family so far have been working very well, they are solid, reliable, and well made.The downsides are few. One, I am missing a headphone jack. I have a couple of Boise noise cancelling headphones (no BT) which I would like to be able to connect. With this phone, I need a USB-C to headphone jack adapter to accomplish it. $10 - $15 is not a big deal, but it is very easy to lose.Second downside, this phone still has that useless, annoying Bixby, but it got less annoying compared to my old phone. Finally, there are very few pre-installed apps and very little work is needed to clean them up.I do not play games on the phone, so I cannot judge if it is good for gaming. Probably, for latest games one needs the newest, fastest phone. For youtube or movies stored on the phone, it works perfectly well.The screen has good resolution and is silky smooth, at 120 Hz.I am convinced, it is a great phone to get in the Android family, as long as it is available.",2022年5月23日 在美国审核
Best of the S20 in a cheaper(but not worse) package,"Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap, I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone, definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to, coming from the S8, but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great, lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left, go to sleep, wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight, so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great, not a professional camera reviewer, go check out reviews on YouTube.",2020年10月17日 在美国审核
Great phone!,"I'm a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7, and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven't been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone, DO IT!

Decent phone for the money,"This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice.Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.The screen is vibrant with deep colors &amp; good contrast.Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.<br>Setup was a breeze.I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue.</br>",2022年3月15日 在美国审核

This is the perfect phone(that is not an iphone),"I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone.

Great Phone by Samasung,"Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone, smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn't have a charger with the package) the camera is great, I'm a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics, another good feature is that is made in South Korea, some parts maybe made in China, but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice.

Better than expected,"Edit: I'm a super heavy user.I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.Love the phone.Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:one month in, and I love it!Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.Signal is great on tmobile.5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!Updates get sent all the time.So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.The only things it didn't bring over werepaid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!",2020年11月27日 在美国审核

I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up ""MKBHD S20FE"" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!",2021年5月26日 在美国审核
Flagship Features at a Great Price.,"After some research, I settled on this S20 FE 5g. It has flagship features for a reasonable price. Better than the S21 as I've learned. After using an iphone 5s for many years, wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging, expandable memory, fast processor, more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&amp;t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day.",2021年6月9日 在美国审核
Everything you need with a little of what you want,"Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine.",2021年1月28日 在美国审核
Impressed,"I've owned the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for several months now and love it.Initially, I didn't like that it didn't include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update.This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area.The battery is excellent.I haven't received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call.The camera is excellent.Although it has 5G capability, I don't know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon.Oh, the top ""ribbon"" is a little tough to read.Its a great phone and at a great price.My wife likes it more than her iPhone.",2021年4月12日 在美国审核
Fun Features. Great battery life.,"I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.<br>I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.</br>",2021年8月3日 在美国审核
Great phone for a great price!,"Very happy with this item. This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though, the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box, the fingerprint sensor works great, but with the screen protector, it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that’s not a limitation on the phone, just the screen protector. Otherwise I’m very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!",2021年4月7日 在美国审核
A really nice phone but with Samsung software,"I love this phone. All of the reviewers' complaints about facial recognition and fingerprint access do not apply to me, because I do not use them. The transition from my old Motorola phone and my S21 FE I did myself with only a few problems. The screen is sharp, the size is comfortable and my applications run smoothly. The only app I have had trouble with is the Contacts app (Samsung), which will not let me edit Contacts. This problem is endemic in the S20s and S21s. I downloaded a Google app for contacts and had no more trouble.",2022年4月20日 在美国审核
"Cheap-o phone for sure, but still alright","I ordered this phone when Amazon said 8gb of ram... Showed up with 6gb, and now the site has been corrected. Good phone though!

TL:DR Worth,"So let's start with the screen.It's beautiful,responsive, reads my fingerprints accurately. And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.Next up is signal.I live in a rural area so service is tricky,but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions,inside a manufacturing plant for example.Camera is on the list too,don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera.It's not the best camera out the,but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.The battery is impressive.I'm kinda hard on my phone battery,and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.All in all,I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.P.S.That Snapdragon is a monster.",2021年1月27日 在美国审核
"Gorgeous, durable phone","This phone is absolutely gorgeous in color, sleek, and has such amazing battery life. I do have to say, I chose the 20 FE specifically for the color and because it has better camera specs than the other phones in the 20 line. I love how fast it is, how well it connects to Bluetooth, the color on the screen, the camera features (both front and rear) and so much more. It is pretty durable too. I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me. I do also have pretty small hands so one-handed use is a little bit difficult even with a ring on the back of my case. Overall, I am very happy with this phone!",2022年3月3日 在美国审核
About the best unlocked Galaxy you can buy,"This is a gem of a phone. Perfect size, high end performance at a mid range price. Superb battery goes for DAYS with moderate usage. Can stream Netflix for 12+ hours on a charge and still have 20 percent left. Premium hardware, Samsung fully supports the US version so you get all the updates. I like the ""unlocked by Samsung"" setup, no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO), get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.This isn't the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can ""buy once, cry once"" and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years. I'm very happy with mine and I think you will be too.",2021年11月21日 在美国审核

Even better in person!!!,"Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5Gas an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far, this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen.",2021年1月10日 在美国审核

Amazing Mid-range Phone!,"I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day.

Best. Upgrade. Ever.,"I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue.",2022年4月6日 在美国审核

So far so good,"Just received the S20 FE today.Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.That was a selling point for me.When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault.",2020年10月4日 在美国审核
Massive upgrade at an affordable price!!,"I did a lot of research before coming to a conclusion to purchase this particular phone and let me tell you, this phone is beyond perfect, a MASSIVE upgrade from my Samsung galaxy S6 edge+.

You as the user have full control on how you want your phone to behave. And to top it all off, at an affordable price!

It feels premium (it basically is) but of course the higher end phones will have better specs and better looking screens. But this is probably the best phone on the market for this prices range. I recommend this phoneit's been treating me well for the past 2 weeks and hopefully it will last me long",2020年11月30日 在美国审核

The elephant in MY room,"What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder whyI wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I ""upgraded"" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software, it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But, again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.Yes it's a good phone, it should have a bit more ram for what it is, I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves.",2021年3月14日 在美国审核

Even my S6 is more premium! This is what happens when you let influencers glow about everything, without calling the downgrades out! I've never been so disappointed in a product.

Touch screen issues!,"If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers, stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different, unintended direction.<br>It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period, it's going back.Other than that, yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price.</br>",2020年11月2日 在美国审核

"Ah, politics...","This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim.",2021年1月29日 在美国审核

Better Than The A Series,"Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds.",2022年3月23日 在美国审核

Not worth the money,"I've by chance had a total of three of these in my family, so have a decent handle on them.For the specs on paper, it seems a good deal.But it's a problematic phone.Firstly, build quality is inconsistent.One was perfect, and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone.Second is battery life...for such a large battery, it doesn't feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues.Just Google it.All of ours have it, and it will drive you nuts.The updates were supposed to help, and did to some extent, but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying.I wouldn't bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted.",2020年10月31日 在美国审核

I've already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn't always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can't delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren't many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use, no bloatware. Just free and empty, lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5.",2020年11月2日 在美国审核
CHECK SYTEM CAPABILITY,the phone I PURCHSED is not compatible with GLOBAL SYSTEM NETWORK,2020年10月10日 在美国审核
Do not buy this phone.  As far as I am concerned this phone is a complete piece of trash.,"The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue.I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal isroaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.The October firmware update helped a bit.The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."".Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung.A screen.That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue.Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.",2020年11月1日 在美国审核
Acceptable phone. Won't impress in any way.,"This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. Themodified version of Android, Samsung's One UI, does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader), but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up, but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought.",2020年11月6日 在美国审核
I guess it all works because it's new,Why am I picking stars on features I do not care about.There is no way I am using Face recognition or a Fingerprint reader.I use the phone to call people and answer text messages.My reason for the feedback is that Amazon placed a $700 brand new phone in a box with one little air bubble wrap and the thing is bouncing around.A little common sense would be great.It's an expensive electronic device.This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this.,2020年12月11日 在美国审核
"Decent, it Depends on Your Priorities","I ended up returning this phone. It’s a really good phone but I just personally didn’t like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. It’s a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I’ve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally.",2020年12月3日 在美国审核
"Great all around phone, disappointing camera and fingerprint reader","Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you",2021年5月31日 在美国审核
The phone does work but with some notable flaws,The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes &gt;5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is &gt;20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9,2020年12月22日 在美国审核
Touch Screen Weird,"I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.One time it stayed ""frozen"" so long that the ""camera app has stopped responding"" thing popped up.",2021年4月8日 在美国审核

After having the phone for 6 months the middle of the phone became a dead spot. Every time I would tap on it nothing would happen. Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones. This is my third one. But, the issues with this phone are things that shouldn't be happening for another 2 years.",2022年3月9日 在美国审核

Also it registers lines which you didn't make.Also unlocking with fingerprint is a nightmare. 70% of the time it doesn't recognize my fingerprint and I have to type my password after five failed entries.Camera is taking the worst photos with not so great coloring and kind of blurry images.Especially with the front camera I was never able to take good picture quality since it is fixed focus.This is the worst phone I have ever has as Samsung.so unhappy with it. and returning it.Not recommended at all!",2021年1月2日 在美国审核

Good value for money if you buy it on sale,"Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it",2022年5月6日 在美国审核

Very good,"Overall, I like the phone.It's fast, stable, and feature packed.I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.",2021年11月20日 在美国审核

AT&amp;T and Samsung both said it is a Dual Sim phone. It is not.,"AT&amp;T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&amp;T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&amp;T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&amp;T network. They didn'thave any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsungonline and it also advertisedthe dual sim US functionality.Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&amp;T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&amp;T's verifyingthis was a Dual sim capableproduct. After receiving it, I used AT&amp;T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferringeverything- apps, passwords,pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidencethat it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean.

Camera Unusable,"I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.<br>Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet.</br>",2021年9月18日 在美国审核
touch screen way too sensitive,"Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen.Even with the ""block accidental touches"" option turned on, it is twitchy and very unpleasant.The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth, which was what I bought it for, so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me.Same for the google pestware.But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.Still, listening to music is a blessing!My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers, it sounds like shit.But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that's the best I'll ever get.",2021年12月15日 在美国审核

Great speakers.,"My previous phone - LG G8 Thinq - was flaking out on me, the battery not holding anything like a proper charge.

The cameras review well and I was able to get a belt clip for it too.The best part by far though are the speakers, far louder and clearer than my previous phone or in fact any previous phone I've owned.

Decent enough phone but battery seems awfully weak,"I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to.

That being said, the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don't know if it's the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but, the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.Oh and, the 5g hasn't blown me away either...

But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer.

Great Phone but a CONFUSING Trade-off,"Ultimately, the S21 FE is a great phone.Before buying the phone, I was pretty skeptical especially after binging hundreds of reviews from the mobile community and YouTube. The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality.",2022年6月20日 在美国审核

Overall it's just okay. Very annoying fingerprint sensor.,The phone has a lot going for it. It's fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it.,2021年9月8日 在美国审核

"Great hardware, annoying to use.","Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear, speaker volume is much louder, things load fast, it's waterproof,, etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone.",2021年11月28日 在美国审核

A really disappointing Samsung product,"Totally disappointed with this phone. First off no charging brick and only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable.Guess they want you to buy a wireless charging pad for $35 to $70 and drag it with you where ever you go. Number 2 disappointment is it has a holder for 2 sim cards but it only uses the number 1 card and the number 2 is only a place holder, it is not a dual sim phone. Number 3, cannot add a micro SD card anywhere for data expansion, guess they want you to buy the more expensive 256 Gb with 8 Gb ram phone rather then providing a Micro SD card holder. And the final deal breaker is that it has very poor 2nd language implementation. When the 2nd language, in this case Thai is set as default language only about 30% if that is changed to Thai and the remaining 70% stays in English. I've had other Samsung and Moto phones where Thai as 2nd language is set as default and close to 95% of the phone is changed. And the problem that is pretty much the same with most Samsung phones is they are stuffed full of useless Samsung apps. Will be returning as paying $650 for this phone at this time is way too much considering what IMHO I don't like about this phone.",2022年3月21日 在美国审核

What the hell,"Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered anotherissue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn't work or if i can't do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it, this isn't ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn't work.

Missing Important Features,I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text.

"Just when I was out, Samsung pulls me right back in.","Around 2 years ago, I ditched my iPhone 8 Plus for a Samsung Galaxy S10e. All at once, I was frustrated with what I was missing sticking with Apple. Why should I continue to pay more for $800+ phoned without OLED screens, with only one camera, and with needlessly restrictive software, when things on the Android side of the smartphone game are better than ever? I switched and never looked back.As my time with the S10e wore on, I was troubled by the direction Samsung seemed to be taking. Their prices were going up, and their technology was not advancing at the rate I had once found wonder in. The S20 starting at $999 was just icing on the cake of fear; had Samsung led us all on? What phone was next for me when my S10e finally gave up the ghost? I pushed away OnePlus, Google, and other midrange phone manufacturers for months; until the announcement came.I picked up my S20 FE 5G on launch day, and have been blown away by it every second of ownership. For a $700 dollar phone, it blows all preconceived notions of ""midrange"" out of the water. For starters, the screen is absurd. An HDR10+, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED of this size? Are you kidding? It's amazing. And the 4500 mAh battery has no issues driving it; I've gone a couple of days between charges by this point. The cameras are absurd too, especially the 32 MP selfie camera; the sharpness is honestly too much sometimes.Also, the plastic back is nothing to worry about in the slightest. Not only is it actually aesthetically pleasing, but it's solid and easy to grip. I have no qualms there. The phone as a whole is lightning-fast in kind. As a Verizon user, my 5G experience is very limited, so I can't attest to it's usefulness in this review; but I'm sure it's fine!My only qualm with this phone would have to be the bloatware; we should be done with all these Zynga apps being preinstalled. However, it takes 10 minutes or so to uninstall them. I can't knock it because of this.Let me be clear; this phone is the way to go. We are at an amazing point for smartphones; why not really care about something you use most of the day? We go to work on our phones, we attend class on our phones, and we consume most, if not all, of our entertainment on our phones; go with something that works for you. This phone does for me to an almost fervent degree.",2020年10月9日 在美国审核

Some pros &amp; cons when upgrading from S9 to S20 FE,"I took advantage of the T-mobile trade-in program to upgrade my aging early 2018 Samsung S9 64GB to this new late 2020 Samsung S20 FE 128GB which allowed me to get this phone for $200 + taxes. Overall, it's a very good phone for the price even without trade-in, but there are some pros &amp; cons which I'm going to lay out below.*** Pros:- Price / Affordability. Obviously this is the biggest pro of the S20 FE as you can upgrade to one of the newest phones from samsung for not too much without having to shell 1000 dollars or more.- The S20 FE has 6GB of RAM which is an upgrade over the S9's 4GB of RAM. Although looking at my Android's settings Device Care info, I seem to see a larger RAM usage for the S20 FE (around 3.4GB usage without any apps open which leaves about 2.6GB available when idle, versus around 2GB of available space when idle for the S9. So you gain a little but not as much as expected. This may be due to the new upgraded Snapdragon 865 processor being more memory hungry than the outdated processor on the S9.- The S20 FE has 128GB of onboard drive space which is twice as much as the S9. So this is def a big plus. Also you can add up to 1TB of SDXC memory.- The Cameras are much better on the S20 FE than my old S9, no doubt. You benefit from the 3 camera setup with good performing lenses on the 0.5x, 1x and 3x lenses. As a professional in the photo/video business, it's very welcome and you will be happy with the S20 FE's camera performance overall. The selfie camera also is a big improvement over the S9.- The Fingerprint sensor placement is much better at the front of the handset below the display. A big improvement over the S9 which was at the back of the phone.*** Tie- In terms of overall performance and daily usage, I would say you get about the same performance as the S9. You won't notice that the S20 FE is snappier or slower than the S9 for most apps used. Browsing feels about the same, even though the S20 FE touts the 120Hz display, but has a lower pixel density in terms of screen resolution. Colorwise, they are about the same in terms of vivid colors or contrast/brightness.- In terms of battery life, I see to get about the same performance as my S9, even though the S20 FE touts a larger battery, but also has a bigger display so it evens out.- In terms of 5G performance, I tested it in a few places and I don't see much improvements in terms of Upload or Download performance over 4G LTE. It's very uneven depending on where you are. On T-mobile, I get about 40Mb/s to 90Mb/s downlink with 5G vs 50Mb/s to 75Mb/s with 4G downlink. and around 25Mb/s uplink for 5G and 4G similarly when I'm in a good area. So I decided to just switch back from 5G to 4G LTE settings on my android phone, so meh... as far as 5G is concerned... maybe this will improve over time.*** Cons:- My biggest con is the S20 FE definitely feels heavier and is much larger to hold than the S9. It is about the size of the S20+ and I wished they kept the width of the S9/S10/S20 so that one-handed usage is much easier. With a protective case added to the S20 FE, you will be hard pressed to use this phone one-handed unless you have big hands. I don't unfortunately. After all, they called it the S20 Fan Edition, so why make it so much larger? Samsung could have made the S20 FE taller but kept the S20 width... Food for thought for later iterations! Please keep this in mind Samsung. Not everyone wants a larger screen at the cost of having to use 2 hands all the time.- As others have said, why did they put the volume buttons on the right hand side? Why not keep these buttons on the left hand side? Probably because it's a two-handed device, so they thought, might as well have everything on one side so you operate it with your thumb... Poor design/UX in my opinion.- Loss of the 3.5mm phone jack. Alas this is becoming standard on most higher end phones from Samsung/Google/Apple... Sad... Now you have to use a dongle and can't charge &amp; listen to music with a wired headset at the same time unless you buy another heavier dongle with those 2 ports (USB-C &amp; 3.5mm) which may or may not work seamlessly... I decided to buy the Samsung 3.5mm to USB-C dongle because there doesn't seem to be a dual port dongle that works perfectly yet. And I don't like using bluetooth all the time with a wireless headset.- It's still early for the release of this phone, so you won't get many good covers &amp; screen protectors alas... I bought a clear cover from T-mobile TO-GO branded, and so far it is just too bulky &amp; uncomfortable of a cover and way more expensive than on Amazon. But the covers on amazon are not yet shipping... Something to bear in mind as you will pay 2x or 3x more via T-mobile to get those accessories right away.- One last small pet peeve, is the loss of the kind of clean wallpapers I had with the S9, now you get those flowery preloaded wallpapers that are just not UI friendly, they are too bright and busy so your icons &amp; Time/Date don't separate nicely from the wallpaper background... You gotta download themes/wallpapers from the Samsung Store to get some equivalent ones... but not exactly the same as S9 which were so nice.So in Summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G offers a nice cost effective way to upgrade your aging android phone that's say 2-years old or more... like it did for me with my former S9. You gain in RAM, drive space, and a larger display, but you lose in terms of one-handed usage and a heavier phone to hold, carry around, and larger to slip in your pockets, and no more 3.5mm headphone jack... sigh. There isn't much improvement in terms of performance, operability, or battery life over the S9, but at least you know that this S20 FE is close to being the latest and greatest from Samsungfor the next couple years until you upgrade again to another iteration... For me, it's a 4/5 star phone and is worth the upgrade from the S9 still but I'm missing my S9 already because it was so good at doing most everything with just one hand... now I gotta use 2 hands with this phone most of the time... but at least I have enough onboard fast memory space with 128GB which will allow me to add more apps/take more photos/videos when the apps need the speed of onboard memory to take the photo shot.",2020年10月5日 在美国审核

Doesn't get much better than this!,"I currently have a Galaxy Note 10 and before that the Pixel 3.The Note 20 has been great but I've been wanting to upgrade to something with a better battery.I've tried the Note 20 Ultra (too big and bulky) and the Note 20 (not worth $999 or even $799) and finally arrived at the S20 FE.So far, the battery life has been great with 6-7 hours screen on time.Compared to the Note line and pretty much everything else in the marketplace right now, this is a fantastic device at this price point.The screen is as good as the Note 20 line with its great color accuracy, sharpness and bright screen.While it doesn't have WQHD+ like the Note 20 Ultra, it does have 120hz which the Note 20 doesn't.So if you're running 120hz, you can't use WQHD+ anyway.This device also has a fantastic camera system that takes better shots than the Note 20.I've compared them side by side and the S20 FE delivers more vibrant and sharper images.While the telephoto is only 8MP, it didn't seem to effect the quality and outputs pictures that were just as good as the Note 20.The Note 20 Ultra has an amazing telephoto, so if that's important to you, then go for it, but costing about $500 more than this device, seems not worth it.If you're a Pixel user, One UI is an adjustment but I actually enjoy it with all the options it brings. Unlike past Samsung devices, their OS doesn't slow things down in the least and this phone is as fast as the Note 20's that I also tried out.Samsung has also been great about doing monthly updates and will be giving 3 years OS support on the S20 FEI do wish it came with 8GB instead of 6 but I haven't noticed any performance issues as a result - the device feels just as fast and fluid as the other more expensive phones I tried with much more RAM.Perhaps if you're a gamer or heavy multi-tasker, this might be a bigger factor to consider in your decision to buy this device.I've seen comments about the finger print scanner being unreliable but I haven't experienced that at all.In fact, it's been much more reliable and way faster than sonic ones in the newer Note 20 devices I tried.If you're considering this over the Pixel 5, the S20 FE seems the better value with better CPU, 120hz screen and more versatile camera system (but the Pixel will undoubtedly take better pictures as its the camera king!), expandable storage, bigger battery and faster charging.If you're considering this over the Note 20 (standard not Ultra), the S20 FE is a much better value for less money giving you 120hz screen, expandable storage and better camera.Unfortunately you lose out on the S-Pen with the S20 FE, but if you can go without, then the S20 FE is a much bigger bang for your buck.At the end of the day, I think this phone is a superb value at $599 and the best you can get at this price point.",2020年10月7日 在美国审核

unsettling,"Enjoy the always-on OLED with punch hole.Just peek at the phone and you know the time &amp; notifications.Always-on is the best feature.Perfectly happy with the styling and performance.Wish the battery could be user accessible-but that is a personal opinion.I was prepared to purchase a 25W charger, but after experiencing the bundled 15W, I sense that 5V 3A is nice balance between faster and cooler operation that will probably prolong the working life of the battery.Similarly for the Qi wireless charging which is naturally inefficient and runs even hotter.I am shopping for aftermarket chargers, but no hurry.The set of bundled apps is unsettling and in need of attention.A first clue was when ""calendar"" did not sync properly.Turns out that Samsung has an entire set of unbranded applications spoofing basic Google apps including:phone, calendar, contacts, my files, clock, gallery, messages, and more.What is unsettling is that these Samsung apps are UNBRANDED presumably to lull consumers into believing they are Google branded apps.It seems this required many gatekeeper failures including but not limited to:Google App certification approved a set of""unbranded"" apps to exist.The trickery continues with unbranded notifications with no explicit indication which app is requesting access to personal information.For example, is enabling ""Find My Phone"" a prompt from Samsung, Google, the data provider, and/or some other entity?There are also unbranded notifications that appear from hidden Apps that are not readily located such as ""Carrier Hub"".[Try to find that in my apps.]The many overlapping and redundant requests for permissions to parse messages, mail, files, locations, settings, behavior, calls, logs, sounds, videos,swipes and keystrokes because concerningly invasive when the asking party is anonymous.Some permissions such as Bixby cannot be changed.Another sloppy mistake was a terms and conditions click to agree screen that was missing the actual terms and conditions statements.Surely the EU, California CCPA, and other laws prohibit such deception.The out of the box experience can be daunting.Many steps and ""insider knowledge"" are required just to turn on and configure the phone.Setup can be never-ending.Each time you want to turn on the phone:you have to pick up the phone, tap twice, wait for facial recognition to fail, swipe up, enter password, swipe up to get to a home button, hit home, then navigate to where you want to be.Shipping an obsolete version of Android is disappointing and let's just say there is some opportunity for software updates to improve.A minor tip:The sim tool is hidden in a secret compartment of the retail box.For my experience, the retail box is tight fitting.After removing the top cover, it is very easy to miss a secret compartment stuck inside the top cover containing the pin used to pop open the sim slot.There was a white piece of blank paper that made it appear to have a false top.The useless instructions also happen to be in that compartment.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – 18 Months Later,"The S20FE, redefined what it meant to be a budget flagship, and a premium mid-range device. Still, nearly 2 years later the value is still ever present. The device has been my daily driver since October of 2020, and this is my take on the handset. Keep in mind, this device launched at $700, I only paid 450$ with device trade in. Let’s go over the basic specs:- Snapdragon 865 CPU- 6GB RAM/128GB ROM or 8GB RAM/256GB ROM- Wifi 6- 5G- 6.5 inch AMOLED display- Under-Display fingerprint sensor- 4500 MAH battery- Gorilla Glass 3 on the front display.Pros:- All-Day battery life. As the strange advertisements suggested this device can get me through a day of moderate to heavy usage. My usage time is upwards of 8 hours on some days. It doesn’t perform as well as when I first got it but it does still last all day, easily.- Display. The AMOLED display is sharp, crisp, and extra smooth with 120Hz mode enabled. It is great for content consumption.- Software. One UI on top of Android is not for everyone. Samsung has a distinct flavor that isn’t stock. But, Goodlock from Samsung puts the power in my hands to change most things like colors, icons, etc. The customization is crucial for me so I don’t mind One UI’s more questionable styling choice because of its flexibility. Plus, 4 years of software updates is always something to appreciate from an android handset. Google is the next closest competitor to this standard.- Rear Camera. The back 3 cameras have been everyday champions at capturing the moments that I want to share with my friends and family. The newest iPhone’s will certainly beat this device especially in night photography, but overall its pictures are sharp, colorful (maybe a bit saturated), and high quality. Video too has been great and the camera app has useful tools to make pictures and videos even more special.Cons:- Gorilla Glass 3. Being a daily driver, this device has been everywhere with me. My last device, the galaxy s8 had Gorilla Glass 5. I am not super clumsy, but I have been known to drop my phone occasionally. I had been lucky for the first 12 months to not have any cracks, but my screen did get a crack across the middle after a 4ft drop from my waist as I was putting things into my car. So, keep a screen protector on this device if you are prone to the occasional drop or two. Gorilla Glass 3 is super scratch resistant, but it couldn’t stand the drop.- Size. This one is super dependent on who you are as a person and how your hands are. I have hands that are on the smaller side. The galaxy s8 was the perfect size. Coming to this phone which was taller and wider proved at first to be a bit of a challenge. I can’t stress just how large this phone is compared to a standard iPhone. The device was comfortable to hold but my small hands would sometimes drown in the sheer size of it all. But, This is entirely like, a me problem haha.- Front Camera/Facial Recognition: the front camera is a little disappointing. For me, I hated the small metal rim on the display. It ruined the bezel-less clean look for me sometimes. But, especially with facial recognition. It isn’t any kind of fancy 3D scanning IR like apple uses, its just 2D facial scanning. Which isn’t great. You can register a face, but it isn’t reliable in any sense and it just doesn’t hold the bar.Odds and Ends:- Touch Sensitivity: When the device first came out in 2020 there were reports of touch sensitivity problems and instances of ghost touches. My device had this issue at first but then a software update and calibration did fix my issue of touch sensitivity. I haven’t had any issues since. But on release, it was a bit rough. I think though, the software update fixed this issue for most individuals- Under-Display Fingerprint Sensor: This device comes with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display which is kind of futuristic. But it can be hit or miss. For me, after a few software updates it is almost always pretty solid and consistent. There are times when my finger is on the display at a weird angle, and it won’t unlock but it is fast and mostly reliable. It is not as fast as rear-mounted scanners like on the Galaxy S8 and S9 series. But it has gotten better since release. Now, it should be a pretty okay experience to use.Overall, this device has been an amazing value for me over these past 18 months. It has gotten 2 software updates so far, and they still have 2 more to receive. The device should get up to android 14 according to Samsung’s 4 years of support. So, it still has lots of life left in it, and anyone considering this in 2022 should still buy this device. It is not the newest device, but it is solid in terms of its performance and value.",2022年5月15日 在美国审核
Great with a few flaws,"I wanted to love this phone. It's flat display with a highend chipset and good cameras is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it has a few small flaws that will have me returning it.1. 6gb of ram, not the end of the world. But, it does hold back the 865 from performing as well as it can. Again not a huge deal, but I felt I should mention it.2. Too dim of a screen, this is the killer for me. No matter if on automatic brightness or not. The maximum screen brightness is too dim for me in outdoor scenarios and the screen washes out too easily. This is the reason I feel like I have to return this phone.Too be fair, if you don't need or use your phone in outdoor lighting, this thing is great otherwise.",2020年10月6日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price,"For $600, I would say this is a pretty good phone for the price. I have had mine for a week now and am pretty satisfied. Coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy Note 8, this is a good upgrade. You can check out the specs on any Samsung's page, so I'm just going to list my personal pros and cons. Most of my cons are relatively minor when taking into account the phone is $600 new.Pros:Price - $600 new is a great price. The only other phone I was considering was the Google Pixel 5, which is $100 more.Battery life - The S20 FE lasts a full day easily even with 120hz turned on. Coming from a phone with a 3-year old battery that was struggling to make it the full day, this is a big plus for me.Back cameras - The back cameras are a big upgrade from my previous Note 8. The Note 8 was fine if there was enough light, but as soon as things got darker, photos went downhill. The photos I have taken so far on the S20 FE look great.120hz - Scrolling and animations are very smooth. I don't play any games on my phone other than Genshin Impact or TFT once in a while, so this was a nice plus rather than a must have for me.MicroSD card slot - I store all my photos on my SD card, so the S20 FE having a slot for that is nice.Flat screen - As someone who quickly got annoyed with the curved edges on my old Note 8 rendering it unusable without a case, the S20 FE's flat screen is a nice change.AOD - The always-on display was one of my favorite features of my Note 8 so glad to see it's still around.Size - I love big phones, and I love big screens even more. The 6.5-inch display is great, and the phone is about the same size as my Note 8, which has a smaller display. I have long fingers, so I don't have much issue using the phone.Cons:No headphone jack - By far my biggest complaint with the S20 FE is the lack of a headphone jack. I don't see why it's necessary to exclude the jack on Samsung's newer phones. Seems like a ploy to get consumers to buy their overpriced wireless earbuds. I had to buy some dongles on Amazon so I could use my existing headphones.Front camera quality - While the back cameras are impressive, the front camera is less so. The selfies I took with my girlfriend were kind of washed out and overly smooth. The 32mp photos don't look any better than the 8mp ones from my Note 8.Touchscreen issues - I have had touchscreen issues where instead of scrolling the screen will randomly register it as clicks instead. Most noticeable on Instragram where it'll click on random profiles instead of scrolling. So far, it looks like restarting the phone fixes these issues for a few days. Hopefully Samsung fixes this with a software update.Buttons - I am fine with Samsung moving the volume buttons to the right side. However, Samsung should have considered adding additional buttons to the left because now there isn't anything there. A do-not-disturb slider or a dedicated camera button would have been nice.Overall, I would recommend this phone for anyone upgrading. For $600, you get a great phone.Edit - July 2021 Update:Been using the same phone still since September of 2020. I saw this phone was on sale for $479 a couple weeks ago for Amazon's Prime Day. This phone is a no brainer at that price. The touchscreen issues were all resolved with a few software updates late last year. I have not encountered any touchscreen issues since then and don't have any further complaints in the past year. Battery life still lasts a full work day from 7am to midnight with around 25-30% battery life left.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核
Great Phone for the price,"Love the phone ,Not crazy about the buttons on one side because of the screenshot process,will get use to it.I used the S20 FE all day, more than usual, to see how the batterylife was and to me it was great.I upgraded from the Galaxy S9 because I was tired of constantly charging it.Do wish Samsung wouldgive the ok to have Otterbox and other companies have cases available when the phone is ordered.Well worth the money, did not want to spenda fortune for the S20.",2020年10月8日 在美国审核
Best big phone value out there,"If you want a big phone with state of the art features, the S20FE really has no competition.It does pretty much everything the more expensive S20 phones do at a much much lower price point. And if you have a decent phone to trade in (go the Samsung site for more details), it is practically a a steal. I traded S10e and got this one for $285.Hard to beat.There are few minor difference from the more expensive siblings, like a glass vs plastic back and a 10X vs 3X optical zoom. The screen res is bit lower on the FE but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference. It is great screen. Oh, and no millimeter 5G, just the low end version of 5G,which is all that exists now anyway in 95 percent of the US. And a lot of places don't even have that yet.If you can live with those minor shortcomings, this is the phone for you. Also be aware this phone is actually bigger than the S20 and almost as big as the plus.The super fast 120 refresh rate is a big selling point. Something almost no other phone, beyond the S20 lineup, has.Makes scrolling super smooth and fast. Stereo speakers sound better than most phones. Wifi 6 support. In screen finger printer reader works well.But also has face recognition unlock. Infinitely customizable, as most of Samsung's high end phones are.There are only a few downsides. It comes with a low end, regular than fast charger.But if you have an older Samsung phone with fast charger, itwill work here.Some idiot decided to do away with a simple power button. You have to press volume AND the Bixby button to turn if on or off. Insane.You can change that in the settings and make the Bixby button the power button (which should have been the default).Bixby (digital assistant) is a major pain in the butt, but you can drive a stake through its heart and get rid of it completelywith some effort.Google it.Many different settings must be changed.Overall, this is the best phone for the money I have seen in a long time.Don't bother with anything else if you want a state of the art phone.",2020年11月13日 在美国审核
Its nice,"I was skeptical about buying this phone since I was always a huawei/apple user. I got tired of apple because of the storage and my huawei phone no longer supports google due to the ban so I figured I picked up this phone despite the reviews. It is really nice. The fingerprint works well and the battery life and touch screen is nice. The screen is moderately big and it includes a microSD card for additional storage. Camera quality is decent. Its better than the iphone, but not better than the huawei one. The volume is 10x better than my iphone. Overall, for the fan edition its nice and at a decent price. It has everything a s20 has so I cant complain.",2020年11月10日 在美国审核

Plus the screen is AMAZING. LED 120hz it is very smooth and fast. The downside is the OS. APPLE has android beat hands down for OS smoothness, screen sensitivity (I am often cought touching the sides of the phone screen and clicking when I wasn't trying too on samsung.) Being 23 years old I can learn to navigate android but APPLE IS BETTER FOR 40+ years old! Next year will be switching to iphone 13 but battery life is good OS just needs simplification.",2020年10月8日 在美国审核
Great phone at a great price.,"Update#2: The reason you want to buy the Fan Edition of Samsung Galaxy phones is because you can use the Samsung DEX app. If you don't use the app than any android phone will work fine. But with the Samsung DEX app it makes all the difference. only the S phones are supported on the DEX app. Although the A series supports Windows Link. It's garbage compare to the DEX app.<br>Update: been using it daily for 3 months now. All the accessories for this phone is cheaper than the rest of the S20 lineup except the battery. The battery for this month is 3~5X more than other Samsung phones. Makes it expensive to repair, like if Samsung doesn't want you to replace it.So far I thought the FE 5G is a pretty good phone.You get the camera app of the s20 ultra.Pro camera settings you can only find on high end cameras.Dolby Atoms audio.Micro SD memory slot.yep it's a option that's missing on the S21s.Some minor issues.Bluetooth audio device missing battery % indicators.</br>",2021年2月9日 在美国审核
Good phone,"I got mine through ATT. I haven’t had any problems or issues. I use the Google Assistant a lot, and it’s better than Siri on my iPad. It brings up the results pretty fast and is usually accurate. This is really important to me. Battery lasts a long time, I can be on long conversations during the day and still have plenty of battery. It’s a large screen, which I like, especially having small screens in the past. But it’s smaller from side to side, and it’s perfect for me even though I have smaller hands. My photos are pretty good, I’m happy with them, and you scale it to way up close.This is a really good phone in my opinion. However, the best phone I’ve had is an Alcatel 3V, but they don’t make them anymore. The best battery life is Nokia, but that was when you couldn’t access the internet",2022年1月1日 在美国审核
Great phone,"I'm not a gamer with new toy. First thing was to disable/uninstall before temptation sets in. By doing so and using this phone for calls, messages, browsing, photos it is now been a 10 hour day and I still have 85%. The hardest part has-been finding a solution to butt calls to 911. Solved. No lock screen. Not worried as phone is with me. All accounts password protected. All apps are in folders so no problem there. Except I then had to disable ""gestures"" because of all the screens hots while in pocket. Bixby keeps coming on all by itself but somewhere I did see a remove Bixby button.Must have been once in a lifetime shot. Can't find it again. I think it is in a privacy setting. Pictures are good but honestly my old note 3 can compete. I had used fingerprint which works great but it brings back the chance of 911 calls. They should reconfigure the 911 button to bring up a dialer with just 3 numbers 091, then you can call 911 or operator. I got a case from caselogic and the plate charger has no problem. Also disable the phone suggesting stuff to me. Too stupid. These guys think I bought a traveling billboard. IT IS A PHONE. It would be sad to be addicted to a gamer, kill the battery and not be able to call for help.",2021年4月16日 在美国审核
Overall good phone for the price but has some issues.,"I switched from Motorola to Samsung after my Z3 started dying after mere months of use. There is no way I will ever pay a thousand dollars for a phone that will be obsolete within 2-3 years. That's just not going to happen. The S20FE seemed to have 90 percent of the features of the S20 at a reasonable price so I got it. It's definitely better in most ways than the Motorola and I'm happy with it so far.One thing to be aware of as soon as you power up is that stupid 120 Hz setting - turn it OFF immediately unless you want your battery dying in a couple of hours. It's really useless for most tasks and it's activated by default, which is why everyone is complaining about poor battery life. At 60 Hz my battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.I got the 128 Gb version with 6 Gb ram from my Verizon store since I already had an account and they gave additional discounts for immediate activation. I then added my 128 Gb micro sd card so I should finally have enough storage and app space to breathe for awhile. The phone will accept up to 1 Tb cards.Screen brightness is disappointing. It's only half as bright as my $49 Samsung J3 I use to fly my drones. In fact it's only about the same brightness as my old Motorola. Not good in sunlight. Not happy about this at all. The little J3 will sear your eyes in daylight with boost mode! WTF? Why?!Another major flaw is the absurdly slippery case, which constantly tries to squirt out of my pocket or hands every time I touch it. I dropped it three times while waiting for my Spigen Rugged Armor case to arrive. All those nice colors this phone comes in are pointless since you are absolutely going to drop this phone at some point without a good case to cover all the slippery surfaces. Not MIGHT drop it - you WILL drop it. It's that hard to hold onto. I also contrasted this with my trusty J3. Again, the FE loses, since the J3 has an absolutely perfect tactile surface that was designed to be held, not dropped. The J3 surface is so perfectly designed I didn't want to cover it with a case - and I have NEVER dropped it! Again I have to ask - W.T.F.??? was Samsung thinking when they designed this S20FE phone?So the camera is very good for a phone camera. In fact it's better than some of my actual cameras. I experimented with photo, video, single take, slo-mo, and was very impressed with the quality I get without much effort. The 3x optical zoom I really like. It also digitally zooms to 30x in photo and 12x in video mode. I handheld full zoom with image stabilization and got surprisingly sharp results. I really like this camera. I useLapse It Pro when I want to take high quality time lapses so I didn't spend much time with the built in version but it seemed to do ok. There are very few adjustments on those modes.Bluetooth connects very well to my speakers at high quality. Also to my fitness band. Wifi is decent as well. Where this phone is a notch above my old Motorolas is in signal sensitivity. It picks up cellular signals in places my Droids were just dead. Like in an industrial building basement with lots of concrete and steel. I still had a data connection (slow) and could text.Headphones are questionable at the moment. My USB-c adapter doesn't work with this phone. I get an error saying it's not supported. Nothing at all about wired headphones in the manual. So I ordered Bluetooth buds (NOT Galaxy - since they pulled this cheap stunt I will not reward them) I ordered the TOZO T10 and will update whenI test them.Phone call quality is solidly above average but not great. Another feature that is actually better on my bottom of the line J3 phone!Overall, this phone is a good upper mid level option for those tired of the cheap $150 phones and don't want to spend a fortune on the latest gadget.",2020年10月17日 在美国审核
"An expensive, so, so phone","On paper the phone looks great. But coming from an S9, I wish I would not have purchased the S20FE. The virtual proximity sensor is awful. 8 times out of 10, it will inactivate the phone if it's against your ear. But 2/10 times it will not and if you are moving around while on the phone, you will dial other people, hang up, put the call on hold - you name it. The LED notifications are gone and replaced with on screen notifications. First thing I noticed was the charging screen notification, nothing will burn in a screen like repetitive text. The fingerprint scanner is worse than prior versions - again the S9, was far more advanced. The Gorilla glass 3 will be less impact resistant than the 5 used on other phones. The glass has an odd cheap feel, like I have plastic on it, but I don't. The camera produces ok shots, but all need some touchups when I get home. Either over exposed or too much contrast... Selphies are also pretty bad, the fixed focus just doesn't do a good job. Then there are the screen problems. I haven't quite figured this out, but I get ghost touches and ignored touches. Playing with the sensitivity does not resolve the issue.If you, like me spend a lot of time on the phone, you better get a headset, as using this phone, as a phone will result in hangups and all sorts of issues because of the crappy proximity sensor.I tested the Wifi compared to my wife's S9 and the S9 would consistently get &gt; 120Mbs, the S20FE was averaging just over 100Mbs. Used the same SSID and was in the exact location. So the S20FE loses the battle against the S9 in terms of screen quality and scratch resistance, fingerprint scanning, proximity sensor, typing accuracy and wifi speed. Pretty bad that a 2 year old phone is better than a brand new one.",2020年10月20日 在美国审核
"So-so responsive screen, but overall a good phone","Coming from Pixel 3a, S20 FE does feel like an upgrade. It's not mind-blowing, but I can see myself using this phone for quite some time before the next flagship. One big reason for the upgrade was 5G. To be honest, I can't quite tell the difference between 5G vs 4G LTE that I've been using... Still, I don't regret my purchase and going to keep using S20 FE.Pros:+ Look of the back: I really like the orange color and the matted texture. I really do. It just fits me.+ 120 Hz screen speed: it makes for a smoother scrolling when I'm reading the news or e-mail. However, it does eat up battery life+ Camera zoom: The range is 0.5x - 30x, which is more than what was possible in 3a.+ 128GB internal storage: plenty for me, a regular phone user to take pics and videos. There's an option to use a microSD, too, for additional storage.*Side bar: this is a useful feature of Samsung phones. A shortcut. Makes it easier to keep my screen looking clean and organized.*Spotify 6-mo Premium: I bought the phone from Samsung directly and it came with Spotify for 6 months.*Samsung Smart Switch App: made it easy to port data from 3a to FE.*Water-resistant: for Pacific Northwest, this is a must...So-so:*Camera:The camera features other bells and whistles like slow mo, hyperlapse, super slow-mo, and even food mode for social media. The camera is catered to social media for sure. FE has night vision, but tbh, 3a had better night vision mode. It's not the worst, but it's not the best.* Battery life: 3a had better battery, but play with the power mode, this phone can last a while. With heavy use, this phone will die on you fast on High Performance or Optimized. Can last you a day under medium power or light use. I had this phone go without a charge on a weekend camping trip, and was able to make it last by placing it on maximum power saving. Based on usage, the battery can last, just not past a day...*Screen (videos and pictures): it looks great. Colors do look a bit saturated when I took pictures with it. There are options to change to a more natural look, but default is the saturated look. Youtube, Netflix... Streaming is fine.Cons:* Bloatware and features: Coming from Google Pixel 3a, this phone comes with a lot of features right off the bat. Samsung proprietary apps do feel like bloatware, but not all of them are throwaways. Few are useful.* Screen (responsiveness): it falls short. Randomly, the screen becomes unresponsive to where my finger is. That makes it hard to unlock my phone. The phone becomes frustrating at random times because I can't unlock the phone or open an app.*Updates: no Android 11 yet...*Size:... it's big. It feels more like a tablet than a phone in my hands after a while. There is a one-handed mode, but ... the physical size is still big. At least, with such a mode, I don't have to stretch my thumb or fingers for too long. It's annoying though.Despite the shortcomings, for some reason, FE fits and gels with my needs for a phone. I can see myself using for 3 - 5 years. Even with S21 coming out, I think I'll stick with FE for a while until the next upgrade.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核

Mediocre Phone,"I am offering this review after owning the Galaxy S10E for about 1 year.I got this phone after I dropped my Moto X in water and I chose the Galaxy because I have a Galaxy watch and they two are supposed to work best together.I don't particularly have any complaints about the phone, it makes and receives calls. Runs the Android Apps that I find essential.It has reasonable storage.The Moto X have functions to turn on the flashlight (shake the phone) and camera (twist the phone) that I still missIn fact, when I DO need the flashlight, I find it very cumbersome to turn on as it is a button on the pull-down settings menu.THe Galaxy has a power share function so I should be able to charge my Galaxy watch from the phone.This does work, however, you have to lay the watch on the BACK of the phone - perfectly centered and STILL.I've had the phone in an Otterbox case the whole time I've had it and when I did need this powershare function, I had to take the phone out of the case.The screen got scratched all to pieces the one time I tried to do this - when I went on a short trip and forgot my watch charger.So, I wouldn't recommend using that function unless you can closely control the environment and ensure the phone doesn't get bumped and is laying on a soft and very clean surface.It is a small phone - I don't have complaints about the screen per se, but when I hold it out of the case I feel like it might slip through my hands easily.I have dropped it a number of times - in that Otterbox case - and it has never cracked or failed in any way.I've mentioned the case a couple of times so I do want to make a disclaimer - I won't buy another Otter Box case - it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty and the corner of it is broken off...I did say that I've dropped the phone, but that corner fell off at the strangest time - in fact, I got into my car and there was a piece of blue plastic lying on my black seat after looking all around, I realized it had come off my phone case. When I contacted the manufacturer they asked me to pay them $6 or $8 to ship a new one.That doesn't seem like much of a warranty to me.Regarding the interaction with the Galaxy watch:The Wear app doesn't do much.It will help you find the watch if it's lost in the house. Mostly it offers you about a million different watch faces - there's a whole section of the app dedicated to the watch face.As far as functionality, it's very hard to find apps for the watch thru that app.",2020年10月12日 在美国审核

Returning this to Samsung,"I purchased this unlocked directly from Samsung.I had this phone for about a week and the transfer and setup process using the Samsung Switch app was so bad that most of my apps didn't get downloaded. Instead there is an app icon that launches a web browser. Seriously Samsung, this is pretty basic stuff.The software also doesn't transfer account information and app specific settings unless you're transferring from another Samsung device. Not a good strategy to get customers from other manufacturers to switch to their products.The fingerprint reader is terrible and it sometimes it takes 5 - 6 tries to get it to work.Pictures are blurry.Lots of Samsung bloatware loaded on the phone constantly asking you to login to your Samsung account.Sending this back to Samsung and will be looking at other phones. Maybe a OnePlus 8T which is comparable, but comes with more storage and memory - 256Gb and 12Gb RAM.",2020年10月28日 在美国审核
"I really like this phone, with one exception","I really like this phone. It has great clarity, speed and good quality cameras. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have an LED notification of emails, texts or calls.I know this is a bit trivial, but it is something I really miss and wish this new F20 fe 5g had. I've seen some apps that provide this notification, but they require very intrusive information gathering requirements, which I don't want either.....The trusted places feature on my old s6 rarely worked, and the same holds true on this new s20 fe, it rarely unlocks my phone automatically when I'm at my trusted place. On the plus side, the fingerprint feature never worked on my old s6, it seems to work about 95% of the time on the s20 fe.I have not tried the face recognition feature as of yet, so I can't comment on how well that works or doesn't. The battery life seems to be about 50% better then my old s6. I'm not a constant user of the phone like some are, so I can go two and half days between charges.This is a really nice phone and I'm glad I upgraded from my old s6, but I can't understand why they gave up the LED notification feature.",2020年12月5日 在美国审核
a lot of problems.,"This phone achieves two really good goals, it's an amazing phone and really good value for money. You get a lot of great features and specs that are usually found in more expensive phones for the budget price. It's fast, very smooth and responsive, great camera. The plastic back might not impress some but for me it's VERY acceptable sacrifice for the lower price, I use case anyway and it's better than having glass. You just can't get a better phone for this price.UPDATE: well, things went south fast. This phone seemed great first couple of weeks but then it started showing problems. The brightness ALWAYS acting up, even after disabling adaptive brightness, when I am in direct sunlight outside it DIMS and I can barely see. The phone freezes and gotten very slow. Also every software update seems to make it worse, mostly recent update (3/26/2021) caused several apps like weather app to glitch. It's just so much trouble.

And the finger print sensor might take two trys sometimes. The camera is amazing, the battery life is even better. Charge time is quick, I had a note 9 before this and I am very pleased.

This phone is not for the busy professional,"When you look at texts you have to push another prompt to be able to call the individual who texted you. Why not just push phone?Maybe not a big if you have time but if you need to make 3/4 calls in 5 10 minutes it is. The playback button is right next to the call back. If your in a hurry and busy that causes issues because, and maybe it's just me but sometimes I push the call back and have to hang up or talk to someone when I'm pinched for time. Another issue, that I had with my S10 when you push phone massages I keep getting texts massages. WTH! Only way I can get to my phone message is by restart which is more time intensive than the S10.The people who designed this have no idea how busy a professional can be between clients, customers.

Great phone but horrible warranty,"Phone has worked great for me. It is annoying how big it is but I am slowly getting used to it. I bought it for the large battery and it has worked out great for me. I only really have to charge it once a day unless I am watching videos then maybe twice. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because after 10 months of having it my power on/off button on the side fell out. I have not been ruff with the phone. I haven't dropped it in liquid(s) or on hard surfaces. It just fell out from normal use, phone calls, texts, and watching videos. So far samsung doesn't seem to helpful and it sounds like this is an issue with the phone model, along with the volume button falling out. Hopefully that doesn't happen for me soon. Samsung said that it isn't covered under the warranty and only software issues are covered under the warranty.

The fourth one is Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G, about 10 months, the WiFi cannot turn on. I went to a repair spot authorized by Samsung two times in a month, then they said they can’t fix it, need change the mainboard, no values for repairing. I have to contact Samsung.

"Buttons Fall Off, Samsung Customer Support Unhelpful","I purchased this phone from Amazon in November 2020.In most ways it's an excellent product.However after 6 months of routine use the POWER button fell out of the phone.I searched online and discovered this was a common problem, but I imagined it would be a simple repairI brought the phone to a Samsung Authorized Service Center which told me that:1) Loss of the POWER button was considered “cosmetic” damage by Samsung and would not be covered under the 1 year warranty2) The POWER button is integrated with the display and cannot be replaced independently.So in order to fix the button I would have to pay for a new screen.I phoned Samsung customer service and they repeated the same explanation, but offered that I had the option of bringing the phone to a Samsung owned service center (a 90 minute drive each way) where they would inspect the phone and if the loss of the button was deemed a manufacturing problem then the replacement would be free.Otherwise I would have face the same charge for screen replacement and I would have wasted half a day getting there and back.It's extremely disappointing that the only frequently used moving parts on this otherwise fine product are engineered with such flimsy plastic.It's extremely disappointing that Samsung does not accept any responsibility for the design problem.Any customers who buy the phone based on its otherwise good performance and value should exercise great care when pressing the POWER and VOLUME buttons to avoid unwelcome repair expense.",2021年6月21日 在美国审核

(4) I had to turn off Auto Captitalize because it was capitalizing 3 or 4 words in the middle of every sentence. (5) It repeats text! Once it repeated 3 lines of text 15 times. (6) The cursor is not stationary. It jumps up and types in the middle of a prior sentence. Or if editing somewhere, the cursor jumps down and starts typing in the middle of another sentence. (7) I have problems with the simple task of copying and pasting! Won't work sometimes unless I type 1 letter 1st, then the Copy option will appear. And, in reverse, many times I get no Paste option unless I type in 1 letter 1st. (8) It is always inserting multiple words I didn't even say that I have to erase.(9) WORST, is their Contacts app. Yellow head,white shoulders and an orange background.

Follows the worst iPhone trends,"First things first:it has no headphone jack.Every phone should have a headphone jack.Leaving this out was an extremely stupid decision when Apple made it, and an even dumber one when Samsung followed their lead.If you're going to use a phone in public (as most cellphone users do sometimes!), it's a pretty basic piece of functionality to be able to do that without disturbing those around you.The official line is that leaving it out left room for a bigger battery, but there's a huge amount of space taken up by the multiple cameras.Leaving one of those off would have left enough room to include a jack.The description says it ""charges in minutes"", and technically that's true; 200 is a number of minutes.My S8 Active that the back has almost fallen off charges faster.It's at least easy to set the side button to do something useful now, instead of summoning Bixby; that saves it from a 1-star review.But Bixby is still there, trying to insert itself into tasks that Google's own tools are already doing better.",2021年9月1日 在美国审核

Terrible glass,"The phone itself is pretty good, but the glass they use on it is terrible. Try to find what they use, good luck. Corning doesn't list this model as using their glass.

Cheapest replacement glass, no listed version of what they use, and it breaks after a laughably minor fall = bad glass. Do not buy this phone.

Overall it Delivers!  If you are ok with screen,"i had the following questions:1. would it really be new out of the box?2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?The answers:1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal.Flawless condition2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera.With these in mind, the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution), the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness.The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen.i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness.But that means much less battery life.3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediatelyConclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp, less bright screen, and mid range camera.You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.If you are ok with these trade offs, this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised.",2021年6月12日 在美国审核

Also T-Mobile’s new 5G home internet can use 4G Lite bands for large movie streaming users.My 4G phone internet has slowed down on T-Mobile. Need to upgrade my other phone to 5G.

Best Midrange phone,"This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.Second Update (March 18th 2021) Nothing much to add about the phone. My original opinion still stands. The fingerprint scanner can be a pain sometimes but works the majority of the time. Samsung has been doing a good job updating this phone too. I just wish this phone had a headphones jack (at least it has expandable storage).",2020年10月6日 在美国审核

But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag.",2020年10月4日 在美国审核

No Regrets,"I previously used the A71 4G (international version) and loved that phone. However, it had severe signal problems after I moved to a new area, so I started looking for a US version 5G phone. I was considering the A71 5G or the new A52, but I couldn't find one unlocked that would arrive quickly enough. Then I remembered this phone and boom...exactly what I needed, and for just a bit more money than the A52. I don't absolutely need flagship specs, but I must say that I'm enjoying the upgrade from my A71. Everything works flawlessly and fast. Camera is excellent. I do miss the headphone jack, but I got an adapter that works fine. If you're buying unlocked, I think this is a better deal than a new A-series Galaxy!",2021年7月16日 在美国审核

Doesn't seem brand new,I just want to say the battery life is pretty bad for the size of the battery and it seemed like I didn't get a brand new phone. My package came with no plastic wrap around it.

"Tough, durable, awesome phone!","First off, love this phone. Works great for all my needs, and other reviews cover that well.Now the important thing for me- 3 weeks after putting this phone in service, I left it on the roof of my car. After retracing my drive home, I found it in the middle of a 4 lane road by constantly calling it as we drove along the shoulder of the road. Obviously it had been ran over multiple times during the hour and a half it sat there, but the ringing led us straight to it. The only damage was a shattered Supershieldz screen protector and scuffed Otterbox Defender case- the phone is still in perfect condition. True testament to this phones durability, including the gurrilla glass- I still can't believe I'm typing this review on the same phone that was run over multiple times and still laying in the middle of a lane a few short hours ago.Way to Samsung- you have a customer for life!",2021年5月19日 在美国审核

A flagship phone without the flagship price,"I have had the phone for about two weeks. After waiting on TCL 10l 5G, Oneplus Nord (that didn't launch state side)_, and Google Pixel 4a 5G/Pixel 5 I had to jump on on this phone. I was able to get the phone for $100 less then Pixel 5 with a stronger processor by preordering the phone. Another plus is I also got a $70 Samsung gift card for preordering the phone. This is my 3rd Samsung phone since the S3. Sadly their phone were getting too expensive with only two years worth of updates.<br>The Positive: The phone comes with the latest flagship processor,120 hz display, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, and at least 3 years of updates. It comes with fast wireless charge, power share, the underside doesn't feel cheap, and battery last me the whole day between work and playing games. ""The 1st thing that came to mind when I turned the phone on was how I have been missing out on how beautiful Samsung's amoled screens are on.""The bad: It comes with gorilla glass 3 I would invest in a screen protector. Thephone doesn't come with a 25w super fast charger I guess to keep the cost and it is missing a USB c to c cable to transfer data. (the 15W fast charger it comes with takes about 1hr 30 mins to fully charge my phone while the $12 super charge I bought of Amazon takes exactly 1 hr to charge my phone to 100%Another negative for me is Samsung UI which will delay Android 11. My second thought after 1 hour was ""I don't miss Samsung horrible UI and I would prefer a more vanilla android experience.""I really shouldn't have to use a second launcher like Nova to customize my phone.Overall: This phone is feature proof with 5G (won't be viable for another 3 years) and 3 yearsworth of updates. I am very excited about the phone and look forward to Samsung releasing more affordable phones with flagship specs in future. Definitely a better value then any other phone on the market if you can live with Samsung UI.Oddity with 5G not the phones fault: I have tested 5G and 4G on T-Mobile network and for some odd reason I get half the speed 4G gives me. (5G is definitely still in its infant stage and don't expect any real speed differences to come until 2022 with 2025 being reality.)</br>",2020年10月16日 在美国审核

Loving it so far,"I was waiting for the Pixel 5 which came out the same time. The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi &amp; cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away). I'm blown away by the low light pic - I can't explain how well lit the pic is compared to what my eyes perceive.The first day I spent my time uninstalling and disabling whatever I could that was pre-installed by Samsung and tweaked shortcuts &amp; and new to me (Samsung specific) features I wanted. I used the recommended Smart Switch to transfer files from my old phone (namely apps, selected pics, and texts &amp; call records) and I used my saved backup from my launcher (Nova) to bring back the app/screen organization I had customized on my old phone. Now I get to enjoy.It does charge fast and no problems connecting to 2 different Bluetooth headsets.*Update* I realized my original download speed pic was clipped wrong (showed a 2G wifi download speed instead of LTE) so I removed the old and uploaded correct pic (speed increase still stands).I placed prices in as they've changed since I purchased.You can choose to bring your screen refresh to 60 to help extend battery (defaults at 120 - I recommend scrolling feeds and testing both out in other scenarios to see if it's worth it for you). As always, to extend battery on any phone, control background apps and their access, lower your screen brightness when able and keep GPS, wifi, Bluetooth off when not needed. If your phone has bad reception in an area you spend a prolonged period of time in and you don't need to call/text, put your phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on after (if wifi available/needed).",2020年10月11日 在美国审核

When the battery dies, I just plugged them in and go. No more! Funny the literature promotion for this phone didn't include this downgrade. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition features because they are unreliable. The display is so responsive to touch that the phone wanders all over the internet while in my pocket despite all attempts to make it not do that in the settings.

Trash more trash,"So I got this phone around 12pm, activated it with tmobile around 2. Got a screen and case for the thing.

Fortunately for these folks I already did to much to the phone to want to go that far to return. however I would of returned based on the face I just spent from 4pm to now at 8pm trying to successfully update my phone. This is my SECOND S20FE and im very technology savvy. For I use to work for Apple, but I prefer galaxy all the way. But why do I have a brand new phone and I have to to through articles hard resets, updating over and over again just for it to tell me its not updated again! Well finally at 8pm and me not giving up not wanting to have to return the phone I finally was able to successfully update the phone. I called Amazon HELP and they hung up on me. All the way I want to give the phone amazon and SAMSUNG 2 STARS 1 star because I still love galaxy and the other star for my self I guess cause no help from amazon or samsung I fixed it myself. Oh and im also very upset that u locked samsung phones don't have the read receipt feature have to download messages and that even took me another half hour reading articles and discovered on the forum I had to download the carrier services app to even be able to use messages chat features. Even though it says my phone should be compatible to use at this point im just tired....I'll end up buying another phone down the line but right now I don't have time and I guess ill just be grateful for the time being.... will NEVER order from samsung again I guess to get all features you have to be a SLAVE to a carrier!!!",2021年3月26日 在美国审核

Muy buen telefono,"Tengo prácticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada, vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno, quería un s20+ pero después de tantos videos de análisis que ví me decidí por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus, solo el tema de que la parte de atrás es de plástico pero seamos sinceros la mayoría lo ocupará con funda así que estarás poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:Tiene: carga inalámbrica, carga reversible, snapdragon 865, resistente al agua y polvo, 6 de ram, 128 de almacenamiento, tasa de refresco 120, pantalla Amoled, batería 4500 mha, Cargador ""mexicano"" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga súper rápida ya que es lo que admite el teléfono, la entrada es USB c, trae pinchito, admite tarjeta SD, solo un SIM, si se puede usar en México sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas áreas en las pantallas curvas son difíciles de alcanzar, me pasaba mucho con mi s8+, no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y estés más seguro . No tiene entrada de audífonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador, para mí no es ningún problema ya que los audífonos no los ocupo casi.Envío: me tardo en llegar una semana prácticamente pero todo dentro de los días que me marcó desde el inicio la fecha de llegada, pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexión, pero todo eso está contemplado en la fecha de llegada así que todo bien. La caja llegó en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajería, nada agrave prácticamente imperceptible.Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio, no tuve que pagar nada más ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen incluído en el precio anunciado, en México sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el teléfono está en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13,200 es un súper precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el día la batería, llegó con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego prácticamente nada al día, mi mayor uso son las redes sociales, correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego así que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu día con algo de batería y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.Cámaras: si considero que venía de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande, las cámaras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de reseas y verás que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho más que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.En resumen es un buen telefono, me gusta mucho el módulo de cámaras, el color que elegí fue el azul y me agradó mucho, se siente como un premium y luce como un premium, yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi, realme, poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor, estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los aos, yo uso los teléfonos un promedio de 3 aos, siempre Samsung y los he dejado prácticamente como nuevos. Así que si quieres un teléfono bueno, bonito y que te dure unos aos este es tu opción ideal, no te vas arrepentir.",2020年12月2日 在墨西哥审核

Mucho mejor que la serie 20 que tiene Exynos,"Hace unos meses compré el S20 plus con exynos y debo decir que ese celular es una basura. La batería le duraba 8 horas en uso normal!

"Es un buen equipo con base a costo beneficio. Sin embargo, su rendimiento me quedo debiendo.","Hace 5 días me llego mi Samsung Galaxy S20 Fe 5G Cloud Navy. Me quede impresionado ya que llego antes de lo esperado.Llego el equipo en buenas condiciones y totalmente sellado, con su cargador y su cable.Decidí comprar este producto liberado ya que según tengo entendido viene con la versión de Snapdragon. Al venir de un celular de huawei (y al no tener acceso a las aplicaciones de Google) opte por comprar un Samsung de tal manera que ya habia tenido Galaxy S3 hace bastantes aos. Estoy fascinado con su pantallas amoled (característico de Samsung) su calidad de imagen y video, sin olvidar su fluidez ya que cuenta con 120hz (ajustable a 60hz). Me encuentro satisfecho con la compra, sin embargo, el unico ""pero"" que le pongo es... He leído otros comentarios que hablan de un ""buen rendimiento'' y sinceramente por horario de trabajo le he dado un uso básico, visitas a redes sociales espontáneas durante el día. Siendo ya la 5 pm tengo menos de un 55% de bateria tomando en cuenta que casi no lo uso en horario de trabajo. Mi experiencia con Samsung siempre su batería es mala y alargo plazo tiendes a fallar mucho sus baterías (experiencia a equipos anteriores). Quisiera saber si alguien más le ha pasado?

La caja venía abierta y sin hoja de garantía.,"El celular no defrauda realmente, cumple con todas tus espectativas es muy potente y eficiente, se siente el poder de su procesador snapdragon 865 y la eficiencia de la batería es formidable te dura todo 1 jornada laboral de 8 horas sin ningún problema llegas a tu casa fácilmente con el 30 a 35% de batería con un uso frecuente del dispositivo durante el día. te permite saltar de aplicacion en aplicacion rápidamente y navegar por ellas sin qué el dispositivo se alente en ningún momento, se calienta muy poco a excepción de los juegos ahí suele subir considerablemente su temperatura pero no es de una manera exagerada. Las cámaras son excelentes y cuentan con una resolución e interpretación de colores muy balanceados y el modo noche es una maravilla las fotos en cuartos muy oscuros las saca tan claras como si fuera de día.<br>Pero como dije el celular no decepciona el qué decepciona es el estado en el qué lo envían, ya que desde que habres la caja te das cuenta que no protegen de movimientos o golpes bruscos a la caja del dispositivo qué viene dentro y va totalmente suelto. De ahí una vez qué sacas tu articulo te das cuenta que ya ha sido habierto ya que la caja dónde viene el celular no traía los sellos oficles de Samsung, si no más bien un sello común y corriente que puedes conseguir en una papelería, una vez que rompes dichos sellos y abres la caja para ver tu celular y revisas los documentos que suelen traer un celular ""nuevo"" te das cuenta qué la garantía del dispositivo no viene dentro, reafirmando una vez más que la caja fue abierta antes. Después de 20 días de uso del celular el botón de BLOQUEO/ENCENDIDO, se comienzaaflojar y se termina cayendo dejando al botón incerbible. y sin la hoja de garantía dentro de la caja te ponen en un grave predicamento ya que no puedes exigirle una garantía a Samsung porque no cuentas con la hoja. afortunadamente ésto me sucedió antes de cumplirse el mes de oportunidad que te da Amazon para regresarlo y pude devolver el equipó pidiendo mi reembolso, pero si esto hubiera pasado después del mes y sin la hoja de la garantía del celular hubiera tirado 14 mil pesos a la basura. Revisen bien como llega el celular y chequen si su articulo lleva la garantía y si no es así usen y pongan aprueba su celular de manera intesa para detectar los defectos rápidamente y estén a tiempo de pedir el reembolso de su dinero.</br>",2021年8月17日 在墨西哥审核

Info about Honor 5x and Huawei.,"OK, Like a lot of people I don't rate a lot of things but I depend on the ratings of others when I buy so I felt like I should contribute.I am coming from a Note 4, LG G2, Nokia etc.All good phones.This phone deserves the 5 stars.It does not feel cheap in any way.Solid and metal.Fingerprint reader and 5.5 inch good screen is the reason to buy.Another point not talked about is that this uses a more common Snap Dragon processor that is popular in the US.Rooting is also easy due to Huawei (Honor's parent company) giving you the key to unlock the bootloader.If this word is unknown to you, just know that if you get into controlling your phone on a higher level it can be done.Believe it or not, this is huge.One of the only little gripes would be the lack of cases for the phone, but that is to be expected due to the name not well known in the West...YET.Huawei has become the second most common handset in the East in just a few years.It now makes the larger of the two Nexus phones.You are looking at the next Samsung here.Only three companies are in a position where they can manufacture, distribute the hardware (processor), handset and the software.Apple, Samsung and Huawei.This company will be a household name in a year here in the U.S.Companies are already copy them (touch sensor was out prior to the Iphone on the Huawei Mate 7)For the price this is 5 stars, if all else was equal and all phones cost exactly the same, I would say this phone is a 4 stars due to slightly older hardware.",2016年3月6日 在美国审核

good enough!!!!!!,"I had an old Samsung Galaxy S4 that had a battery that would not last and the phone was getting buggy. A friend told me about this phone and I decided to check it out. I am not on contract and buy my phones cash and need to buy two phones so that my mom and I have the same phone and I can walk her through how to use it...so long story short I was happy to spend $400 as opposed to $1200 for two phones.The phone works well, but not perfectly. I was bothered by the lack of an app launcher, but have been able to utilize the Nova Launcher to make the phone operate more like my samsung. It is a good size. The fingerprint reader is very cool. Battery can last a full day .The thing that bothers me the most is that if you click on a link in gmail or in the native email client (which I use for my work email), it will open the browser, but the link itself will not open. It just reloads the last webpage that was open. If you go back to the email again and click the link again, it works the second time around. Sometimes, but not always, you can long press a link and it will give you the option to open in a new window. So that is annoying, but it is otherwise the biggest headache I have had with this phone.",2016年7月1日 在美国审核

The best things about this device are the camera and of course the finger print reader.

Best phone for $200 but not perfect. My whole family has one now.  Bravo Huawei keep up the good work!,"I want to start off by saying I have owned a wide variety of phones and this phone has the fewest bugs on its release date that I have ever dealt with. I have a lot of respect for how quick Huawei has been releasing security patches and Enhancement updates. Huawei has also promised to release Marshmallow and EMUI4 in the near future. The day the phone was released Huawei pushed out a security patch. Huawei is also in the process of pushing out an Enhancements software update that includes Android security patch level for January 2016, Updated honor icons and Additional enhancements (Firmware Version KIW-L24C567B140). More information can be found Club Hihonor forums.Not to mention that the phone has only been release for a month from the time of this review. Bravo Huawei keep up the good work!Update: 24 hours after writing the review the update was released.Before I get into the actual review I would like to add that Huawei is asking for customer feedback and suggestions that will help improve device experience for future updates. Please do a goole search for club hihonor to register and provide feedback.It is very important to provide this feedback so that we can continue to receive these updates. I was unable to provide links as Amazon has blocked the links.Pros:- Price - Hands down the best phone you can buy at 200.- Build Quality - Not the best but not the worst either. It does not feel cheap in the hands.- Quick OTA Updates - Honor does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.- Fingerprint Reader - Sensor location, Speed, and accuracy are just perfect.- 1080P IPS Display - At 401 ppi this screen is big and clear. Accurate colors. iPhones also use IPS displays over amoled.- Battery Life - I am heavy user and easily get a full day out this phone. I can get 5-6 hours of screen on time. Very pleased with battery life.- Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Flash also works very well.- SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps, photos and videos will all install to SD card.- Dual sim - Not something I will ever use but it’s there.- Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. They are loud and perfect for ringtones and notification but not good at high volume for music. They server their purpose and serve it well.- EMUI Launcher - While a bit sluggish at the moment they have done very well with the ease of use of the launcher. Everything is though out very well. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.- Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover, White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Read below for more details on my favorites and least favorite.Cons:- No NFC - This was not an issue for me. Out of the 30 other phones I owned that had NFC I maybe used it 5 times. This may or may not be important to you.- Sluggish Launcher - At this time the launcher is a bit sluggish. This will most likely be resolved in a future update. The phone is fast don’t get me wrong but multitasking button is slow and some apps will sometimes hang but not for long.- No app drawer - I can adapt well to either launcher. If you hate it then install a 3rd party launcher. That is the beauty of android. However it would be nice if they included an option for both.- No headphone included - Im not complaining for 200 bucks I see why they didn’t include them but just so people are aware I thought I would mention it.- Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging and can cut down charge times in half.Wifi - One thing I want to mention right of the bat is the phone does not support 5GHz. However is this really a bad thing like some people have mentioned? Personally I don’t think so and the reason being that 5GHz has a shorter range then 2.4GHz by far. 2.4GHz is still plenty fast but yes has more interferences then 5GHz but I personally have not had an issues with interference. Microwaves and cordless phones are the two number one major interferences on 2.4GHz but who really uses cordless phones now days?I have a AC router that supports both 5GHz and 2.4GHz and all my devices are connected via 2.4Ghz due to the range limitation that 5GHz has. I cannot use my phone outside with 5GHz connection I have to be indoors. With 2.4 Ghz I can be at the neighbors and still get a solid connection to my wifi. Would it have been nice to have both? Sure it would but you may find your self never using it like I do. Yes there are people out there that could benefit from it in highly populated areas where interference is an issue but this should not be a deal breaker.Price/Build Quality - At 200 dollars the phone is an absolute beast! The build quality is very nice and feels very expensive in the hand. However I would strongly recommend getting a clear silicon case to protect your investment as well as a glass screen protector as the metal back cover can scratch easily on your keys. The back cover has a plastic band on the top and bottom so the back cover is not completely metal.OTA Updates- Huawei is pushing out updates faster than any other company I have dealt with excluding the Nexus line of phones. Huawei does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.Fingerprint Reader - The reader works perfect. The location is absolutely perfect and feels natural in the hand. I’m certain that Apple and Samsung will soon copy the sensor location. Other phones like the iPhone and Galaxy phone that have the reader on the home button are very awkward to use. Your finger naturally rests where the sensor is located so unlocking from the pocket is a pleasure. Galaxy phones have issues with detecting your print at time. This phone works nearly every time and under 1-2 seconds. This was not something I expected from a 200 dollar phone. My only complaint is that at the moment you can only registers 5 different prints. Why do you need more you may ask? The software in EMUI allows you to open up certain apps or call a contact with an assigned print. Both mine and my wife’s prints are on my kids phones so now they are limited to only 3 prints they can use to unlock the phone and use as shortcuts.1080P IPS Display - The 5.5 Inch 401 PPI 1080p IPS display is perfect. The screen is very detailed and colors are natural and accurate. However if you are coming from a amoled display and like bright vivid colors that amoled offers you may not like this screen right away but you will definitely get used to it. This is more of a personal preference. Touch responsiveness is perfect even with a glass screen protector. The screen gets very bright outdoors and so far I have no complaints about the screen what so ever. Watching YouTube videos and viewing pictures has been a pleasure.Battery Life - The phone has a 3000 mAh battery. This is probably the best feature the phone has to offer. I’m a very heavy user and have not owned a phone that can get me through a full day. I’ve had to resort to a external power supply that I took everywhere. I no longer have to carry around the extra power supply with this phone and can easily get 5-6 hours of screen on time. I owned a Oppo Find 7a and loved it because of the large 5.5 inch screen. The downside was the battery life but the phone had quick charging and sort of made up for it. However with this phone the quick charging is not needed as it will get you through the whole day. My wife that is not a heavy user can go two days without a charge. The phone actually uses the more expensive Lithium Polymer (Lipo) vs Lithium Ion battery.Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Other phones that I have owned and compared to have to use flash to get a decent picture under low light. This phone did not have to use the flash to get a decent picture under low light settings. The shutter is very fast and so far has taken less blurry photos than 95% of all the phones that I have owned excluding the Galaxy S6, iPhone 6s, and LGG4 (all flash ship phones of course). My daughter is 13 years old and her whole life is around social media and picture taking. She chose the Honor 5x over the Galaxy S6 mainly because of battery life and the location of the figure print scanner. She used both phones for a few days and said she could barely tell the different in the photos. I personally can see that the photos on the Galaxy S6 were way better but to a 13 year old kid they would prefer battery life and a bigger screen over better photos and faster phone. She was unable to tell Galaxy S6 had better camera, Processor and screen then the Honor 5x. I then sold the Galaxy s6 and purchased 3 more Honor 5x's for all my kids for the price of one Galaxy S6.SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps, photos and videos will all install to SD card. Other phones I have owned had an SD card slot but would only allow you to use it for photos and videos. It would not install app on the SD card like the Honor 5x does. I purchased a 32gb SD card and have installed a ton of games, apps, photos and videos on the SD card without any issues. Simply go into settings&gt;Storage and change default location to SD Card.Dual sim - Not something I will probably ever use but its there. You have an option for a Micro sim card and nano sim card. This would be very useful if you own a business and need two lines. One for personal calls and other for business.Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. If you compare to Galaxy S6 or HTC speakers then yes they suck. However if you are comparing to 95% of the speakers on the market they are loud and perfect for ringtones, notifications, and videos. They are not very good for music at high volumes but I don’t know a lot of people that listen to music from there tiny little phone speaker. Most of us have Bluetooth speakers for that. The speakers serve there purpose and serve it well for a 200 dollar phone. Even more expensive phones have a worse speakers then the Honor 5x.Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging so if you have a 2A charger on hand you can cut the charge time in half. 2A charging is also a verified feature on the Honor 5x website so it is perfectly safe to use a 2A charger. Again they most likely sent a 1A vs 2A charger to cut back on cost.Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover, White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Out of the three the black with dark gray back was my favorite. One thing I noticed right away with the White and Gold model is the black border around the LCD. The black model still has the black border but because the front bezel is also black the border was hidden. I have taken pictures side by side so you can see what im talking about. The white was my 2nd favorite and probably would have been my first pick had they done a better job tucking in the LCD border behind the bezel. As for the gold model I did not like it at all. It does not even appear gold and at times looks like a rose gold on the back cover. The front looks more like a copper color than gold. It not horrible or unbearable but it was just the least favorite out of the three for me but my son loves it so thats all that matters.EMUI Launcher/OS - Launchers are a big subject for me because I have dealt with some crappy launchers such as Touchwiz for the Galaxy phones and ColorOS for Oppo phones. EMUI reminds me a lot of ColorOS however the EMUI 3.1 launcher was thought out very well and works way better. I didn’t like that the app drawer was gone it reminded me to much of iOS but quickly got used to it. The OS is still a bit sluggish at the moment taking some apps 1-2 seconds to open at times but I have confidence that Honor will resolve this very soon as this is more of an optimization of the OS vs and launcher issue. The processor is definitely capable of providing a smooth experience it just needs to be optimized so I hope they work on this first. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.Overall I am very happy with this phone. Not only because it was cheap but because it was very well designed and built. Nothing feels cheap about this phone. I have paid 300 more for phones that I was not happy with. Honor has definitely raised the bar for budgets phones pressing other companies to follow the trend. I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a better than average phone on a budget.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: Since the recent update KIW-L24C567B140 the phone performs very well now.However there are two settings that greatly effected performance. When enabling Guest Mode via Settings&gt;Security&gt;Privacy Protection from phone settings menu the phone takes a major performance hit. Apps would hang, at times 10 secs or more to open up the camera shutter button, and icons were missing from home screen and slowly start to appear. However once Guest Mode/Privacy Protection was turned off the phone performed very well. Changing power saving mode from Smart (Factory Default) to Normal also increased performance via Settings&gt;Power Saving. I still also got a full days worth of battery life! I hope that an update will resolve this.Tips:Move multiple icons at once - I took me a while to realize that this was possible but from your home screen you can pinch the screen to bring up the Home Page setting options. You can add wallpapers, Widgets, change page transitions effects and access the More Settings page to change home page settings. Once you have pinched the screen can start to select the icons you wish to move. You will see a blue check mark on the icons you wan to move. Once you are read to move the icons long hold on any one of the blue checked apps you have selected and move the icons. However folders are limited to 30 apps :-(Guest Mode - Pretty cool feature but as stated above this feature really effected the performance of the phone. To enable go to Settings&gt;Security&gt;Privacy Protection and click Lets Start. Enter your main pass code and press next. This should bring you to the Owners Fingerprint screen, do nothing here but press next. You will then be prompted to enter a guest pass code, enter a pass code different from your main pass code. You should now be a the Guest Fingerprint screen, from here you can add a new print or assign an existing print for guest mode. You should now be at the Privacy Protection screen main menu where you can now hide contact, photo albums and hide certain application from the quest account.Notification no longer working? - Ok so EMUI OS will not allow apps to run in the background unless you say otherwise a feature I actually enjoy this may be why the battery life is so good. This will prevent apps like Facebook, Ebay, Facebook Messenger, Spotify, YouMail, Netflix and Dropbox from working correctly and will also prevent push notifications. Example: Spotify and Netflixs will enable a quick menu on your lock screen and notification bar to pause, play and forward music or movies. However if you do not allow the app to run in the background the app will close out once you lock your screen. Another example if Facebook. If someone messages you or if you get an update on Facebook your phone will not notify you until you allow it run in the back ground. If you are having issue with any app try this first. Go to Settings&gt;Protected Apps&gt; and enable all the apps you wish to receive real time notification and any app you wish to run in the background.Tired of the Power Consumption Prompt? I got sick of being reminded that certain apps were consuming a lot of power. To disable the prompts go to Settings&gt;Power Saving&gt;Settings and disable Power intensive prompt.",2016年2月22日 在美国审核

So I contacted Huawei wanting a refund. Now they said since I bought it from Amazon they have to refund it. Amazon said they only do 30 day refunds. Huawei said if I bought it from their store, they would refund it. So now I'm stuck between two huge corporations who handed a problem off to me, so now I'm stuck an expensive piece of garbage.

Super fine phone with a few minor annoyances,"I had fully intended to LOVE this phone. And to be honest, it's growing on me more and more (I've only had it a few days now).Physically, the phone is super fine. Has a nice 'heft' to it (metal casing), nice screen size, well machined and designed. I get all 'squooshy' over beautifully made things - little teeny buttons that work so nice, that kind of thing. So this unit satisfied that need very nicely!I was hoping the FHD screen would knock my socks off, the way the Samsung Note 5 et al always do - dazzling screens. Alas, it didn't exactly do that. It's plenty nice, don't get me wrong, but do I detect a smashing difference between this screen (1080x1920), vs the 720x1080 or something like that that it replaced? Nope, sorry - I just don't notice the difference. Maybe there's something wrong with my eyesight, because all reviewers just rave about the beautiful screen. But I'm beginning to suspect that they're actually just raving about the SPECS for the screen - yes, 1080x1920 is a huge UP from a 720x1080 screen. Sadly, however, the theoretical huge bump just doesn't translate to a huge visual bump.First thing I did was install the Arrow launcher - my very favorite. Then ... I was pretty lost after that actually. Floundering. It astonishes me how much the Android o/s differs from one phone to another. My previous phone had Android 5.0, and this one has Android 5.1. One would think it would be a snap adjusting from one to the other. But - and this really is scarcely covered in the many reviews I read of the Honor 5x - Huawei uses their own GUI on this phone. Just takes quite a bit of getting used to I guess. It has WAAAY more Android setting choices than my previous phone (which I am beginning to love more and more for it's simplicity). Mercy, they're all over the place. And Huawei adds all sorts of apps that I neither need nor want, and can't delete (haven't tried all that hard, but there's no 'uninstall' button when I review the Apps tab in Settings). That always ticks me off - manufacturers stuffing software on a PC or phone. I mean, some of this stuff even had ads in them. Wouldn't be so bad if I could just opt out and uninstall it, but ... well, I'll have to see if I can find an app that will let me kill off some of this stuff.My previous phone, btw, was a BLU LIFE ONE. Just a little 1GB memory, 8GB storage unit. I thought that buying this Honor 5x unit would improve everything - more memory, more disk space, how could I lose? Well, I didn't really lose - but I didn't 'win' anything either. The BLU was, I do believe, even zippier that the Honor 5x! That was a real slap in the face. And my concerns about running out of memory on the BLU were ... ignorance on my part. I just read that Android is built to really stuff the memory chip (by holding loads of programs open in memory), then closing old unused programs as needed. So you don't really run out of memory. !! Now they tell me .. hahaThe fingerprint sensor works well. But - another thing that reviewers fail to note - to use the fingerprint feature, you MUST also use an unlock pin code. Gotta do both or none at all. So, no big deal I think ... I did the fingerprint and PIN routine. For about 2 hours! Super tedious entering the PIN or fingerprint every few minutes, when waking up the phone from sleep. Oy. I don't keep any secret stuff on my phone anyway. You won't find any nude photos of me floating around the internet - and you can thank your lucky stars for that! Ay - maybe I can play with it and find a happy medium for locking but not being so darned intrusive. ? More play time needed.I sound really 'down' on this phone - but I'm not. It's a lovely phone at a lovely price. I would never (EVER) pay $500 or $600 for a phone - it just won't ever happen. I can afford it, but it's simply not worth it.This is probably as close as I can come to a premium phone at a non-premium price. Of course, we all know that in ... 4 months? 6 months? ... I'll be able to get MORE features, and a BETTER screen, and more doo dahs,for just a few pennies more. The lure of the tech stuff! But I think I can live with this phone for many years and be very happy and content.So - no, I'm not down on this unit and yes, I would buy it again. I just wanted you to have my unvarnished comments on some of the less discussed points that came as a bit of a shock to me.",2016年2月21日 在美国审核

Pretty good phone. Large screen.,"I have had this mobile phone for about a month, and I have been quite impressed with its capabilities. The screen is large but still comfortable in my hand. The processor is fast and smooth. I've had a few small glitches when several apps are open, but nothing that makes me complain out loud.Here are some of my favorite things about this phone:1.The touch sensor in the back. I use this to turn on the phone, go back to the home page, toggle around the pages. My kids think the sensor is a blast.2. The clarity of the screen. It's extremely sharp, so pictures and videos look really nice in daylight or the dark.3. The battery life. I don't have to charge this phone everyday, but I use it all of the time. I'm really impressed with the battery life.4. The camera. I have enjoyed using the camera in low light and in the sun. I have not had any complaints of bad pics from this camera. I guess if my kids are moving, I get a blurry shot, but I can't fault the camera for fuzzy kids.5. Memory. I've been able to download a lot of apps and have not felt the camera get sluggish from the apps.I have 16 GB on this phone. There is not a lot of bloat ware on this phone, and for that, I'm glad.6. The price. Can't beat the price!Here are some dislikes:1. Other people have not been impressed with the User Interface when swiping around looking for their apps. I have to agree that the UI is not as user friendly as the Samsung Galaxy that I used before.2. The auto-brightness doesn't seem to work. I have to always dim or brighten it manually.3. The one/off button gets pressed a lot because it's exactly where my fingers are when I hold onto the camera. Also, when I put the phone in my purse, it get pressed when in the purse. Good thing the battery life is long because I often find my phone on inside my purse.4. It's a one sided speaker on this phone. I thought it was broken and HTC had me send it back to check out the speaker. I later found out from a more informed customer service rep that the phone is has ONLY ONE speaker.Overall, I would say this was a great buy. I've had an HTC ,Motorola, Nokia, and Samsung in the past, and this phone ranks in near the top. Well done!",2016年7月5日 在美国审核

Like all other off-brand phones starts out good but ......:(,"I have tried Blu, Zte and this brand and all seem to show it's bugs later on, the various good short term reviews on these type of phones are not to be trusted. This phone was fine for 2 weeks and now is hard resetting (even during phone calls) at random, now I'm a tech guy and can trouble-shoot by factory resetting or install custom roms etc...but not going to waste my time when there are plenty of other phones that do not have major issues that these lesser known budget phones seems to have, so just returning it.For example, I have owned a cheap Samsung Galaxy Prime, mid-range Motorola X Pure and Nexus 5x, all never gave me any serious problems but this phone, BLU Studio XL and ZTE Axon 7 Mini (this one was the best experience out of the 3 mentioned, had issues but did work) seem to deteriorate with time so going to play if safe and stick with a known brand along with leaving entry level phones alone.Moral of the story.... spend a little more on a trusted brand!",2017年3月24日 在美国审核

"Overheating, high draining waste of money","After a few days, I've given up on this device. The battery barely lasts 6-8 hours, with just moderate use, i.e a bit of facebook, 2-3 short videos on youtube, and less than 5 phone calls. If i pick this up and scroll through facebook for a 5 minutes, it already gets hot...I've gone into settings and optimised the battery, removed apps(I even disabled Chrome because it was flagged as the main culprit), optimised timeout, the screen brightness etc. After that didn't work out, I installed a battery saver app. That only marginally helped. I'm losing about 5% an hour when the phone is on standby. A complete waste of money",2017年3月8日 在美国审核

"Takes a lot of work to set-up, but worth it.","Received in box: Phone, sim tray tool, charger w/ cord, and simple “start-up” brochure.I've had this phone for a couple of weeks at the time of this review.Let me start this review by stating that I've had cell phones for nearly 20 years. I always tend to go ""middle of the road"" with my phone models, keep them 1-2 years, then get a new one. No flagships, but no junk, either. I've had LG, Samsung, Moto, etc. Most of the big players in the American market. I've never had an iPhone. I mention this to give a frame of reference on how my experience with cell phones has been formed.When I was shopping for a phone, I had purchased an Alcatel Pop Idol 3 (4.7”), but had problems with a couple of units and ultimately decided to go with something different.At this same time, the Honor 5X was released, and it looked like there were a lot of similarities that appealed to me, for a decent price. I won't re-hash the basic specs that you can read all over the internet, but I'll touch on some things that I've noted and liked/disliked in this review.First impression of the phone: It has a very nice look about it. It's very thin and very light in the hand. The whole face of the unit is glass, and it comes with a plastic screen protector.The aluminum back gives it a pretty high-quality look, overall. If it didn’t have the branding on the back, you’d easily think that this unit is much more expensive than it really is. No complaints.After inserting my SIM and SD cards, and charging up for a bit, I turned on the unit. It walked me through a pretty standard set-up routine. I put my usual apps on it, ran updates, etc. Right from the start, I noticed that I really, REALLY, disliked the UI.(I will go into detail on this below.)My observations:-The Fingerprint reader is really, really fantastic.I’ve never had one before, and I just thought it would be a gimmick that I wouldn’t care for.I was wrong.As I pull my phone out of my pocket, I can have it un-locked by the time I’m looking at the screen.I’m not taking full advantage of all of its features, but the few features I am using are really handy.This may be one of the most stand-out features on this phone.-To me, the most important thing with a cell phone is its ability to function like a phone. It seems weird to feel the need to state this, but I bet a lot of people rarely actually call people and talk to them w/ their cell phones. I have T-Mobile, and while I generally don't have reception issues, my neighborhood actually seems to be pretty spotty and my last phone would often drop calls in certain sections of my neighborhood. In my house, I would often have to use my wi-fi to make calls. The Honor 5X’s reception is pretty good, overall, but not great. Calls sound just “OK”.Nothing remarkable.-The speaker on the Honor 5X is fairly average. Music sounds OK on the speakers, as long as volume is kept below max.Speaker phone calls are a bit “tinny” sounding. I wish that there were two speakers, for better sound distribution.Overall, sound quality may be this phone’s weakest quality, in my opinion.-The picture quality of the screen is quite good. Colors are good, images seem decently sharp. Not as nice as a Galaxy, or iPhone, but it’s definitely good for this price-level. I watched a bunch of Netflix, Youtube, etc. and I was really impressed overall.No artifacts or anything distracting.In super bright sunlight, this phone is just OK, but not many phones do well in that regard.Otherwise: brightness, clarity, etc. are all very good.-I found the size of the unit to be right on the edge of “too big”. I actually am a very tall guy, big hands, etc. and you would think that I'd like a bigger phone, but honestly, I like to be able to put the phone in my pocket, or be able to access all of the functions with one hand.This is all personal preferences, of course, but I like to mention it.-The battery life is very good, even on the lowest battery-saving setting.I am not exactly a ""heavy user"" but I do make calls, check emails, check Twitter, and watch the occasional vid. I don't really do games, aside from the occasional solitaire. I leave the wifi and GPS on 24/7. At first, when I was setting this phone up and tweaking it, etc. I was worried because it seemed like the battery life was very poor.Once I got everything set-up and finished updates, etc. I now easily get over a day before needing to charge. If I have particularly light usage during a day and don't watch any video, I can go almost 2 days before needing to plug-in.-The cameras, both front and back, are pretty good, I think. I take a lot of pictures for work and hobbies, but not for ""portraits"" or anything like that, more record-keeping. My requirements are pretty low. I can say that with good lighting, the rear camera takes very nice pictures. If you're used to phones in this price range, the cameras are going to seem pretty normal. I don’t like the way that the camera sticks out from the back of the phone, as I find that it catches on my pocket, or it seems like you’re bound to scratch the lens when you set the phone down on its back.I bought a case that solves this problem, but I think Honor should have incorporated the lens a little more smoothly into the design of the phone.As for what I didn't like about the phone:-This phone takes FOREVER to fully charge.It has been noted that the included charger is a 1-amp charger, which is baffling with a battery this large.Even using a 2-amp charger, this phone still takes ages to fully charge.I think a fully-charged battery should get most people through a full day, though, so it shouldn’t generally be a problem.If you are a very heavy-duty user that is away from power for extended periods, then you probably carry a power-bank anyways.-I just do not care for the native UI on this phone, and this is the reason I rated this phone 4 stars vs. 5 stars. It is so cluttered and hard to personalize.And not having an app-drawer is seriously annoying. I thought all of the reviews about this phone were exaggerating about this point, but they are not.I am not any kind of expert on Android's different iterations. I don't tweak my phones, or run different ROMS or anything like that.I’ve never loaded a different launcher on a phone before.When I first received this phone, I found the IOS-like interface to be so hard to work with that I followed the many online recommendations to load a different launcher.I went with Google’s app launcher, and it really made this phone so much better.If I were not able to do this, I probably would have returned this phone.This is a highly personal preference, and somebody else may prefer to have the EMUI’s features.I did not.My recommendation to anybody that buys this phone:Search Youtube for ways to optimize this phone.It really takes this phone to the next level.Set the battery savings setting to its lowest level (don’t worry, it still lasts a long time).Get a different app launcher.This phone has taken more effort than any other phone I’ve had to get it set up the way that I like, but I think it’s worth it in the end.The bottom line:Despite my criticisms above, I would recommend this phone to others, and I have no regrets in purchasing it.I think if you have realistic expectations of a mid-range phone, then you will be happy with this.",2016年3月7日 在美国审核

It is perfectly good enough for me for what I expect from a cell phone, i attached few pictures. The phone works very well, fast enough. I purchased also 32 GB SD card.

Solid budget smartphone,"I got this phone to replace my aging OnePlus One phone. I figured for the price and the reviews it gets it was worth a shot. I've had it for about a month now and it's turning out to be a solid phone. The only real comparison I can give it is with my OnePlus One. I think the OnePlus One is still a better phone but it's probably due to it having 3GBs of RAM and the Honor 5X only having 2GBs of RAM. It is a little sluggish at times but not a deal breaker. The best thing I've done for the phone was to unlock the bootloader and install CyanogenMod CM13 as the OS. It isn't hard if you have experience with that sort of thing and turns the phone into something I feel like I can keep using as opposed to a phone to get me through till I can afford one I really want. If you're looking for a budget unlocked smartphone this is one I'd recommend. If it had 3GBs of RAM I would've given it 5 stars. Also, I live in a rural area and have no trouble getting 4gLTE. One more note: you should consider installing CyanogenMod to replace the stock OS. It supports all the phones features (aka the fingerprint sensor) and really improves the performance.",2016年10月20日 在美国审核

I use straight-talk.I had to call their customer support (oddly enough honor x5 imei is not accepted)the tech support asked me if I used the phone after i inserted my old sim.Sure enough with NO set up everything was working as is.Camera: not great but it will certainly get the job done.I used a lumia 635 for a year or more, and that phone has no flash.audio:could do with another speaker to give stereo sound, but lil thing is sure LOUD. god help you if you forget to lower ringtone when it first arrives.Comes with screen protector pre-installed: great! hate doing that myself.Battery: pretty good but man they could do with fast charging, cuz it takes this thing a while.Web browsing:great, video playback and all.USB OTG:apparently is ""on the phone, but needs to be enabled by software""as of right now, however its still unavailable.(Suggestions) Huawei/Honor 5x team should certainlylook into having a sort of ""trade-in"" program.That way we the users can recycle old model phones,and get new ones that have small interations of improvements vs the last phone.The manufacture can recycle old units for the materials. Win win for all!Gyroscope:its a requirement, world is stepping into VR territory, no one wants to be left behind.USB OTG:need I say more?enable it! lolNFC:common now,how did you even leave this out??Audio: coudlnt hurt to have the other ""faux speaker grill, actually be a working speaker"" other than that dont change a thing.",2016年4月6日 在美国审核

Great phone for under $200,"I am having a very hard time reading from the small 4.7"" iPhone 6 screen.Before the new iPhone 7 with the large screen comes out, I bought this phone to use for the time being.I paid $120 during Amazon Prime Day and I rated this phone a 4 star due to a couple of issues.Prior to the Marshmallow upgrade, I couldn't use the mirror feature with the Chromescast to stream movies as the signal kept getting interrupted.It was so painful and frustrated to the point that I stopped using this feature.Another negative thing was the limited fingerprint sensor capability.I could use this to unlock the phone screen and that was about it.I could not use the fingerprint sensor to unlock mobile apps like the iPhone 6 could.Aside from these issues, the 5.5""1080p resolution screen and the ability to expand storage to 128gb with a micro sd card were the main reasons for me to get this phone.Anyway, I recently read that Honor rolled out the Marshmallow upgrade however, I couldn't get it over the air as the roll out is done in stages.I found out that Marshmallow is available for download from the Honor website.There were no instructions in how to do the manual upgrade from the website.After several trials, I eventually figured it out.After the upgrade, I am able to stream movies using Chromecast with no interruption issues and I can use the fingerprint sensors to unlock a few mobile apps such as Bank of America, Chase and Hilton Honor.I read that more companies will have fingerprint unlock feature available.This is good news for me as I no longer have to type lengthy passwords to access apps.The fingerprint sensor is located on the back of the phone which could be difficult to access in a phone cradle when driving.I was able to reach the sensor using a Kenu air vent mount holder so not much of an accessibility issue there.This is how I did the manual Marshmallow upgrade: I used a Mac Mini to download the zip file using this link: [...]The Mac Mini automatically unzipped the file once the download was completed.I copied the dload folder to an external micro sd card and then I inserted the sd card into the phone.I then went to Updater in Settings.From Updater, I selected Menu and then Local Update.The phone began the update automatically.The whole process took about 40 minutes from downloading, unzipping, transferring and installing the Marshmallow update file but it was really worth the effort.Now, I have to focus on the cons.I own pretty high end earphones Shure E4, Klipsch X11i and 1More e1001 and sorry to say none sounds great with the Honor 5X phone.The iPhone 6 is much better in the sound department.Don't get me wrong, the Honor 5X still sounds good but not great.The photo quality is not flagship phone quality but I knew that when I bought the phone.The phone screen is not glass and came with a cheap plastic screen protector.I replaced the plastic screen protector with a tempered glass protector to make it look more high end.The metal back casing however has a high end look which most budget smartphones do not offer.I was torn between the Honor 5X and the Moto G Plus.The Moto G plus has a better camera but comes with a plastic housing.I don't take a lot of pictures so a better camera is not high on my list besides the Honor 5X photo quality is very acceptable.Conclusion:The Honor 5X is a great phone with the Marshmallow upgrade.It has good battery life, speedy processor and large beautiful resolution screen.I took the sim card out of the iPhone 6 and inserted into the Honor 5x and the phone picked up AT&amp;T LTE right away.Even though the wifi is not ac but I have not encountered any wifi connection problem.I had a Blu HD phone once and it took several hours in an AT&amp;T store to get it activated and worked properly.I had no activation issue with the Honor 5X.I was thinking about using this as a hold me over phone but I do not see the need to go with a new iPhone.You can't use Android Pay with this phone as there is no NFC but I never use Apple Pay even though it is available on the iPhone 6.For $120, you will not get a better phone with features like these.I just wished that the sound quality could be better.Update:After I did a manual update to Marshmallow, the GPS stop working.The phone simply can't pick up a GPS signal.Contacted Honor today and was told they are working on it and don't know when a fix will come out.Owners can either send their phones back for a downgrade to Lollipop or just have to patiently wait until a fix comes out.Very disappointed with how they handle the situation.Update on 8/2/2017.Received a software upgrade OTA and the GPS issue is resolved.The phone is working the way it should.I am upgrading from 1 star to 4 star.I took away 1 star for the inconvenience.",2016年7月7日 在美国审核

Bad experience,"I bought this phone brand new unlocked on Amazon. I had not purchased a tough screen protector, or sturdy case since I didn't see one I liked on Amazon. I did end up buying a clear case from Best buy which I don't recommend buying if you're looking for heavy duty protection. Unfortunately, I tripped and fell whileI outside running. My complaint is that Huawei customer service is horrible. The first time I called, I spoke to Priscilla who stated the phone warranty is only for software, and that she would send me an email on how to get it fixed, and I would have to pay $74+ first before they would fix my phone. Fast forward two days later, and no email with instructions on how to get my phone fixed. I call again today and spoke with Candy. She goes through all the motions as if she was going to help me. After being on hold, she then states they don't have the parts for the phone. I get that this is an older version Huawei smartphone, but why would you sell it knowing you don't have repair parts? I suggest doing thorough research before buying anything online because sellers do omit important information, and customers will not always know what to look for or what questions to ask. They don't care after they get your money. I would give ZERO stars if possible. The phone size is decent, but software along with updatesis veryw. They send a sorry slow charging charger with the phone. It'snot anything special being compared to Samsung or other brands, but it's true when they say you get what you pay for.",2017年5月5日 在美国审核
Trying to be fair,"The phone does what it's supposed to. I do like the fingerprint unlock feature a lot. I like how big the screen is. The battery life is pretty decent. The only problem is I had an amazing phone before this, so this one is up against that one in my mind. This is a good phone, it's just nothing amazing. I had my ASUS Zenfone 2 for a year or more and it's camera is AMAZING, this one isn't even comparable. Honestly I hate this camera. The placement of the keys on my old phone have me spoiled, I lock the screen on this phone unintentionally so often it drives me nuts.I have said repeatedly that I hate this phone, but it's only because I'm comparing it to the ASUS Zenfone 2. I will be giving this phone to my husband and spending the extra money for my old one. He likes phone and his is getting old.",2016年5月11日 在美国审核

Disappointing performance,"I am not in the habit of putting products down online, but 3 weeks after buying this device I sent it back to Amazon. Thankfully they took it back. The device was extremely disappointing to use. So sluggish, so slow, so infuriating. The UI sucks badly, no unread count badges except for Email. And when you install an alternative launcher it bogs down horribly. The fingerprint sensor is good. The device looks good but is so light and thin I had to get a case. Not a big deal for many people, I know. Screen is only so-so considering the resolution. I know it's not supposed to be top-of-the-line, but for me, it's not worth the money. I'd rather get a better quality phone that was used.",2016年11月30日 在美国审核
Good replacement phone but definitely not an iphone.,"It's a great and practical phone. I had to purchase the Huawei as a replacement for my iPhone 6 plus that was too much for me to repair. It had been awhile since I had been back to TEAM ANDROID but this phone had tons of good reviews and word of mouth so I though I'd try it. Here are some pros and cons.Things I love:-Easy to use and just had to insert my AT&amp;T sim card.-Able to add more storage with an SD card.-Battery life is okay and gives you an option to minimize usage when your battery is low. As well as let's you know when you have apps that are greatly killing your battery.-Format is very similar to iphone and easy to modify to your liking.-Screen protector was already installed on the phone which was great. I would definitely recommend to buy one regardless because after a month the scratches on the screen protector were VERY visible and I was not very rough on my phone's screen.-Very thin phone and is lighter than my iPhone 6 plus.Things I wish were better:- The camera- although there are great features the quality of photos cannot be compared to the iPhone. I was always the one to take pictures and with this phone I'm kind of embarrassed to be the first to volunteer to take a pic or video. Also there is a delay when taking a photo which makes taking a quick pic a little hard.- Finger print on the back of the phone makes it super simple to unlock your phone. However it's very sensitive, so if you're holding your phone under your arm it starts to vibrate like you are trying to unlock your phone.- After market chargers suck on the phone- while charging I can't be on my phone because it reacts to other parts of the phone like another key or the square bottom. Stick with your charger you received with the phone.-Headphones- it didn't come with any which I felt was strange and sad. You cannot use your iPhone earbuds as a headset when you're making a phone call because although you can hear them the mic will not work.-Phone does get hot after being on a game for a while and battery does quickly die if on for awhile.",2016年6月16日 在美国审核

I finally had to turn off my protection to open or start the phone because 'fingerprint does not match'. I know after 3 fingerprint denials it opens the number screen pad and you enter your password. that's a lot of work to be able to use your phone every time the phone keeps Shutting Itself Off! and I cannot fix my fingerprint because the Fingerprint Management Screen won't stay open... as I type this review I tried to get in again: deleted my two registered prints that are never recognizedtried to add a new one, 3/4 of it was done when the page closed and sent me to the Home screen.on a call sounds from the other end are all distorted/ and garbled. I don't know if it's the whole phone problem or a perhaps just a speaker issue. I can't understand the IVR telling me what to do.Any Hold Music is way off and Most Important I have to keep asking for repeats from the person i am trying to talking to.you cannot use the phone's Help Screen to email Huawei because the country has to be picked from the dropdown or the email cannot even be started without a country selected. The United States is not on the list. neither are Canada and England.

After owning 2 Different Samsung phones in a short period of time, the G2 stayed until now for a reason.It was a great phone.So when I started to look for a replacement, I was looking for a couple of features I didn't want to do away with, which I found here, and SO many more!I also bought aMotorola Moto X Pure first, then this.The screen on this phone is 10x better than the Moto X Pure, which really surprised me.Whites are white on the Honor 5X, as compared to yellow on the Moto when compared Side By Side.Apps load within 1 second of each other as well, and the Moto is suffering from Bluetooth Dropouts after 6.0 update.So with all that, and this phone being half the price, the choice was easy.Back to the Honor.Every review / article I read, seems to be positive other than they all hate the EMUI Android Skin this and other Huawei phones use.Personally, I like it.A lot of people love stock android because it's simple.To me, it's TOO simple...everything is flat, ugly turquoise and you can't do something as simple as display the battery percentage in the status bar, without rooting your phone.Not here.The Honor 5x has a TON of useful features and customization options, not to mention the simplest of ones, like being able to re-arrange the soft-keys so the back button is naturally closer, on the right side, to your right thumb, if you're right handed.Another great feature is double tap to wake the screen, which, for me is VERY useful.Even with Fingerprint security setup, when the phone is in the car mount, you can still double tap and put in a quick pin, and not have to take it out of the mount and search for the power button.At first, the fingerprint reader, was not at all a factor, and I thought I wasn't even going to set it up and use it.Then, I tested it out and really like it now.The fingerprint control, like swiping down to pull down the notification menu / swiping up to show recent apps and registering a different finger to open a certain app is genius, and already comes natural while using the phone, which means this will be a must on any future phone I may buy.I've had this phone 3 days and every time I go into settings I find other awesome features.Just today, under APPS&gt;MORE&gt;CALLS, you can set it to Intensify Vol/Vibrate when phone is in your pocket.I keep my phone on vibrate in my pocket at work all the time and used to miss text's, e-mails constantly...not anymore.It's little things like this (there is a TON) make this a worthy replacement and a HUGE upgrade to my aging G2 and for a third of the price.The only negative I have found so far is in the camera.Specifically the slow motion video.When I take a video in slow-mo, the camera app for some reason leaves a couple of seconds at the beginning and end at full speed, making you stretch the bar at each end to make the video 100% slow motion.Not a big deal at all.The video itself however is HORRIBLE.I am either missing a setting or this thing is not recording native 120FPS.The video comes out grainy and very choppy as if you quick software processed a regular video into slow motion.Also, if you click the Info button, it shows a resolution of 640x480.This is a minor negative of course, however 720p 120FPS is clearly advertised as a major feature of this device.Hopefully a software update fixes this.The rest of the camera is far better than you'd expect on such a low $$ phone, but obviously nothing spectacular, other than, again tons of little features in the camera settings like:Capture smiles, object tracking focus, chose what the volume buttons do, the power button does, what holding down the shutter does and, a ton more settings.Performance wise, this phone is a bit faster, generally speaking than my G2, when loading apps, but ""feels"" 10x faster overall,because things just flow smoothly.There is no choppiness while scrolling a simple web page or twitter, and all the animations are smooth and lag free. This would indicate, that since this is a $200 phone using a ""mid range"" processor, Huawei has done a great job optimizing the Software/Hardware to work together flawlessly. I can't wait for android 6.0 EMUI 4.0 which I'm sure will be even snappier and bring on even more features.Everything you can read about this phone elsewhere is true.-Solid Feel-Very Fast, and more importantly, Accurate fingerprint reader.-Beautiful Screen-Tons of Features-Great Battery LifeI am very satisfied with my purchase.At$200 you get way more than you should if you compare to other phones.I would like to see a $100 more premium/flagship version with NFC (for Android Pay)and Quick Charge, which are probably the only 2 things missing from this phone that a lot of people use, but if you don't need them, this phone is IT!",2016年2月16日 在美国审核

For $199 USD Huawei Offers More Specs Than Other Budget/Mid-Range Phones Out There.,"Huawei has been known to produce relatively good budget smartphones and more recently some mid-range and high-end (or high priced) devices such as the Nexus 5X and 6P.The Honor 5X falls into the 'budget' category with 'mid-range' specs. For $199 USD it is a great deal. If you can live without the CONs below then this phone is right for you. Otherwise be prepared to spend another $100 - $150 USD.PROs:***Most of the specs it offers is similar to the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, One Plus X and Nexus 5X/6P***Fingerprint scannerDual-SIM LTE slots AT&amp;T, T-Mobile compatibleSnapdragon 615 Octa-core processor16GB built-in storage128GB microSDHC removable expandable storage2GB of RAM5.5-inch IPS LCD Corning Gorilla Glass screen1920 x 1080p13MP front 5MP back camerasAircraft-grade alumimium metal constructionFM Radio3000 maH batteryCONs:No NFC (No Android Pay?)No WiFi Calling (this seems to be carrier specific)No 5 GHz AC WiFi (only 802.11 BGN)Older version of Android Lollipop 5.1.1 (through there have been news of proposed Marshmallow 6.0 update)No USB Type C (stills uses microUSB therefore no fast-charging)16GB built-in storage is so limited (but the 128GB expandable helps)Final Comments:Again for the price of $199 USD Huawei gives more than enough specs.Many dislike the EMUI skin/launcher, but it does not bother me.You can always install another skin/launcher.TWRP 3.0 and Root is already available and installable.Hopefully Custom ROMs will be out soon.The Fingerprint scanner is very good and gives a faster response than the iPhone and HTC A9.I have yet to test and see if it works in purchasing apps.I will update the review as soon as I find out.",2016年2月11日 在美国审核

Doesn't Age Well,"I've had this phone for over a year now, and let's be clear: it's a great deal. It's a functional android smart phone and it's under $200. But the longer I have it, the more I want to tear my hair out, so I recommend spending an extra $100-$300 for a phone that will last longer and be less of a headache.I loved the phone at first, but around 4-5 months in, the speed crashed, and it continues to worsen everyday. My phone is not cluttered. In fact, about 40% of my storage space is still empty. But searching a simple question on Google can take over 3 minutes, checking my Facebook can take over 2 minutes just to boot up and load, and god forbid I want to open snapchat.Other features have become buggy overtime. The camera no longer shoots videos, the music player constantly crashes, and the fingerprint scanner that I once adored now takes at least 3 scans to unlock the phone.This phone is great if it's just a backup phone, or a filler phone for a couple of months. It looks great and feels good to hold, but don't expect it to last very long.",2017年4月2日 在美国审核

It's amazing what you can get for $199,"Was tiring of iOS and missed many integrated things about Android. Sold, sold an iPhone 6s Plus, paid off the Apple loan, and began a hunt for a new phone. Did a JUMP on demand with T-Mobile for the LG G4. Nice phone, great camera. For $399 it's a great deal. Have four days to take back so wanted to look for possible unlocked alternatives. Was not ready to pull the trigger on a Nexus 6P just yet. Looked at a Nexus 6 too even though it's over 15 months old now - but for $399, it's a great phone too. Then, I saw this 5X being reviewed all over the place, with reviewers going nuts over the $199 price. So, luckily, went straight to Amazon and bought it on release day, January 31st. Was expecting this to be a ""holdover"" phone while I searched for a permanent higher-end Android. It arrived today.After installing all my apps and knowing that this pretty much resembles - software designn-wise - iOS - I have to say this is a very pleasant surprise. May keep this handset a while. I'm kind of amazed this level of tech can be had for $199. The fingerprint unlock works awesome, the fingerprint gestures are quite innovative, and I'm actually quite a fan of Huawei's software design choices. While they echo iOS quite a bit, the EMUI feels quite elegant and works rather well. We will see how a few days goes and if things get weird with the 5X, but for now, my opinion is that this is an incredible bargain for $199. Yes, I only have 1GB of storage left after all the app installs (would have paid $30 more for 32GB!), but once Marshmallow comes along and storage can be combined, don't think this will be an issue. I'm not a gamer, so won't need any large games.If I keep this - which I probably will for a while - will have to get a tempered glass screen protector and a TPU case. Many reviews noted that the glass does not have oleophobic coating, although the preinstalled plastic screen protector will work for now. No NFC - minor worry at this point really. Used it a total of 10 times in a year on the 6 Plus and 6s Plus. Nice, but not required.Lucky to have this since now shipping times are higher (even with Prime). Way to go, Huawei. Really scored big here. Of, and the underlying Android version is 5.1.1.",2016年2月2日 在美国审核

Handicapped by a Mediocre Camera,"For $200, it's not bad. However, if you have active kids that you love to take pictures of this is definitely not the phone for you. I tried several outside this afternoon while the kids were playing in the yard. All of them came out blurry. Outside. Sun shining. That being said, the rest of the phone is very nice. Build quality is great. Fingerprint scanner works amazingly well and pretty quick. Much better than the one on my Note 5. OS runs smooth with no noticeable lag. There are many options to tweak outside of the typical Android ones. There is no app drawer, which may throw some people. The skin is very similar to iOS. However, install any of the many launchers available from Google Play and your app drawer will be available. All in all, for $200, this phone is hard not to like. However, for $220 you can get a waterproof Moto G that has a better camera (IMHO) and timely updates (at least to Marshmallow... After that, who knows???). It's hard to go wrong with either.PROS-Price-Fingerprint Scanner works great!-Dual Sim-Expandable Memory-Likable Skin with some original useful features / options-No noticeable lagCons-Camera-No NFC (not that important to me, but might be to some)-No 5 gHZ Wi-Fi (not that important to me, but might be to some)-No quick charging or wireless charging-Updates, while promised, are not guaranteed.

For the (very) brave,"First of all, let me start by saying I have been trying out several budget-friendly, unlocked phones, such as the Nexus 5x, Oneplus X, and the Moto X Pure. I also have tried the Nexus 6p and Samsung Galaxy S7. I have been trying to find a good replacement for my HTC One M7 that I really loved, and unfortunately, this phone missed the mark badly.The Good:-Cheap at $200-Expandable storage-Decent Camera-Decent battery lifeThe Bad-After using it, $200 seemed like a rip off and I paid too much.-Really bad screen. Not touch sensitive and you could really see the lack of high resolution.-Terrible performance. Very sluggish, very laggy. My 30 month old HTC M7 was faster.-Bluetooth experience was awful with random disconnects for no good reason, forcing me to repair it with my devices constantly.-Audio quality was terrible.-No updates. No Marshmallow. The UI this phone uses is a hot mess.The Ugly-The headphone jack stopped working about 7 days in. Anytime you plugged in headphones, horrible static would occur. The only way I was able to listen to music was through Bluetooth, which was already giving me problems. I would guess this was a defect, but it didn't come out of the box like that, and I kept it in great condition in a clean environment so clearly it just quickly degraded.I don't typically post negative reviews but I had to on this phone. I highly recommend to stay clear of this phone. It is not worth it to save $100 and pass on a Nexus 5x, a moto x pure, or even the OnePlus X (which I loved).

No NFC,This phone is only for beginners...Pros:~Large and sleek!~Fast pretty accurate fingerprint reader.Cons: ~Has a old processor that is 8 cores BUT VERY SLOW.~Has 2gbs of RAM but has a very very bad lag.~Colors on screen are horrible~Large battery but only lasted 7 hours when just laying not used at all on Airplane mode.~There is no AC wifi!!!!!!!!!~There is no NFC so the fingerprint reader can't be used for payments.The overall score on the Antutu Benchmarks was VERY BAD. Even when I compared it to several of my 3 and 4 year old phones while side by side.,2016年5月2日 在美国审核
A $199 piece of JUNK!!!!!!!,"Phone looked great out of the package! After powering up the screen started to freeze to the point I had to restart the device. I thought it was just a warming up problem, but I soon found out it would just freeze while a call was in place where you could not answer the new call or switch back from speaker phone.A total $199 piece of junk! I'm returning today! Plus how can a smartphone come without earphones! Buyer BEWARE!!!!!!!",2016年4月5日 在美国审核
Data hog. Huge phablet.,"**I paid full price for this phone. **This phone uses a lot more data than a smaller phone. Hopefully you have unlimited data, or else. This phone works with usb otg cables and wireless display after the Android 6.0 update. Wifi Direct also works for transferring items.I thought I had big hands, but this phone is ridiculously large. It has features to make it easier to use, but it is big and heavy. It would be the perfect phone if it were an inch smaller. I will probably have to return it. These phabletsare going to look dumb in a few years when phone companies finally start making smaller phones again.Requires a little tool to access the SD card slot, and the nano Sim card is on the same tray. Not convenient for swapping out the SD cards. I got a sim adapter, so I could use my nano sim in the other tray.Tethering/Hotspotno longer works with straight talk wireless, but that might just be an android 5.1 issue.Fingerprint sensor is amazing. Similar specs as the iPhone 6plus. Download Apex launcher and that will make the phone better. The gravity app also adds the missing active display elements that make life easier.",2016年2月9日 在美国审核

maybe the best android phone in its class (available at US that is) (updated),"Good phone, match what I have read so far.On the plus side:- Speedy finger prints (suffered from Samsung Tab S's clumsy and unreliable swipe finger print, this is heaven.)- Good battery standby (2% decrease overnight)On the minus side, when I take a phone call, the screen goes complete dark and can't bring it back by touching (you can get it back by click the power key), also the speaker voice sometimes feels tapering off ... need more time to get used to; Also, the default system font feels weird, so it is thin and small, and doesn't match with the rest of the fonts.Bottom line: the best in its class. Hoping for Marshmallow update.Update: after a month, Honor 5X received its first update and it is a letdown ... First, the update itself is a 125MB package without any note on what it is for; Second, and more important to the take off of one star: after the update, two apps are added and put on, both seems to be advertisement, one is hotel booking, the other is a link to store. I think this is really a low play for such a nice phone. For some company like Huawei aspiring to be international and a premium brand, whatever the revenue coming with these two ad. app (which btw a common practice among Chinese mobile vendors) are just *NOT* worth it.",2016年2月3日 在美国审核

Everything else still works!At first this seemed like the perfect device. Cheap, good performance, looks good. Then, to my horror, I discovered there was no gyroscope... You had the money to put a gimmick fingerprint censor and no money for a core feature of a modern phone?It's like driving home a new car and discovering that it doesn't have a brake light.This didn't even seem like a feature I had to check for before buying but I guess I learned my lesson now.....If you don't care about having a gyroscope for VR and whatnot, this phone is pretty much perfect for the price.

Unreal deal! It's a real steal! Impressive all the way around!,"I just got this phone today February 2nd 2016. I am completely impressed with this phone. It feels much more expensive than what it costs and looks amazing, you won't be embarrassed of this phone in public I promise you. Now the metal back doesn't feel as premium as say the Iphone 6, but it doesn't cost as much either. It still feels very nice. I was afraid this phone would be to big but it really wasn't. I was coming from using an LG G2 which has a 5.2 inch screen. This phone is just a little taller but no wider than my G2 with a case on it. It surprised me by how compact it really was. Like i said taller, but no wider than my G2 was in it's a case. It has tons of features and settings and the fingerprint scanner is spot on.Nice touch!!With all the settings it can seem a little overwhelming even with somebody like me who is used to android phones. The Honor UI is gonna take some getting used to without a doubt. First thing i done was install Action Launcher and it made the phone feel a little more like stock Android but there's just some things a launcher won't fix. All in all the Honor EMUI has some nice touches, I don't hate it. But like I said it has tons of settings for you to play with and figure out. My phone came with 54% battery and I set it up and downloaded all my apps and changed things to the way I wanted them and that took a little over 3 hours and the battery had 7% when i put it on the charger. So the battery seems like it's going to be great, which is what most of the reviews said that iv'e read. I haven't tested the camera other than a few quick shots just to make sure it worked. It doesn't have OIS though and that really sucks. It does have FM radio on it though. Honor also informed me that they was pushing out the first update for this device February the 15th maybe even a little before then. It's not the marshmallow update though, probably a security patch. It's nice to see them standing behind this product like they said they would. That's a good sign. Also i haven't had any lag what so ever. The phone is responsive and feels very fast. Not flagship fast but it's just as fast as my LG G2. I'm really happy with my purchase! If you're still thinking. go ahead and get this phone. You will love it! Nice build, fast fingerprint scanner with plenty tricks, fast and smooth during streaming and browsing and all for $200.00! You can not beat this phone at that price. It's impossible. UPDATE: (2/3/16) I just found out from HONOR that this phone is running the Snapdragon 616 not the 615!! Another plus! Sure enough I ran Antutu on my phone and it says Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 and scored around 34,000 to 36,000. Also this battery is a beast!! I got a little over 6 hours of on screen time with my phone being off the charger for over 20 hours! I am so happy with this phone. Also if you use a 5V/2A charger the phone will charge in about 2 hours. You're looking at over 3 hours if you use the charger that came with it. I just used my LG G2 charger as it was 5V/2A. Today was my first full day using the phone and i am extremely pleased with it so far. WIFI and Bluetooth worked perfectly and the sound through the headphones is really good. Has more bass than my old LG G2. Sounds good in my car through Bluetooth as well. Also on my LG G2 i constantly had around 2 bars of reception while indoor. NOT with the 5X. It must have a really strong antenna because right now my LG has 2 bars and the 5X has 4 bars! And they are sitting next to each other. That's another big win for Honor. The more bars you have the better the signal and the faster the LTE!UPDATE: (2/8/16)I had to return my first unit for a replacement because it felt like the bottom left side of the phone was coming separated also the screen was going bad, it had lines running through it. It was hard to see for the most part but using the Hello app it was really noticeable. I have already received my replacement and so far so good. It seems like it's put together and built the way it was meant to be in the first place. Also on the same Hello app there are no lines. Screen looks perfect. I'm so glad to because i completely love this phone so i was praying that my replacement would come and work perfectly and it did!! Also for anyone that needs to know how to move your photos and music and contacts among other stuff download the app SUPERBEAM. All you have to do is download it on both phones you want to send and receive with and presto! It's amazing, easy and free! It's super fast. Way faster than Blutooth and so simple. Try it out, trust me you will love it. I transferedall my music (around 120) in about 7 to 8 minutes. It's the way to go with no NFC and faster than Blutooth. I LOVE MY HONOR 5X!!!!!!UPDATE: (2-9-16)I have Straight Talk and I'm unable to use the WiFi Hotspot. Every time I try it informs me to dial 611 from the phone which takes me to Straight Talk hotline. Just wanted to let all the Straight Talk users know that the WiFi Hotspot is basically useless unless someone knows someway around it. I don't. However my LTE speeds are awesome! I've been getting around 20 to 28 just about all the time! Never was able to get them speeds on my LG G2 unless I was outside. I'm getting these fast speeds in my house! I can not praise the antennas on this phone enough. They are top of the line!!UPDATE: (2-11-16) Just thought I would let you guys know about a couple of tweaks I've used that seem to speed the phone up quite a bit. It does involve going into the developers options settings. If you're not sure how to get the dev settings all you do is go to about phone and tap on build number 5 or 6 times and it'll tell you that you're now a developer. Then back out to the settings and you should see developer options down by the about phone setting. Anyways I've enabled the Force GPU Rendering setting which may cost a little battery life but I'm not sure yet because I've just done it. I'll update if I notice any change in battery. But it seems to make the phone run so smooth. I've also changed all the animation settings that you will find in dev options to .5. This setting speeds up all the animations on the phone for a dramatically faster experience.So I Forced GPU Rendering and changed animation settings to .5 and my phone is running like a top!! Give it try and you'll see what I mean. I will update tomorrow about the GPU Rendering and if it does of doesn't eat more battery life. Until then those are the tricks I've tried for a better faster experience.P.S. Don't go changing any of the other dev option settings unless you know what you're doing.UPDATE: (2-12-16) So I've went through the day with the GPU rendering forced setting turned on in Dev options and it has not made any difference in my battery life. No better no worse but the phone is buttery smooth and with my animations on .5 it's twice as fast. I wishI would have known about these tweaks with some of my older slower phones! Folks these tweaks work and I haven't noticed them interfering badly with the phone at all. So give it a try and you will see. Also I have played around with the camera now quite a bit and while I won't go into the settings of the camera right now the pictures it takes are middle of the road. In good lighting the pics are fine, as long as you don't hold the same pic next to a more expensive phone like Iphone 5 or 6 or an LG G3 or Samsung S6. The camera on this phone isn't even close to as good as the one on my LG G2. In low light the pics aren't that good at all. I have seen worse but the camera really struggles in low light. In good lighting though the pics are fine for social media and things such as that but don't get this phone if you want a great camera.I agree with most of the other reviewers of this phone about the camera. Good lighting equals decent pictures but low lighting is going to equal low quality pictures which actually isn't the case on more expensive phones. I have still took some decent pics with this phone though so it's not all bad. Also mediocre camera and all this is the best phone on the market right now in it's price range and even a little above it's price range. It's just a great phone and anyone that says otherwise must have got a dud or just don't know a good phone when they see or use one. For this price there isn't a better phone in the American market. If you have any ?s for me leave them in the comment section and i'll try to help answer any of your ?s that i can. Thanks for reading my review. I will still be making updates as I go along using this phone.UPDATE: (2-23-16) Today the phone received a software update. Although it isn't the marshmallow update it does include January's security patch and improvements. I haven't really noticed anything different since the update other than the January security patch. It's still nice to see them update the phone in a timely manner. My LG G2 is still on Decembers security patch. Ifthey push a MM update out in a timely manner they will be winners in my book because they did what they said they would do, which a lot of phone companies do not.UPDATE (3-3-16) So I'm still loving my phone. I've got the window animations set to .5 and the force GPU rendering option turned on in developer settings and this phone is really fast! I'm super satisfied with this purchase. I've also noticed im getting so much better battery life with the GPU rendering turned on. If you haven't turned it on try it, you don't know what you're missing. It makes the phone buttery smooth. If you're still thinking of buying this phone go ahead and get it, do yourself a favor, you won't be disappointed!UPDATE (3-10-16)Today I just achieved5 hr. 15 min. of on screen time while my phone had been off the charger for 17 hr. 15 min.!!!! Still had 3% battery left! That is impressive. The battery on this phone continues to please me. I never worry about a mid-day charge. And that's with my screen brightness set on 68%! Just yet another reason for you to BUY this phone! I have also noticed that if I am out in the bright sun the text on the phone intensifies so I can see it better! You do have to turn that feature on in the settings though. So many nice features on this phone. I'm still finding out new things that this phone can do. Best phone I have had to date.UPDATE (3-11-16) HONOR is now accepting beta testers for the Marshmallow update! You can go to the Honor Community page to sign up if you would like to test the new update before it is released to the public. I've already signed up. Better hurry though, it's first come first serve! Honor is making good on their word of updating this phone in a timely manner. It makes you feel good knowing a company is doing what they said they would. I can't wait for Marshmallow!",2016年2月2日 在美国审核

Great phone for the price but with one huge flaw.,"Huawei *almost* hit one out of the park with this phone.It was time for me to upgrade after years of issues with the GPS on every version of the Samsung Galaxy Note (versions 1, 2, 3, 4 - all on ATT)After much research I finally pulled the trigger on this phone, knowing full well it was a mid range to budget phone.I was VERY impressed with the phone initially...-Sleek and sexy all metal body-Fingerprint scanner is very quick (I was always one who saw them as gimmicky, until this one.Having it on the back is great, except if you have a magnetic car holder like myself, then it's a bit annoying to have to take it off, unlock it, and put it back)-Bigger screen than I was expecting, just as big as my Note 4.If you want a small phone, this isn't the one for you! (See pic)-I was worried about the lower 1920x1080 (1080p) resolution, but honestly couldn't tell the difference between this screen and the Note 4's that has a higher resolution of 2560x1440 (1440p)-Camera takes great pics, focuses much faster than the Note 4-Huawei freely offers the unlock code to anyone who wants it (for those interested in rooting their phone)So after a couple weeks, I was very happy and feeling lucky that I had found such great, affordable phone... but then it all turned south in a hurry.Like most other smartphone owners, I had slapped on a screen protector and case on day 1.I took the phone out of the case to get all the dust and garbage out that collects between the two.That's when I noticed the phone wasn't lying flat on the table... on closer inspection, I was terrified to notice that the phone was actually bent so that two of the opposite corners were higher than the other two.Thankfully I was able to carefully bend it back to where it was flat again.(It seemed to be bending from the phone being in my back pocket while sitting, I'm a very average 160 lbs if you're curious)Nothing else seemed to be affected by the phone playing a yoga instructor, so I chalked it up to something I'd have to deal with due to it's price.Sadly, a few days later, I started noticing the phone mysteriously rebooting by itself.After a little troubleshooting, I noticed that the metal body had started to fatigue from all those yoga moves and bent to the point where it started pushing against the power button, causing it to stick (see pics).So while the phone is amazing for the price, this major flaw makes it unusable unless you decide to get a big, bulky case to help keep it rigid while in your pocket.This defeats the purpose of having a sleek phone in the first place.Huawei did return my email within 4 hours, but the rep did not have much in terms of solutions...here's a part of his email:""Thank you for contacting Honor support. Interesting, I can see how that is an issue. As for fixing an issue like this, that would be a problem. We currently don't have a repair center setup yet, even if we did that's an issue that we wouldn't be able to fix as it voids the warranty. I would highly suggest sending it to Amazon for a return or replacement before your warranty or buyers remorse is up.""Hopefully this helps everyone decide one way or another on this phone and please feel free to ask questions and I'll keep an eye out for them!UPDATE:I called Huawei Support (a rep asked me to do so in a reply to this review) and spoke to Chris at ext.44014. After asking me several times if I had dropped or otherwise damaged the phone, and me telling him that I've had the phone in a case since day 1, he basically implied that having the phone in my back pocket voids the warranty. WOW! I'd be furious if I didn't have the option to return it to Amazon. I'm sorry for keeping it my back pocket and damaging your phone, I must have missed those instructions in the fine print along with your less than stellar warranty policy.",2016年3月11日 在美国审核

A steal of a deal,"6 weeks ago, with great skepticism, I took a leap of faith and bought this phone as an upgrade from my previous phone- an iPhone 5S.I've intentionally waited to write a review so that I'd have time to really get to know the phone, and provide as honest a review as possible.To begin with, I'd consider myself an average smartphone user.I make a few calls a day, text/WhatsApp/Skype quite a bit, search Google regularly, read books on Kindle app, watch Youtube/Netflix/HBOGo often, check Facebook and Snapchat a couple times a day, do some banking, read news/sports/stocks, listen to music/podcasts (through headphones or bluetooth speaker), occasionally snap a photo or video, and of course use various other apps at any given time.Also, I travel quite a bit, so having an unlocked phone is something very important to me.That being said, and to my relief and joy, I'm yet to find this phone wanting!The UI is snappy and responsive and (if you're okay with iOS-like functionality) quite pleasant to use. The screen resolution at 1080p is fantastic!My wife has an iPhone 6s Plus and we often place our screens side by side playing HD video to compare.Our verdict is that is image qualities are equal -a win for the 5X given the price disparity between the two phones!Another feature that makes this phone particularly outstanding is the fingerprint sensor.It's perfectly placed on the back of the phone so that I can unlock the phone, and control the notifications panel as I pull it out of my pocket, without ever having to touch the screen.The convenience of it is a pleasant surprise, and I feel really sets this phone apart from other comparable phones like the Blue Vivo 5 (which I was also considering purchasing).The few cons:The camera is a bit weak in low light, but for my casual purposes at 13mp in back, and 5mp in front it works great.Also, though I don't do any 3D gaming myself, I've heard that the picture lags when trying to play graphics intensive games.TIP FOR A NICE SETUPI bought my Honor 5x along with:1) SPARIN 2 pack clear case- you gotta have a case.This one's nice because it doesn't add much bulk to the phone and shows off the beautiful metal body build.2) A Samsung 32gb microSD- the 5X comes with 16gb internal storage, so it's nice to add a bunch of extra space with a $10 microSD.3) An OMOTON 2 pack screen protector- the screen protector that comes on the phone gets the job done, but isn't smudge resistant.The OMOTON's are super oleophobic and keep the screen crystal clear and sharp looking.4) A cricket SIM card- it's much cheaper to buy any phone provider's SIM online, and you can also avoid the activation fees by activating online too.Overall I think the value packed into this phone can't be beat.I've enjoyed it so much that we even bought one for my mother in law who loves her's as well.In the end we got 2 Honor 5X's and all the accessories I mentioned above for a grand total of $445, nearly half the price of an unlocked iPhone 6s.Needless to say,this phone is a steal of a deal for any average smartphone user.The true test will be if this feature packed yet inexpensive smartphone can withstand the test of time.For that reason I'll be updating my review after 6 months, and 1 year of use.For now I'm enjoying the Honor 5X thoroughly, and would absolutely recommend it to any value minded shopper!",2016年5月5日 在美国审核

"very nice, and better with CyanogenMod","Bought a mint, used copy elsewhere for mother who is in her early seventies. The 5.5"" IPS display @401ppi, Snapdragon 616, 2GB memory, 16GB with SD expansion, and FINGERPRINT SCANNER are what sold me (and I snagged it for $144, shipped, several months ago). That's a serious bit of kit, for the money!Huawei's ""Emotion UI"" isn't too shabby, I don't think. It's a pretty close approximation to Apple's iOS, which might be of benefit to someone more familiar with the iPhone. Overall performance seemed fluid, and the phone is fully encrypted (owner must set this option in a menu). I recall reading the Snapdragon 616 has ""cryptographic acceleration"", so I guess there's some hardware offloading for AES..? All I can say is there was no apparent degradation in performance after setting up full encryption. Also, I think I recall some benchmarks suggesting the 616 is on the order of 20% faster than the popular 615.Screen is a fingerprint oil magnet. I added a cheap, oleophobic tempered glass screen protector, and that problem was immediately solved.General performance is good. Camera seems fine; images are a bit soft, but it performs better than I anticipated for the price. Don't forget, this is mom's phone, not mine, so my usage is fairly limited. I personally have a Note 5, and previously Note 4, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, and some older mid-level Android phones.Here's the ding: It's early December, 2016, and the last security update is from early May. For me, that's unacceptable.My recent solution was to flash with CyanogenMod 13, sans root. Now it has November's Android security patch (just like my Note 5), and everything seems to be working beautifully. I can download any available nightly updates and flash them with just a couple screen taps. I'm very pleased! I'm having similar success with CyanogenMod 14 on my Nexus 7 (2013) tablet that recently went end-of-life; that device now has December's Android security patch on Nougat, plus other CM14-specific goodies.Perhaps flashing is not for the faint of heart, but I followed the instructions on CyanogenMod's site with a Fedora 25 laptop and all went well.Excellent buy. Pretty much 5 stars for me, given CM is such a nice ROM. But I demand faster security patching from manufacturers, hence loss of one star.",2016年12月8日 在美国审核
Worst Phone Experience I've ever Had.,"I'll never buy an Honor device again.I excitedly updated to the B331 firmware (Android 6.0.1). I regretted it almost immediately. It came with a host of problems. Lag, stuttering, freezing. It made the device horrible, almost completely unusable.Honor must have realized how bad their update was because they release a rollback guideline to revert to an older firmware. I tried to complete this process several times. It would not work. I then contacted Customer Service and was led through the process again, it still did not work. After spending an hour with the Customer Service I was told I would have to send my device in for service, for a firmware issue NOT hardware. Not only that but they do not send out a replacement device.

Nice budget phone,"I purchased this phone about 8 months ago for $199 from another website.This phone is currently selling for much less than that and for that price, it is a nice phone.Good:It has everything I wanted at the time....fast finger print sensor, HD screen, great battery life, micro SD slot, and bands 2 4 and 12 for TMobile.Phone is sluggish sometimes but I would either restart the phone or use their ""PHONE MANAGER"" and close all background apps to get it going again.If you have used iphone 5s or higher and Galaxy S6 or higher...this phone will seem VERY slow to you, just FYI.Bad:This phone does not have that coating that prevents finger prints from clogging up the screen.Front camera is not good enough to use video chatting or selfies if it's even remotely dark.Overall, I'm still using this phone and am pretty satisfied so far.I am, however, shopping for an upgrade due to its sluggishness compared to my kids Galaxy s6's and iPhone 7's.I might look at either Honor 8 (refurbished) or used Galaxy S6 to replace this.",2017年2月22日 在美国审核
Good hardware but Terrible software and service.,"Update:Customer service is clueless about how to fix the update fiasco did to my phone.I followed the instruction from a HuaWei email posted by an anonymous forum member on Huawei's website and factory reset my phone. That fixed the problem. But you have to backup data first since it would erase all phone data.The factory reset did not roll back to Lollipop. It is still Marshmallow 6.01.The rude Huawei customer rep told me to downgrade to Lollipop. I am glad I didn't listen.Pro: inexpensive for its size and powerCon: software.I was planning to give a 5 star until its latest update completely erased my data. What is worse is that it claimed that it won't erase my data before the upgrade starts and then went ahead and deleted everything.What is even worse is that now my internal storage is shown as 2GB while it was supposed to be 16 GB. As a result, I can't install any new apps.When I call customer service, I got a snooty representative that simply told me that they are aware this storage bug and will push update to my phone in a few days. When I ask him whether the new update would delete my data, he simply said he didn't know.Don't give me the excuse that Android is responsible for the bug. I did a manual install of Marshmallow downloaded from Huawei website and it worked perfectly without deleting anything from my phone.It is Huawei who pushed the wrong update to my phone and completely broke the storage system and deleted my data. Now I am hopping mad.Still can't beat the price though.Oh. I must echo earlier review about the incredibly low volume of the speaker phone, If I can't make a call hands free using the speaker phone during driving, it failed its primary functionality and it is much worse than my 20 dollar smart phone before this.",2016年8月8日 在美国审核

"I'm never paying $600 for a Reddit, FB, texting slab again","I've been on a T-Mobile Jump plan pretty much since it started. And what happens every time is that I get bored with my phone after 8 months, only to find out that I have to pay another $150 on it ($25/month for the payment, $12/month for insurance) before I can upgrade. My latest was a V10. The phone was pretty fun at first, but eventually it's just a phone. And that $37/month just keeps ticking. I decided I was getting out.I took a lot of time choosing my phone, looking at the Blu Vivo 5, the Alcatel Idol3, and Sony Xperia XA. In the end, the 5X's fingerprint scanner and 1080p screen won it out for me. Plus I got it for $159 from Best Buy.I was worried that the lesser processor and 2GB of RAM wouldn't compare at all to the 4GB and Snapdragon 8-series in the V10, but I was wrong. EMUI (started with Lollipop, but Marshmallow upgrade was immediate) was alright. Once I rooted and installed CM13, everything works almost as well as the V10. Apps lag a little in start up (3-5 seconds), and if I have 38 apps open, it starts to crawl. But swapping back and forth between Reddit, Facebook, Insta, Chrome and text messaging is super smooth once they're open.The camera is serviceable (though a 4:3 sensor instead of 3:2), and the battery is a beast. I typically had to recharge my V10 at around 8pm daily to make it through the night, but this thing typically hits 15% around midnight, on an average day. The fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate, even with CM installed. I'm pretty certain I'm never paying $600 for a Reddit, FB, texting slab again.",2016年9月9日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price!,"I have been using the Honor 5x for a week now. My first impression of the phone upon opening it was that this is a very attractive phone. It looks and feels very high end. I love the fact that it has a real brushed aluminum back. Also the Honor 5x is very thin. As for the performance of the phone I have no complaints. It seems to run and operate very well for my needs. Now I am not a gamer and do not push the phone very hard. In fact I am more of a novice and probably not qualified to rate the more technical aspects of this phone, but for my casual use this phone works great. The screen is nice and a step up from my Motorola Moto E. The same goes for the cameras. Although I don't take a lot of pictures, the few I have taken the picture quality seems pretty good. I do have a couple complaints though. First the screen visibility in direct sunlight is less than desirable. Now I have read a lot of reviews saying that the screen in direct sunlight is really good and while it is definitely better than my old phone, it's still hard to see. Secondly (and this is actually a pretty big problem for me) is the screen/power button location. It is located on the right side of the phone when looking at the screen, just below the volume up/down. My Motorola has the power button on the right side of the phone also except it is above the volume buttons toward the top of the phone. Now on this phone with it being below the volume buttons it's right about in the middle of the phone and I am always accidentally hitting the button. That can be quite annoying.Well now it's only been a week, but so far I really like this phone and would recommend it especially for the price. If anything changes I'll update.",2016年7月23日 在美国审核
"Maybe a good first phone? or ""Okay at best""","This phone, for the price I paid on Prime Day, is okay at best. A metal build means nothing to me, other than wasted money, it's kept in a case always. It has terrible GPS, no gyro, no NFC, no removable battery(rare these days, but I miss it), terrible cell reception(although I have noticed cell reception getting worse on all phones I've used, If I need good reception, I use my old cell from a couple of years ago it works much, much better. It's my 2nd phone with a fingerprint scanner and that I like. Screen is okay, but I like the 720p amoled screen on the blu vivo 5 much better. Battery life is nothing to write home about, I usually charge it over night and again mid to late afternoon. Speaker isn't very nice sounding, but is adequate. Glad it has Marshmallow, but don't care for Huawei's version. It is not smooth at all, lag and frame drop constantly, can't even keep multiple apps running, many times restarting apps supposedly running in background. If I had to pay full price, I'd keep looking. But as a temporary phone for the price I paid, it's okay at best.Thought I'd add, this phone also takes a long time to charge, and wifi conductivity is not the latest or greatest.",2016年8月5日 在美国审核
Unequivocal approval !!!!  pull the trigger on this model or the 6x.,"I am more pleased with this than I was with my first introductory android phone, an entry-level HTC ($89). Get what U pay for. I hear the HTC's are great phones, with the better models. I didn't consider them because I didn't know any better.The Honor 5x is as good as my last iPhone 5C, and probably better.I gave up on 7 years with the iOS environment for various reasons, software glitches, and hardware failures. The HTC was my first experience with android, not pleasant. However, I was determined to stick with Android. I loved the freedom of being unlocked and not confined to a fixed environment that was claustrophobic. I no longer required Apple to hold my hand with a bullet proof system, and I was fed up with their softly, pedaled arrogance. Their captured herd of followers. But it is a system that lulls you to sleep with reliability until it fails. I gambled on the Honor when I discovered they were involved in producing the google nexus. I figured if the Huawei connection was good enoughfor Google, it was for me.I've been very pleased with the upgrade to superior hardware and the seamless software environment. No matter what utility app I load and use. It works without a hitch.I've owned the Honor for approximately 8 months. Great value for the price.",2017年2月2日 在美国审核
I hate this phone,"I hate this phone. I didn't want to hate it, but I do.The phone is s l o w, it crashes and freezes constantly, often restarts itself in the middle of a task, takes literally a day to charge, and lags between or during app usage. It does not matter what energy setting I have the phone on, what apps are installed or what SD card is or is not installed, it just will not behave. Worse yet may be the support. I have both called and emailed the company and the advice given to me has been useless, repetitive, or just inaccurate. I suppose I will save up my money and go back to Samsung.I do have to say though, the phone is quite durable and attractive. So... it has that going for it. I think if you just wanted an unlocked phone that had a decent camera and could handle basic things like google searches and emails, this is the phone for you. HOWEVER if you like snapchat, instagram, facebook messenger, games, etc and expect to be able to switch back and forth between apps and still have your phone responsive, this might not be the device for you!

Great price at $120 but I would not buy for $200,"I get really poor call quality on ATT with this device. Calls drop constantly and using bluetooth or speakerphone both irritate whoever I am calling. Even when using handset earpiece callers tell me I sound garbled and am cutting in and out in places that had perfect reception on my previous devices. The Huawei UI sucks more than stock Android. The phone does freeze on occasion and Android + UI use 1GB of RAM (50%) with no apps running. The LCD looks dull and washed out. Might be hard to notice for many but the color gamut looks a kinda sickly and greenish compared to other devices, even with the color temperature set warm. The camera is indeed sorta poor as others have mentioned, any motion in images comes out blurry even in sunlight. Many technical diagnostics apps do not work such as apps that measure signal quality, which I wanted to use to see why my calls are so poor. Still no Android 6 as promised, 7 months later from Huawei's announcement. I paid only $120 on prime day but will probably still return it. Bummer as my screen protector and case is already on the way. I love the idea of an inexpensive unlocked phone with an SD card slot, but this one in execution is not too hot. I still gotta praise Huawei though as this is the start of the commoditization of smart phones. There will be many more great and inexpensive models to come.",2016年7月19日 在美国审核
Suggested Update Wipes Phone- no response to customers from manufacturer,"Update: I had to take my rating down a couple stars because an update yesterday wiped my phone and set the phone back to the factory settings when I'd already painstakingly set my personal preferences and installed the apps I use. Many people on the user blog have had the same issue and others as well. The only solution that users have found has been to do a factory reset on the phone. There is a lot of frustration out thereandI am among those that are now unhappy.The Huawei supportteamhas not respondedto anyone as far as I can tell.Please keepthis in mind when you're making your purchase. If you already are a user, do not install the update when you get the notification.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So many pros! Screen is bigger than other fruit 6 compared side by side. Can handle many apps at once. Love the temperature screen adjustment from cool (blue) to a warm (golden) for day to night. 5 different fingerprint reader controls, 2 of which I used as screen unlocks, one left hand, one right hand. The screen can minimize for one handed use with just a quick left or right swipe-great for small hands.Cons, there are functions that are only accessible while the screen is locked, which seems irrational to me. The biggest drawback is that there's no voice announce for caller names and reading aloud of SMS, a function that is vital for me. I also miss the app drawer.

The Good and The Bad with the H5X,"I purchased this phone on prime day for $100 (part of the reason I've given it 4 stars has to do with the insane value of what you're getting for the money) but there are plenty of drawbacks. The biggest problem with this phone is the lack of ram. On the original listing, it said this phone had 3gb of ram but was later updated to say 2gb -- apparently there is another version of the 5X that has extra ram, hence the listing error. Anyway, I'll break this down for you:Pros: Value/Price, Camera, Biometrics, Screen Resolution, Aluminum Casing, 128gb expandable memory, DUAL-SIM is awesome and a big part of why I bought this phone.Cons: Updating OS is not easy, the UI is problematic, the phone has way too little RAM for the software/hardware needs, phone lags regularly with minimal apps, requires active background task management but does not include any ram optimization with their ""custom UI or custom apps"" - custom UI and custom apps that come with the phone are basically worthless and waste vital resources. Every couple of days the lag can get so bad that the screen will freeze black for a couple minutes before a complete task-wipe can be performed.",2016年12月6日 在美国审核

Upgraded to EMUI 4.0 with marshmallow, even better, fast and smooth performance, apps works fine. Place and extra SD card and voilá, plenty space for photos, videos, apps, you named it. My highlights are:- Camera: 13 Mp rear facing takes excellent photos and fluid video, works fast and accurate. 5 Mp front facing takes good pictures, works fine with skype.- Construction: beautiful metal casing and gorilla glass, resistant and durable so far, no scratches and solid, steady on the surfaces.- Connectivity: load my band 4 LTE SIM card carrier and fast connection, fluid voice and data transfer.- Screen: brilliant display, crisp and brilliant photos, smooth video and games.- Sound: just one speaker but it does the work just fine, loud enough under normal conditions.Overall: great deal, excellent phone for the price.

"Great for the price, but if you put a lot of stress on your phone spend more","For the price this is an excellent phone. That being said, it is at the lower end of the spectrum. As it only has 2GBs of ram I find myself constantly clearing my applications, and even then it seems to be running fairly slowly at times. With that, for the price this is a great phone.- The finger print scanner is surprisingly accurate and quick.- The screen itself is pretty responsive.- The screen is clear and easy to read.- The camera is alright, definitely does not compare to a Nokia- Many program take a little while to start upOverall I would recommend this phone to anyone on a budget, but not to someone that can afford to spend more on something like the new Galaxy or the latest Nokia flagship phone for those that like the Windows interface.Lastly, even though this has more RAM than most iPhones, keep in mind that iOS is not the same as Android Operating Systems.

Best Value Phone on the Market (Because it isn't a value phone),"I bought this phone mostly because it was on sale for $120 for my sister's birthday to replace her aging Moto X. Four months in I still hear her talking about how much she loves her new phone. The best part about this phone is obviously the price, but more importantly it's the value that even the normal $200 price tag gets you. You get a Snapdragon processor that isn't as powerful as the 820 but is more efficient and can handle almost anything you throw at it. You get a full 5.5"" 1080p HD screen that is absolutely gorgeous and handles colors extremely well. You get a fingerprint sensor that isn't just a gimmick and actually works really well. You get a 13 MP rear camera that takes excellent photos (not iPhone or Samsung quality but better than any $200 phone I have ever used) paired with a 5 MP selfie camera that gets the job done. Finally, you get a very nice metal casing that may not cover the front of the phone but successfully makes you wonder how the heck they are selling this for $200. When I first got my hands on a Moto G in 2014 I thought that it was insane to be selling a phone this nice at the $200 price point, and that was a plastic piece of crap with a 4.5 in 720p screen and a 5 MP rear camera with no finger print sensor to be found. To be selling this phone at $200 is just ludicrous. This phone can easily be a daily driver for 99% of the people out there and honestly most would consider it an upgrade to what they have right now.

No more $700 iPhones or Android phones for me,"This phone is an incredible deal for the price and I cant get over how smooth and usable it is.The phone already has a Marshmallow 6.0.1 update available (which is really nice) and the update improves the phone even more in how it manages apps and the screens and the battery, among many other things.I am kind of a phone junky and started with iPhones, went to Androids for a while back when the operating system was developing and a little frustrating.I then switched back to the iPhone 6S.Comparing this Honor 5X to a 6S is not fair, the 6S has a lot more horsepower but this phone does everything the 6S does except for pure graphics and processing speed.I am a heavy app user on the Honor 5X and still have not hit a performance wall where I am complaining about speed. I put a high quality 128GB microSD in the phone and the transfer rate between internal and the external SD is very fast (much faster than the Galaxy S5.)Unlocking and rooting was fairly easy so I can do even more with the phone but rooting is not necessary.Overall, WOW!Good job Huawei.....This phone should be plenty for 95% of the public and is an amazing device.",2016年8月26日 在美国审核
Worst OS ever,"I have used this phone for just about a year. Everyday the phone requires a reboot at least once due to the keyboard disappearing all the time, freezing, or just plain won't even appear when you click on some sort of field. Phone does not properly use the SD card; almost impossible to find data that was written to the card from a desktop. I have to email files to my phone, despite having it connected to the laptop for transfer. Cannot disable the behavior that when the front camera is blocked, a pop up appears that won't let you use the phone until it's removed (yet they provide a message that you can disable it; it has yet to work). Forced updates on the phone regardless of what type of access method you are using to get online. Horrible, HORRIBLE, UI.

Update: the fingerprint scanner doesn't work anymore, completely failed and no longer registers.I wouldn't even buy it if it was under $75. Highly don't recommend this phone. Get a Moto G (4th gen).

Truly an amazing device! Solid build!,"When I was offered this phone, I started researching the company. Everyone at the time said they never heard of Honor and that they would pass on it. Little did people know Honor is the phone made by Huawei and they happen to be in the top three cell phone companies after Apple and Samsung. They designed the Google Nexus 6P.You can’t compare this phone to an Apple; Apple is a higher priced phone. I wanted to compare it to BLU but BLU is a lower end phone. It reminds me a lot of my LG G4, but the LG4 is more expensive. However, I have found I am using the Honor 5X more and it is my go to device lately. Out of the box, it feels solid in your hands. I love that it comes with a protector screen already on the phone because I am terrible at applying them. As far as cases, I ordered two and both cases were not sturdy enough to protect the phone. I am hoping with time more cases will become available. I have one of them on the phone but it does not offer much protection.The fingerprint sign in is nice. However, I have noticed an issue with it. The first time I set it up it took for two days then stop reading my finger. After so many attempts, it locks you out for ten seconds and will ask you to try again. I then decided to change the fingerprint and it worked again for another two days. Now it seems it works, or it doesn’t. I am not sure why. If it does not read the fingerprint, it will ask for my passcode which is a backup. I am now finding myself using the number code since the fingerprint does not seem to work.Battery life is amazing with this device! I have tried so hard to drain the battery on this and can’t. I spent nights installing several apps and watching movies and the battery was still charged. I haven’t drained the battery, and I have tried. The battery truly is amazing. I know some people do not like that you cannot remove the battery but that is not an issue for me. I have other devices I can’t remove the battery and accept that it is part of the phone.I have installed Netflix, Pandora, Amazon Music, Alexa on it, they all work great. In order to get Amazon videos, you have to use the underground app and install it through the web on the device. Once I did that, I am now watching my Prime movies and other Amazon subscription with ease. This is the device I like to watch movies on. The picture is vibrant and the sound is great!The camera has a lot of applications that the LG G4 has and also some of the newer iOS devices. You have the beauty part which will probably apply for to the ladies. You can add a beauty filter and the thinning of the face, blemish removal, you name it. It has a food setting which is nice for taking pictures if you cook. I love the camera and all of the settings. I have used it to record video and have been very impressed. I automatically back up all my photos to my Amazon Cloud drive as well.This thing is fast as well. I have the latest Apple Touch and even though I did not want to compare it to an Apple device, the Honor is so much faster! I have not had it lock up on me or freeze.This phone is truly amazing. I love it! I have been using it for weeks and am more impressed with it today than the day I first received it.",2016年2月17日 在美国审核
Amazing!,"When honor announced the 5x I was surprised by the build quality and price. Blu threw a curve ball when they released the vivo xl for $99 bucks. I opted to buy the vivo xl. After having the vivo xl for a week I could not live with out a fingerprint scanner. I bought the honor 5x on eBay today and I am blown away but at the same time disappointed by the UI performance. Compared to the vivo xl, navigating around the UI, the honor 5x is very laggy. Both are heavily skinned, and both are running lollipop. I do enjoy emui better than the vivo xl skin. I also enjoy having soft keys on my phone capacitive buttons. The vivo xl also does not have backlights on their buttons which annoyed me a ton, also the arrangements of the buttons. Do not know why blu decided to change the order of the OEM Android buttons. The fingerprint scanner on the honor 5x is very quick. Faster than the Samsung s6 and iPhone 6s plus scanner. I do not mind emui, looks very nice(rip off of ios). I do like the button shapes and icons. I usually download Google's messaging app but the honor 5x default app is very nice and I like how the sms threads are designed. You can scroll between dialer, contacts, and messages all in one app. The screen is nice and sharp but not as vibrant as the vivo xl. The vivo xl uses an amoled display but only at 720p. The build quality if the honor 5x is at another level compared to the vivo xl. The vivo xl is cheap plastic on the back and a metal body. The honor 5x is a combination of metal and plastic(minimal). Many reviewers are complaining about the screen being a fingerprint magnet but buying a screen protector will help a ton. Overall I must admit both phones are great but for the extra $80 bucks I got a 1080p display, metal body phone, and a finger print scanner. I do not care that it does not have nfc. Have not used Android pay or apple pay once. USB c doesn't affect me....I have a ton of micro USB cables laying around. I am pleased with my purchase so far.

"Exceptional value, but not for everyone.","The phone is incredible for the price especially if you bought it on prime day for $120. With that said, it is still a budget device and the performance will not satisfy everyone. I bought it on prime day with intentions of having it as a backup and flashing custom ROMs at some point. I've used it as my daily driver for almost a month now and I have had a mostly positive experience. The positives: really good battery life, awesome display, decent finger print scanner and dual sim. The negatives: the software isn't great, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it's still not something that I liked. It's also fairly laggy. It is a budget phone with a budget processor so this was expected. I could tolerate it for the most part but I personally prefer the silky smoothness of stock Android. That is why I have switched back to my trusty nexus 5 (which I am writing this review on). I'm impatiently awaiting the new nexus lineup to be announced and plan on getting one of those if I like what they put out. If not, I'm probably going to get last year's nexus 6p.

Nice for a budget phone! Bought it on sale and it was a good value for the price I paid!,"I bought this phone as a Prime Day Deal when it was only ~$120. I switched from a first gen Moto X to the Honor 5x because my Moto X battery was failing.Pros- Love the fingerprint detector! I didn't really think the fingerprint reader would work very well or be a game changer, but it's actually very convenient to unlock the phone with my finger.- The screen has stood up to my rough and frequent use and came with a preinstalled screen protector- The camera is great! It's easier to use and takes better pictures than my first gen Moto X. I like having a button I can press to snap a photo instead of just tapping anywhere- The top control panel gives easy access to several settings- The front facing camera does a nice job and includes a skin brightening/blurring feature so I can convince people I'm better looking than I actually am- The phone is reasonably fast for a budget phone. It opens apps and allows for quick web surfing-The battery life is so much better! I can go an entire day of constant use without having to recharge. I use this phone nonstop from 10 am to 3 am and it is able to handle it. (Except when I play Pokemon Go, but that's not the 5X's fault)Cons- Screenshotting takes forever. It is incredibly slow and this is one thing that drives me bonkers with this phone.- After some recent updates, apps like Chrome and Snapchat seems to be malfunctioning frequently. It's been like this for a couple weeks. The phone seems to struggle with them sometimes.- Dismissing notifications can sometimes interfere with the app that the notification is coming from.- I wish the default OS had an app drawer instead of leaving everything out all over the screen. You can download launchers to change this, but then you lose some of the 5X's cool features.Overall, this is not bad for a cheaper phone. Would I like the newest, fastest phone? Well yeah. Am I willing to pay for the newest, fastest phone? No way. Would I get this much bang for my buck elsewhere? Probably not.",2016年8月25日 在美国审核
Great Mid-Price phone,"Girlfriend loves it. It does everything it is supposed to do. Works on MetroPCS network (uses T-Mobile).I was able to quickly force upgrade the UI and Android OS to Marshmallow after finding it online and it works like a charm.I use LG G4 H810 from AT&amp;T and am disappointed in it as its build quality is absolutely unreliable. I only mention this because I really like LG's UI skin over Android. It does a bunch. This UI does leave something to be desired in comparison. No widgets and it just doesn't fully use all of Android's capabilities.However, it is a solid and fast phone. It works and I got it on Prime Day for $100 so yeah it is great. With the money saved I put in a 64GB card and a cool case (there are a bunch that fit this one), a couple of battery banks and a screen protector.",2016年8月10日 在美国审核
Best Budget Smartphone,"I'll start off by stating that I got this on Amazon Prime Day at 40% off for $120. At that price I would recommend anyone to buy this phone. At the regular price of $200, you would be hard-pressed to find a better alternative to this. Let's start by stating the positives:Surprisingly quick and useful finger print sensorExtremely useful fingerprint motion controls1080p screenIPS displayAll aluminum design with rounded edgesOctacore processor2gb ramAlthough some of the specs might seem low, it's to be remembered that this phone is only $200, $120 in my case. The snapdragon 616 is power efficient and has plenty of power to push the 1080p IPS display. The fingerprint sensor is quick and bypasses the lock screen, meaning you dont have to turn on your phone to unlock it. For the price, 2gb of ram is refreshing, especially when I upgraded from .5gb of ram. The Honor 5X won't keep every app you open in memory, but if you're a decent human being, you could close your apps like other people and won't complain about memory issues. Now let's list the negatives:CameraScreen protectorLock screenWhile I know the 13 megapixel shooter performs well in decent lighting, in dark or low light scenarios, the phone struggles. There is a lot of grain in dark photos and some noticeable grain in low light photos. The f2.0 aperture is also somewhat disappointing, an f1.8 sensor would be much better be a 2.0 is sufficient and at $120 (40% off) is acceptable. Another gripe I have I'd the screen protector, do yourself a favor and order tempered glass along with the phone. The screen protector that comes shipped with the phone is decent at best, but scratches extremely easily. The first day of having the phone, it scratched in my pocket and now has many noticeable scratches and scuffs on the screen. Another thing I hate but is ground breaking is that the phone only seems to allow it's own Huawei music player a lock screen control screen. I've tried several other music players, including Poweramp, and none seem to work, even with lock screen permissions enabled. But that's just with me.Overall this phone is an excellent buy at $200, even more so than the Blu phones priced similarly. Some things I would recommend: buy a screen protector or tempered glass along with the phone, buy an SD card as well, and update to Android Marshmallow so you can really take advantage of that and card, especially since it can support up to a 128gb SD card.",2016年7月28日 在美国审核
for the normal price this phone is an amazing deal and for the sale price on Prime day ...,"I bought this during the Prime Day sale since I needed a holdover phone for a while. I went in fully prepared for this to be a compromise and ready to sacrifice features I was used to. But now that I've had it for a bit over a week I have to say, for the normal price this phone is an amazing deal and for the sale price on Prime day it's an absolute steal. I was ready to root this thing and put a custom rom on it to get it working the way I wanted but after applying Huawei's newest update, which brings the phone up to Android 6.0.1 &amp; changing the launcher from the default to Nova Launcher, I have no desire to either root or put a custom rom on the phone, it just doesn't seem worth the trouble.Performance &amp; Features:The phone runs flawlessly for everything I do, which admittedly is mostly flipboard, random web browsing and watching an occasional youtube video and then the typical day to day texting &amp; checking email, etc. that leads me to battery life, which is excellent on this phone. So far not only have I not had a single day in which I’ve had to charge before going to bed but that includes one day in which I went from waiting room to waiting room all day for about 12 hours and had the phone on with music streaming almost the entire time, the phone barely made it that day but it still had about 10% battery life by bed time that night. The last big point for me is the fingerprint reader. For the low price point that this phone hits, just having a fingerprint reader is surprising but the fact that it works flawlessly and is almost instant is even more of a surprise. I didn’t thing the fingerprint feature would do much for me and expected it to be more of a gimmick than anything but it works great and is much more convenient than typing in a pin or unlock pattern.Value:I’ve touched on this already but this phone is an amazing deal at the normal $200 price point and if you were lucky enough to get it on prime day in my opinion it’s an absolute steal. Not only am I happy with my purchase but I feel like this phone was an improvement in pretty much every way from my previous, now 2 year old flagship phone that I paid $600 for at the time. If I broke this phone tomorrow and had to buy it again at the full price, I would not hesitate.",2016年7月31日 在美国审核
Has Crippled Version of Marshmallow - Does not Have Adoptable Storage,"Warning - although Huawei claims that the device will have Marshmallow - it is not a fully featured version of Marshmallow.The great thing about Marshmallow for a device with a small memory such as this one is that it allows you to insert an SD card, and phone will treat the SD card as part of a single integrated memory for the phone.This is called Adoptable Storage.Huawei decided to strip that capability out of its version of Marshmallow - so you will be stuck with 16 GB of system memory total.Huawei is being deceptive in advertising Marshmallow, but not telling you that one of the most important aspects of Marshmallow for a 16 GB phone is not functional in its version of Marshmallow.On the other hand, if you are the type that likes to mess with alternative ROMs, Cyanogenmod seems to work very well, and has the adoptable storage fully functioning.However, that is not a realistic option for most people",2016年8月13日 在美国审核
"Nice camera and screen, for the price, a bargain","I got this phone because I could no longer justify paying a high monthly bill and I really don't need an iPhone at this point. What I wanted was a substitute phone that would allow me to buy my own sim and minutes and decide just how much time/data I needed without another bill coming. In terms of data minutes I'm not sure it saves that much (depending on your plan), but when it comes to not getting another monthly bill, amen.First of all, the phone has a very substantial feel. I had a Samsung s5 and, to be honest, for what I'm using this for (I'm not an app hog, most of what I use is basic and most is related to photography) and I really don't see a major difference between the two (again, in terms of what I use it for--taking pictures, talking and Google searches at my local cafe). After seeing several reviews from CES (all of which were pretty good), I decided it was worth testing.I'm a photographer and while I don't shoot that much with a cell camera, this 13mp camera is great. I got tons of banding in the sky (particularly in lowlight with the S5) and I get almost none with this. I'm not sure if that's a chip thing (I think so) or a software thing, or both. But either way, the camera is very good quality--and let's face it, with some of the photo apps out there, it's the gateway to doing almost anything you want (including time-lapse, which I love).Also the screen quality is superb. Funny, because I had read some bad reviews of other phones from the parent company of Honor and so I wasn't expecting much, but the screen quality is great.Some other reviewers (here and elsewhere) have talked about the difficulty of having to kick-start certain apps each time you use them, or to go hunt for them, but so far everything I've set up seems to be right there. But I'm not 15, so shuffling through apps is not second nature to me and I'm probably plodding along at a far slower speed in locating them than I need to regardless of what phone I'm using.Anyway, the phone is still pretty new to me, but I have to think that considering the price, the quality of the screen and the camera and the ability to buy my own time, this is a pretty respectable phone. As soon as I get a half dozen decent photos, I'll post a little gallery (here and on my main site).",2016年2月5日 在美国审核
Excellent budget phone that feels like premium,"I have used this phone for only a week, but I am really liking it. I got this phone on the prime day sale and couldn't be happier. The metal body feels solid. Finger print scanner works well. 16g internal flash is good enough with external SD slot. The 5.5"" display is sharp and easy on the eyes. The recent marshmallow update is the icing on the cake. You just download it from Huawei's website and there are instructions to update. Otherwise send them an email and they will help you push the OTA update to your device. It does improve battery life. With its decent 3000mah battery, marshmallow takes it to more than a day on single charge. I have moved from iPhone to this device and won't go back. The octa core processor with 2G RAM is more than enough for most apps. The dual SIM is really handy when you travel to another country. Last but not the least, the 13MP camera takes really good photos. Just make sure your photos and videos are saved on the SD card. This is an excellent phone overall for the money and beats the Moto hands down.",2016年7月23日 在美国审核
The $600 question.....or is it $200,"This is a fantastic unlocked phone at the price point, I purchased two of these for the wife and I switching from an iPhone 5s. Now for starters switching from an iPhone 5s to this the number one obstacle was the screen size but it went a lot smoother than one would think easier for me since I have larger hands but my wife who does not got used to it relatively quickly. Second obstical was the OS, EMUI hate it or love it was the perfect skin for previous iPhone users to get accustomed to, with no lag in sight.Cameras: The rear facing camera on this device is excellent in good light and so so in low light but good none the less (see attached photos) front facing camera is nothing to write home about but it does what it is intended to do. Note the default 13mp for the rear is 4:3 and to get 16:9 you'll have to switch to the 10mp option.Screen: The screen on this phone is excellent, gets bright when you need it to and gets dim when you need it to. And at 1080x1920 (1920x1080) media consumption is great. Color reproduction is also very nice for this ips display. Also a screen protector comes pre-installed so that's another thing I don't have to think about.Call quality / earphone: on AT&amp;T's network I've had great call quality with no dropped calls and good signal wherever I go (Southwestern Ohio) The earphone is also great getting a little too loud at some times. The speakerphone also gets loud but in the car and with loud toddlers (which I have) it probably isn't up to snuff. Callers also said that they could hear me very well on the other end with no choppiness or static.Battery: in my opinion this is the best quality of this device I've gone two days before charging the device with moderate use but you will no doubt get a full day of heavy use. This to me is a reason alone to buy coming from and iPhone where I had to charge mid afternoon to make it through the day.Storage: 16gb internal after OS and the usual apps from Google and huawei leaves you at around 10ish gb, but this is where the micro SD slot comes into play with support of up to 128gb making storage a non issue.Fingerprint scanner: easy and fast setup and works perfectly every time. Also there are helpful things that you can do with it in regards to pulling down notifications, front back and many others that I haven't gotten into.Build quality: on par with my old iPhone and feels great in the hand no problems here.For $200 do yourself a favor and get this phone if you are in the market you can't go wrong.",2016年3月2日 在美国审核

Great Product! Prime day steal and still a good deal on sale.,"Highly recommend for anyone who wants to get started into the Android experience. I got mine on Prime day for $125 with an Omotion glass screen cover, Tudia Merge dual case, and a Sandisk 128GB microSD card for a total of $180 and it turns the feel of the phone from cheap to premium immediately. The included cover on the phone is plastic and collects oil, this is a huge and inexpensive upgrade. I get compliments from people and when I tell them how much it costed me, they just have no words. My sisters Samsung S5 was a little snappier and had a better colored screen but this performs about as good for most things except heavy gaming, we play Pokemon Go together and it's worth it if you want a cheap phone that still has great features (some of those really cheap $50-70 phones are awful my friend has one, super slow). Also put Android 6.0+ on it, works great. The EMUI is also fantastic, I love it, looks nice, and the HSuite makes putting files, installing apk, and import/export media super easy.",2016年9月5日 在美国审核
"It works, but lacks some finesse.","If you want a basic smart phone, it works.If you want a good smartphone with an intuitive user-interface and easy-to-use features, this is lacking.A couple example annoyances I experienced in normal usage: 1. If you turn vibration off in silent mode, it will re-enable itself once you leave silent mode. Instead of using the volume buttons, you must go through the menus every time you want your phone completely silent. 2. HiVoice (apparently Huawei's parallel to Siri and similar) will continually ask permissions until you grant them. If you are like me and prefer to not use these apps (and thus deny their permissions when given the option), it will instead continually pop up messages reminding you it doesn't have permissions. There are also a stunning number of app notifications that I don't care to be reminded about.Transferring files to/from the phone and computer is also a pain as it is done through Huawei's software rather than just treating the phone as a USB storage device.If my old Moto G hadn't had an unfortunate accident involving hard asphalt, I'd go back to using it in a heartbeat.Still, this does function sufficiently as a smartphone.",2016年10月25日 在美国审核
AMAZING......for the price.,"TLDR: Awesome phone, worth $200 FOR SURE. You will get a well built phone that has the latest version of Android and does everything you need it to, and fast! Plus the screen and design of the phone is beautiful. Feels very thin in the hand but sturdy at the same time.Bought on Prime day for $120. that price must have been a mistake. This phone is better then the Moto g4 which was $159 and came with lock screen ads. The phone has great build quality and comes with a screen protector. I'm terrible at putting those on myself so it was nice to see a factory apply done that was perfect.....but.... I recommend buying a separate one as mine started to get bubbly after a day or two. I recommend the Spigen tempered glass one. It gives the phone's screen a rounded quality that is breathtaking.The phone is really quick and has great performance even under intense multi-tasking. My only qualm is the stock Huawei EMUI that comes pre-installed. If this phone had stock android It would be the absolute perfect phone. The UI isn't all bad but it does consume a lot of RAM which could be better used elsewhere for even better performance. My phone just updated to Android Marshmallow so the optimization has gotten better.",2016年7月21日 在美国审核
Good phone for a basic user,"It's not the best phone if you are used to having a ""nice"" phone. It's great for someone who doesn't bounce back and forth between apps or wants to use a phone to its maximum potential. I would recommend it if you needed a new, inexpensive phone and didn't care much about how well the system runs. For me it has just been frustrating to use. Especially if it's plugged in, you cannot use it (text, apps, etc.) or it goes haywire. I find myself often clearing all the active programs so it can run better/faster. It's not a bad phone - great battery, decent picture, comprehensive features and system -but I won't purchase it again when I'm ready to get a new phone.",2017年5月30日 在美国审核
Great Bang for your buck,"I wanted to spend a little time with this phone before reviewing it. I am a adult user, so I really didn't need a flagship phone. I use my phone for calls, some text messages ( mostly from my children, or work related ), because I work in the field I do use the GPS a lot. While sitting in the doctors office or other appointments I may play a game or read something. Now that you know about me, the phone review. I'll start with the finger print reader, it responds well and I like the placement of it. The screen is good enough for me to see in most situations. The volume is good. Fit and finish could be better, but is still satisfactory. Style points here, this is a great looking phone. Call quality is also good. Battery last about a day and a half for my use. The camera in the front is acceptable, the rear camera is great as long as you are not taking pictures in the middle of the night with no light around. I don't have a problem with the user interface, and really don't miss the app drawer. Finger print gestures are a life saver. I may update this review after I upgrade to marshmallow.

unbeatable price for a very good phone,"I got this as a backup work phone (normally use an iPhone) and am very impressed by the features you get for the price.Here's a quick list of my favorite features:✤It has a really sleek metal case with sort of rounded edges that give it a nice feel in the hand (if you use without a case, anyway).✤ The screen is very sharp and bright and comparable to high-end phones.✤ The fingerprint sensor works surprisingly well and opens the phone quickly.✤ It has lots of card slots, which was a change from the iPhones I'm used to.This means you can add memory and swap SIM cards in and out with ease.✤ The phone itself is pretty fast -- not quite as fast as my iPhone 6, but still pretty fast.Of course it runs Android and a lot depends on the programs/games you run, but this is no laggard.✤ The camera is decent but not great.✤The battery life is great but it takes a long time to charge.✤ In general, the workmanship and design seem very good, especially for this price point.✤Let me say it again: THE PRICE IS RIGHT!In sum, I would highly recommend this as a very solid phone for a very competitive price -- perfect solution if you want near top-grade phone without the high price.Good luck shopping!",2016年4月15日 在美国审核

Excellent phone for the price.......,"After using this phone for a month, I think I can honestly say that for the price-it's an excellent phone. I've had much pricier phones that don't perform as well or feel as good in my hand as this one does. It has all the features I would ever want or need in a phone &amp; is pretty easy to use, despite not coming with any instructions (except what is on the sticker affixed to the back of the phone). I love the camera on this phone-it seems to take much clearer pictures without the annoying delay that is on my Samsung. The slightly bigger screen is a plus too, since I use my camera quite frequently. I have many apps on the phone &amp; have not had any issues with locking up or lagging, My only negative with this phone is the battery is not removable, so unlike other phones that can be 'rebooted' by removing the battery &amp; putting it back in if necessary-that is not possible with the Honor 5X. Other than that-I'm very happy with this phone &amp; would feel comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for a mid-priced phone with all the features &amp; performance of much higher priced phones.",2016年2月29日 在美国审核
One of the best smartphones at its price range,"BRIEF REVIEWI've been using the honor 5x for a month already, I wanted to use it and familiarize with its functions and characteristics in order to build a solid opinion before making this review. The honor 5x is one of the best if not the greatest budget Smartphone at its current price range. This is a great Smartphone for the price and it is even better since I got it for $120 during Amazon’s prime day. Realistically speaking, for $199 there are not many options on the market that can give you specs such as octa-core processor, aluminum construction, fingerprint sensor, 2gb Ram, and a 5.5-inch screen that the honor has to offer. It is more than evident that the honor 5x is not the best Smartphone on the market, I would recommend people to have realistic expectations, do not expect this device to be at the same level as a galaxy s7 when it is about $350 more expensive than the honor 5x. I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a cheap Smartphone with really nice specs, personally I really like this device it serves my need as a user, in fact I never though I could get this much Smartphone performance at such a low price.DETAILED REVIEWConstruction:The honor 5x body is made of aluminum, but for some reason it feels like plastic at times depending on the temperature, it might be because of its brushed surface. In low temperatures you can tell it is metal because it gets really cold (which plastics doesn’t). That being said I still like it's feeling I've always liked metal feeling over glass or plastic.Appearance:The physical appearance of the honor 5x does not disappoint, it really looks like a high-end Smartphone, it is well built with solid high quality materials, not mentioning the amazing little details that Huawei carved into the honors metallic back. The metal is easy to scratch but it is not an exclusive con for this device since most metals devices tend to get Scratch easily. The design on this phone is very attractive and comparable to that of the HTC one series which I believe is an assertive decision, in conclusion the honor 5x looks and feels really premium and well made on the hand.Camera:Personally I don't care that much about the camera since I don't take a lot of pictures. It fulfills my needs in terms of video and photo quality but I can see why some people didn't like it. The camera is not the best on the market, for some reason the colors on some pictures doesn't look vivid enough, at low luminosity the camera simply falls behind compared to other smartphones such as the moto g. One thing that I liked is the software they implemented for the camera, honor added helpful features and filters that can make the camera experience a little more peasant or endurable. When it comes to the video aspect the recording seems a little shaky, but that is because this device doesn't have an optical image stabilizer, one positive aspect is that it is possible to record in slow motion.Speed:As the specifications state this device is an octa-core, which allows you to run almost every app, game or video without any kind of lag. When I received the honor 5x it came with EMUI 3.1 and Android lollipop, and at that moment the device had some lags at the interface mostly when trying to open one app when running many apps simultaneously even when I had. Fortunately that doesn't happen as much as before, after the last update the honor 5x was optimized. Now it runs EMUI 4.0 and Android marshmallow but I would advise people to install Google launcher since it kind of optimizes speed compared to the EMUI launcher.Display:The honor 5x has a 5.5 inch display which makes it a phablet, personally I really like the screen size on this device its, large size isn't an inconvenient for me but it comes with a preinstalled one-hand software in case the user can't reach the corners. The screen is full HD, which makes watching movies, videos or playing games a pretty good experience. My only complain is that the screen is not bright enough compared to other devices and sometimes it a little hard to read or see when the sunlight hits the screen directly.Fingerprint sensor:The honor 5x fingerprint sensor as of today is simply one of the best ones on the market, it is one of the biggest pros on this device considering that this is a mid-range smartphone. One of the best features on this device is that it doesn't just unlocks the phone but it can also launch almost any app instantaneously after unlocking, not mentioning that it is possible to take the a picture by touching the finger print sensor. The sensor on this device is unarguably amazing and one of the best features that the honor 5x has to offer to the user.Gaming:Thus device is capable of running the latest games at high settings with little lags from time to time, but nothing considerable or noticeable enough to affect the gaming experience. The only downside of this device is the that It doesn't have a gyroscope which means that all those Pokémon go players will be able to catch Pokémon’s but they won't be able to use the camera for catching them, the AR mode will simply be disable. A little disappointing aspect for Pokémon go players like myself but on the bright side it saves battery life on my honor 5x.Battery life:The honor 5x comes with a generous 3000 mAh battery but with such a large screen it simply doesn’t last the whole day during heavy use. I has some power saving modes that I never use because they take away some speed from the device, I simply prefer an optimized Smartphone over a power saving one.StorageUnfortunately when it comes to the storage the honor 5x is not the best, 16gb may seem little storage capacity for some users like myself but luckily it has an SD slot that allows the user to improve the storage capacity.",2016年8月19日 在美国审核

Very nice. I snagged it on Amazon Prime day for ...,"Very nice. I snagged it on Amazon Prime day for $120 so, yeah, very happy with the price (was thinking of buying even at the going price of about $185-$195). I needed a dual SIM, and I also very much prefer the freedom of additional storage which microSD card provides (when I say prefer it's more like non-negotiable). Love the fingerprint scanner and that I can use different finger to wake open the phone into different apps. My slight beef is with the card bays - not easy to remove them, requires the included SIM card removal tool or a paperclip or some such. The top slot was especially tough to remove, but that's the one with only a SIM card, so hopefully I won't need to open it too often. Another slight beef is non-removable battery but I knew it and accepted it going in. The battery actually is pretty good, compared to my previous phone (Sammy Galaxy S3), which has to be charged every day even with very light use.Everybody curses the EMUI overlay, and I am not enamoured with it either, especially coming from Samsung (maybe I just got used to Samsung, but - as an example - when setting an alarm clock or time, on the Sammy you can use an entire numeric pad to set hours/ minutes, while on the Honor 5x you have to scroll through the numbers, one by one, WTF?) Anyway, will wait for the Marshmallow update, reportedly the overlay is better under Marshmallow, worst case will try CGM. For the money ($120), much better value than Samsung.",2016年7月30日 在美国审核

This phone is just bad. Stock OS on it is EXTREMELY slow,"This phone is just bad. Stock OS on it is EXTREMELY slow, clunky and tries to be iOS (no app drawer).

A good flagship killer phone,"As someone who has only used entry-level smartphones before this one, I am very pleased. The display is vibrant and crisp, the larger screen size is great, and overall it has a stylish flagship feel and functionality at a reasonable price.One thing to be aware of is the phone's custom UI. It's different from other Android phone UIs that I've used--specifically, its lack of the usual Android app drawer. It was strange at first, but I like grouping things into folders so I had no issue getting used to it (you can always download an alternate launcher like Nova if you prefer a drawer.) I also noticed a lot of people complaining about the UI being ugly, but honestly I like it. I prefer more ""minimalist"" UIs that don't have that beveled look.It doesn't have a great processor, but it's not a bad one. This probably wouldn't be a phone for smooth upper level mobile gaming, namely games with 3D graphics in real time (ex. shooters.) However, it runs other games just fine. I play ""mobage"" games, which don't have too many 3D assets, and unlike my old phone, it runs them perfectly.The fingerprint scanner is also a great plus. I didn't buy this phone for it and I didn't have much intention to use it, but I've grown attached to how convenient it is for unlocking my phone. I also have small hands, so touching the finger pad to take a photo is so much easier than trying to reach the on screen shutter button.Anyway these are just my experiences with the phone thus far. If you're looking for a phone with a flagship feel without having to shell out big bucks, this one is definitely worth looking into.",2016年5月14日 在美国审核
Excellent $200 phone.,"For $199 unlocked phone, you can't really beat this.Many people don't like the stock UI, but I like it so far. Still preferred Windows Phone but I need an Android for development purposes and this fit the bill perfectly.Frankly, mobile phone is so fast now that the speed is hardly matter. Since this is an Android phone, it really came down to stability and battery life.This phone has very decent battery life. I used it all day today and still get 70% left when I plugged it in tonight. This is probably the best so far. The first few days, I would say 50% left at the end of the day. Not bad.Stability wise, no crash thus far. Mostly very smooth. However, there are times when the phone is not very sensitive to touch. Not all the time, but sometime. I'm not sure what happened. It got annoying sometime, but that doesn't last long enough to really make me mad :-). The photo quality is not as good as iPhone or my old Lumia but good enough for casual picture taking. If I am serious about taking good picture, I would use my DSLR.In general, I am very pleased with this phone. I'm making the phone's CPU for a living, so I am very familiar with phones. There are phones out there that may be 30% faster than this, but do you really need that? If you do, then you would need to shell out $500 more. Just not worth it for me.Even at $200, I would consider this a high-end phone quality (vs. premium like iPhone, Samsung etc.) due to its solid build and good software.

This may be a game changer,"First off, I'm not a tech reviewer--just a consumer who has little previous experience as a smartphone user. My review will concentrate on my personal experience with this phone.There is a lot of technical info on the Honor site as well as good information in the Q &amp; A under other reviewers' comments. So please refer to those sections to get technical aspects on this device.This phone came unlocked, so I ordered an H20 sim card from Amazon (only $.01!), installed it, ported my number, and activated my new service. I had to configure with the help of customer service, but that went fairly smoothly.Please note: The battery is permanent, and the phone does not open up. The sim and micro SD slots are accessible from the side, using the pin tool provided--Do not lose it!I YouTubed a video to install my cards properly. It was easy to do.Let me start off by saying this is a beautiful phone!! The aluminum case gives the phone a high-end feel and a look of quality construction. It is thin, sleek, but substantial in your hand. It's kind of large, but that makes it better for viewing, especially if your eyesight is not perfect. We also have a Samsung S5 in the house, and this one compares well to it, especially in terms of its construction.The large screen is beautiful to look at. Netflix looks amazing on this phone. This phone is marketed to people born in the computer age. No manual needed--just intuitive exploration. Even though I haven't had a smart phone before, most everything I want to do is apparent. Apps load quickly, and the touch screen is responsive.The fingerprint ID function on this phone is a great feature. It quickly unlocks the phone, answers a call, or can take a photo. It was easy for me to set up and feels futuristic.The camera is 13 megapixels and takes a gorgeous shot. (Please refer to photo.) You can adjust a few things, but not so many that it's intimidating to use.I've loaded Amazon Prime Music on here (easily and quickly) and have had no problems. I Bluetoothed it to my headphones, and it sounds great.I'm paranoid, so I did put a screen protector on it, but this may be overkill on a screen that already has a special coating on it. I've also ordered a protective case (sad that it will cover the beautiful aluminum, but I want to protect it from drops). There are not many styles available yet because this phone is so new. A clear case would be much prettier.All in all, can't see why you'd spend $500+ when you can get this really beautiful and nicely made phone with all the functions for less than half that price.I really believe this is a nice mid-priced smartphone.

Nice to look at...terrible to use.,"A great looking mobile device that feels sturdy and well-made...but don't judge this book by its sleek cover. Under the hood is a laggy processor, infuriatingly slow wifi and a touch screen with multiple performance issues. To preserve the considerable cosmetic appeal of the Honor 5x, you'll definitely want to get a protective cover, especially for the fully exposed aluminum back which does not hide scratches well. I found the proprietary UI overlay to be an annoying oddity. I'm not an Android groupie, but I have no idea what Huawei was trying to achieve here. Even with a switch to a third-party launcher, the manufacturer has tossed out many of stock Android's more useful features in favor of their own crazy quilt approach to the user experience. Now that I've switched to the vastly superior BLU Life One X, I can see what all of the complaining was about re: the Huawei UI. I have no idea how much this additional layer of bloat contributes to the Honor's clunky performance, but it in short order the phone began to show the surprisingly restrictive limits of its internal processing prowess. I do not use my mobile device for gaming or watching streaming media nor do I overload it with dozens of memory hogging apps. Even under the most basic day-to-day operations, the Honor 5x was slow to respond. Apps stutter and fail frequently, SMS messages randomly refuse to send and even transitions from screen to screen (or opening the app drawer) come with frequent freezes and delays. The device always felt like it was struggling to keep up. The wifi experience is equally frustrating, with ridiculous lags and freezes across multiple high speed internet connections. It was often faster to turn off the wifi toggle and use the 4G connection, especially when reading news or using Chrome. There is a finger print reader on the back of the phone that is pretty much useless. At least half the time it would fail to recognize any of the prints I had recorded and registered. Even more problematic, after less than three months the touch screen began to fail. Anytime the phone was in my pocket, the screen would turn on and start registering imputs. Several times a week, the phone would completely freak out and act as though an invisible hand was actively using the touch screen and doing so with crazy speed. Sending text messages became and exercise in frustration because the on screen keyboard would not properly register the letter my finger was choosing. This was the deal breaker than finally convinced me to dump the device and get a different phone. If I'm tossing aside a $200 purchase after only a few months, you know things are pretty bleak. This was my first experience with a Huawei mobile device and it will also be my last.",2016年8月25日 在美国审核

The EMUI skin takes some time getting used to (maybe less if you're coming from an iPhone, as EMUI is heavily inspired by iOS), but the phone offers great battery life, an impressive fingerprint scanner, an above average camera for the price, and mid-range specs.

Finally a Chinese phone that works well !,"First, let me say that this is a COMPARATIVE review. Comparative with respect to the phones I previously had, a Huawei Ascend mate (stoled) and a Ulefone Be Touch, a Chinese low-cost (but powerful on the paper) that I bought when my Huawei got stolen and didn't want to spend too much.I think that it is important to introduce it, as in reality each review is based on the reviewer previous experience.Now, let me just anticipate the conclusions: this is a great phone, which only downside are minor delays in opening apps or running heavy apps.I have read almost all the reviews available online before buying the phone, so here some info you'll not find on them:- the FINGERPRINT really works. This is not always the true for all the phones. The Ulefone Be Touch one was crap, although it may had to do with the position: while less practical, being the scanner on the back you always touch it with the finger on the same angle. Conversely, on the Be Touch the fingerprint is on the top, and you may touch it with your finger using a wider case of angles. And trust me, you'll need a fingerprint scanner if your phone is stolen and you don't want to give people free access to all your digital world (and no.. password or pattern are so slow that you'll end up disabling them)- the 5.5 inches SCREEN includes the buttons sidebar on the bottom, so it's not so big really. In other phones you have a true 5.5 inches display PLUS the capacitive buttons on the bottom. The screen looks nice - clear and bright-, but almost all screens nowadays are nice to me (with the exception of 800x640 pixels screen in the cheapest 10 inches tablets), so no real point here.-while there is a very heterogeneous opinions on the quality of the CAMERA, I found it to make somehow less nice photos than the Ulefone ones, of course in low-light conditions (I am not a photographer, and to me all outdoor photos seems the same). You can get a bit of funny in discovering the meaning of ""beauty"" for asians using the ""beauty mode""- the PROCESSOR unfortunately is a bit crap. Yes, all works.. but it takes a few seconds for apps to open, and for heavy apps like OsmAnd (an open source GPS navigator that draws on the map ton of polygons by default) you can really see the difference, even with the cheap Ulefone that here ""wins"". It also warms a bit.. not really ""hot"" and pretty comfortable in February to warm your hands in the pocket, but maybe in the summer I'm going to hate it!- the SOFTWARE layer that Huawei adds on top of Android.. maybe I am the only one but I like it. I mean, I like playing with something a little bit different. I found it nice and polish, and you have hundreds of themes to suit your taste (I recall a review that was complaining the icons have too large rounded corners.. it really depends from the theme, just select an other theme to have square/circle/whatever shape icons you want!) . Also an other complain is the missing of the app drawer selector.. but even for that, if you miss it, just download one from the Google Play Store (same for the home launcher).- the BATTERY seems to work well, but it's only a few days I have the phone, and it's too early to express an opinion for it;- the RADIO signal /call quality and stability is great. Really, that's the reason I bought this phone after the experience with the Ascend Mate (+) and the Ulephone Be Touch (-----), and not e.g. the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 that on the paper seems more powerful. After all, this is a **mobile** so if the radio compartment is s., it makes the whole phone useless.- the DESIGN is really really beautiful, but this is really subjective, so I left this as the last point.Enjoy!",2016年2月9日 在美国审核

Beautiful display and good processing speed,"Unboxing this, it's gorgeous. Lightweight, sturdy feeling build, nice big screen. Sleek, really, really sleek. It takes about 1.5-2 hours to charge fully. The battery will last all day with normal use.My network is a local company and I checked to make sure it was GSM. I put the sim card in the phone and it worked perfectly.The cameras are 13mp for the rear camera and 5 mp for the front camera, so you can get decent photos with it. It's not as good as a dedicated camera of course, but more than sufficient for daily photos and videos. It snaps pictures quickly in most lighting, and has different modes that are easy to access. I like how it does with close up photos of things like food and crafts, but it also does well with the bigger photos that I need to take at work.Fast load, and it works with a few apps open at a time. It's the first phone I've had that really does work as a full time substitute for my tablet for working because it has a good enough screen and it's large enough to run the apps I need for my job. I wouldn't want to read a book on it, or watch a full length movie, but for day to day needs it works great.Expandable memory can go up to 128 gbs. I have a 64 gb micro-sd in it now. Saving and loading data to/from the card is fast and easy.Because the battery case can't be opened, and it needs to be serviced professionally, the sim cards and sd cards have their own slots. The phone comes with a small needle pointed tool to open the slots and they are secure once they are in there. Keep the tool someplace it won't get lost so you can get back to your cards if necessary.I've been using it for about a week now, and it's been a joy. A solid performer with the higher end features like a fantastic display and good processing speed that I need.One thing- this doesn't come with a manual. It's pretty intuitive because Android is very easy to use.",2016年1月29日 在美国审核

Two Stars,"Buying this phone helped me to realize that it's worth the extra money to just buy a flagship phone, especially an iPhone. I didn't like how the body of the honor 5x felt like I could twist it or bend it and break the thing, or how slow and glitchy the software felt right out of the box. There are definitely great things about it for the price, but a flagship it is not. After I returned it I bought a Samsung galaxy s7. Much more solid build, really solid, software still sucked, but faster. But my battery would be at 20% at the end of the work day. I checked battery stats and found dozens of system apps using most of the battery and they couldn't be disabled.I returned the s7 and bought an iPhone 7. This is the only one of the three that feels really premium in every way. My battery is at 70% end of day, I have more control over apps running in the background, and it's more secure. So much more refined and a pleasure to use.",2017年2月16日 在美国审核
Improves on my Samsung Galaxy S5,"NOTE: Please check out the comments. Some good questions and discussion going on there!================Interestingly, I recently read an article where Huawei was partnering with Google to make the next version of the Nexus 7 tablet for this April/May 2016. And when I saw that Huawei had their own line of phones, this made me very interested as I 'assume' Google wouldn't partner with them if the quality was poor. Thus I had high expectations for this phone and so far I'm not disappointed.================I currently have the Galaxy S5 (2014), which has been a great phone.I searched Google and found several web sites with the technical specs for this phone versus the Galaxy S5. See if you can find a side-by-side comparison site and it will help put things into perspective.================PROCESSOR:Honor has 1.5Ghz processor with 8 cores = should make for good multitasking and it seems to.I've ran 3 games at once -- all updating on Internet simultaneously -- and I didn't loose progress or have lag.MEMORY:The 2Gb RAM of memory is a very welcome addition (same as Samsung) as videos stream or play locally very well. Playing a driving game I had no lag. Web pages load pretty fast via Chrome browser.DISPLAY:Display Resolution: 1080 x 1920, same as Samsung. This offers a great viewing screen with clarity and good brightness.The screen is 5.5 inches versus the Samsung is 5.10. That half inch difference is very noticeable next to each other. . .I definitely like the larger screen! Since I take all my pictures with my phone, I'll try and find another camera and show the phones side-by-side so you can see too.SPACE:The 16Gb 'hard drive'/SSD space (actual is 14.9Gb) left me with 10.51Gb free (9.84Gb actual). Thus still a good amount of room to install a bunch of apps. No way will my music fit on this or pictures, but that is what the MicroSD/TFT is for. After installing 20+ apps I'm down to 7.5Gb with my dropbox files storing to the MicroSD card instead of the device memory. There are some games that are 1Gb or larger (a few at least), so I still have room for more stuff.MICRO SD:Supports up to a 128Gb MicroSD card. I currently have a 32Gb installed. MicroSD was recognized without any issue and is able to save/write files and read files pretty fast. No issues playing a movie file. . .once I downloaded a good video app like MX Player. I didn't like the default video player it came with as it didn't have the codec needed to play my video file.BATTERY:Battery on the samsung is 2800 mAh and is replaceable. The Honor has a 3000 mAh, but is NOT replaceable. The Honor battery does seems to last longer, but no ejecting the battery if the system gets stuck. They removable sticker on the back (see image) says to hold the Power Button down for 10seconds to do a hard reset.I do not have a rapid charger, but I'm getting between 43% to 50% charge per hour of charging. Hopefully that gives you an idea how fast this battery charges.DUAL SIM:Why Do You Want a Dual-SIM phone?A phone with two SIM cards can hold two numbers and two identities at once. You can make or receive calls and send or receive texts on either number and give each number only to the people that you chose.EXAMPLE: When traveling to Greece, you can keep your local US number and then add in a temporary Greece number as you cruise around the Mediterranean.You could have your 'personal' phone number plus a separate work number running at the same time and keep the calls separate. You could also use one SIM for calls and if you have a better plan with another carrier for data, you could choose to use the 2nd SIM for data. Great feature!NOTE: I put my AT&amp;T SIM into this device and rebooted. Connected immediately to 4G LTE and received calls. No issues!!According to the manufacturer specs, you can get 4G with either of the two SIM slots.CONNECTIONS:Phone has Bluetooth 4.1 and Wi-Fi b/g/n. Thus connecting to networks and devices is a snap.The specs say this has a USB connection through the MicroUSB (charging) port. See photo of an app that says the phone is USB ready. I have an on-the-go (OTG) cable show up on Sunday 1/24 but I couldn't get it to work. I have an email into customer service asking for assistance.TETHERING:USB tethering worked immediately upon plugging the phone into the laptop. I was browsing the Internet pretty fast on my laptop through the phone's connection.Bluetooth tethering, I had to make my laptop 'discoverable' before the unit would show up properly and I could bluetooth the phone with the laptop. Once it did, it worked well, but was a bit more of a process with the old bluetooth tech on my laptop. Other two options were much easier.WiFi hotspot worked easily. I was connected and browsing Internet without trouble. What helped was putting in my own custom password into the settings. Must be at least 8-characters long.OTHER FEATURES:Yes, it has GPS.Yes, it has an accelerometer.Yes, it has fingerprint feature for identification / taking photos / launching apps / lock or unlock mode / answering calls / canceling an alarmCAMERA:13MP camera and a 5MP selfie camera. Thus when Skyping you'll come through very clear! True the Samsung has a 16MP camera. . .a bit better but not a huge difference. But it also has a poor 1 or 2MP selifie camera, which is often unclear I find. The upgraded Honor front camera is another great addition.Added outdoor and indoor pictures taken with Honor 5x and Galaxy s5, using default settings. The Galaxy seems brighter is the only real difference I can tell.HOW-TO:My box did NOT come with a user manual and I could not find a 'support' link clearly marked on Huawei's site. Thus good luck with figuring some things out. . .though Android operating system is fairly intuitive.OVERALL:This is very comparable in many ways to my older phone, but they have just the right amount of upgrades that make this phone stand out. It is working great for me and even shipped with a screen protector.Now to find a case that won't take 6-8 weeks to ship from China and doesn't have only little girl colors. So far that is proving more difficult than you'd think.",2016年1月21日 在美国审核

good phone,"I got this phone on Amazon Prime day and the price was a good deal.The operation of the phone is fine - snappy enough for what I used it for. My major disappointment was how easily the screen scratched.I have had a lot of phones and tablets over the years.I rarely buy screen protectors for them.Usually I drop them and ding up the edges more than the screen.I have been careful to keep this one in my pocket with no keys or anything else hard (just my other phone which does have a case and screen protector).The screen on this is filled with razor thin scratched and etchings already and it is only a few weeks old.I suspect it will be too badly marked before long to see it well enough and will have to get rid of it.I took a chance on a Huawei and regret it.I guess I'm back to the more reliable phones that the carriers stock (and presumably use Gorilla glass so they are tough to scratch).UPDATE - I didn't realize this had a screen protector that came with it, so that was probably my mistake.I am updating my rating from two to four stars and appreciate the clarification by the manufacturer.The installed screen protector was not good and scratched too easily (I have had others as I said) so I will knock them one star for that but otherwise it is a good phone.",2016年8月1日 在美国审核

ZTE Zmax 2 Much Better Value @ $60,"Everyone seems to rave about this phone and I am not sure why. Phone does have a partial metal body, fingerprint sensor (a pretty fast one at that), decent 1080p screen (albeit with black bars around it to make the bezel seem smaller than it really is), 5.5-inch body, comes with a pre-installed screen protector (only because it does not have a gorilla glass for the screen) and all that sounds good right? BUT all that is useless because of the speed of the phone. Phone is very slow because of the heavy EMUI skin on top of Android. Huawei's software simply kills the phone. This is still true even after Marshmallow upgrade. If you bought it on prime day for $120, I guess it's an OK value. Otherwise, if you don't need a dual SIM and can live without a fingerprint sensor, you will get the same or better performance from a $60 ZTE Zmax 2 which has the same 5.5-inch size, lower resolution 720p screen, Snapdragon 410 and same 2GB of RAM but for only $60 (easily unlockable for free). I have both phones and Zmax 2 still feels faster in everyday use.Guys at the XDA are working on a Cyanogen ROM ([...])that is supposed to make the phone much faster and truly show what Snapdragon 615 can do when it is not overloaded by bloated software.",2016年7月24日 在美国审核

A great modern state-of-the-art smartphone!,"This is an excellent new smartphone. It is an android phone so if you are familiar with the android system this should be familiar in most regards. Let me go over some of the less typical features: first, the back does not come off of this and the battery is not accessible to the user. If you have a problem with the battery, you are required to get it serviced. As a result, to insert the sim cards and micro sd card, there are two little drawers that open up on the side. To open them, you need to insert a pin tool which is provided(don't lose it!). As I am sure you noticed, it has a fingerprint recognition system. You do not have to implement it unless you wish. Keep in mind that some people(like myself!) do not have viable fingerprints. Also, fingerprint quality can change(such as dried cracked skin from winter dryness and injury to the finger). I do not recommend relying on fingerprint systems. If you use fingerprint recognition as your only phone lock and one day your phone no longer recognizes your fingerprint(perhaps because you got a cut on your finger), then what will you do? I don't know if you can set it up so that you can override the fingerprint recognition with a pin number; that would be nice, but I don't want to experiment with that. But the fingerprint button can also be used to trigger the camera(it can also be set up to trigger other functions, such as answering a call and you don't need to set up fingerprint recognition to do that) and you don't need to set that up; it is the default; of course, you can also trigger the camera with the on-screen button. I liked the file navigation on this phone. I had no problem navigating to the micro sd(I loaded it with the files I needed before inserting it into the phone) as I have had with other android phones. One problem with this phone is that there is no documentation at all and I do mean none. Even on the website there is no documentation and nothing to download. The only way to learn about this phone is to explore the phone. Since most of you are already familiar with android phones, this is not a big problem. It is just strange. If you are not familiar with the android system, you should be able to apply information from other android phones to this, more or less. Documentation may become available when this phone hits the market since the phone I have was given to me as an advanced distribution for evaluation. The quality of sound and image are as good as it gets, just as you would expect from a phone like this. The octo-core processor is also state-of-the-art. The feel of the phone in your hand is great, being very slim and lightweight. It comes with a screen protector already installed. As far as phones go in this price range, this is great!Here are the network specs(from their website):Network RateLTE FDD:B2/B4/B5/B12/B17 WCDMA:B1/B2/B4/B5 GSM:850/900/1800/1900MHzIt also has excellent WI-FI reception.

Good device / HORRIFIC COSTUMER SERVICE!!!,"Straight to the point.PROS : Awesome phone, sturdy and very nicely built, very nice materials, battery is decent and the UI is flawless with the 2Gigs of RAM , sent two of them overseas as birthday gifts for my parents.Cons : And I will be perfectly honest. If you are planning on buying this phone or any other phone from Huwai expecting some form of costumer support, then you are out of luck. Matter of fact I didn't even need help with the device ""I am an IT professional this is what I do for a living"" all I wanted is a piece of information from the manufacturer, required by customs to verify that device is CE compliant ""same as FCC compliance but for Europe , Huwai devices are being sold in at least two HUWAI retail centers in the heart of PARIS / FRANCE. With that being said, certificate of conformity is public record and should be provided when requested. Just to prove a point, got the same certificate for three other devices, two Motorola 360 smart watches ""found certificates on their website, perfect!!!"" and a BLU phone Energy X2, contacted headquarters in Florida and within half an hour of talking with a manager, got the certification via email, perfect!!! Now remind you this whole nightmare is very time sensitive, I had only one week to provide this information for all 4 gifts or they are all gone and I am 500$ out of luck. I called Huwai so many times that i can even recall, called Honor X5 support hotline, every number I could find, it gotten to the point where I talked to the same person twice in a week, I remembered his voice and after confronting him about it, he admitted that he talked to me and never went through with his promise to have someone humour me and call me back. By the way HUWAI if you see this, attached is the two case numbers , one of them isn't even mine but my name was on it go figure !!!! Ticket number T368995 and ticket T334109-060116. None of them was resolved by the way !!! My only saving grace was that the costums officer / gentleman my parents dealt with half way around the world cut them some slack since they had the documents of conformity for 3 out of the 4 devices and let them have the box.See, this review is fair, good device and HORRIFIC COSTUMER SERVICE. I will insist on an official apology from Huwai, worked in COSTUMER SERVICE for years and still do, this was absolutely disrespectful at the least. I can buy a device and ditch few minutes later without blinking if only I had some human beings that show some interest on the other side of the line, people that care about their product but overall the satisfaction of their costumers because that's what will ensure their strength or weakness in a competitive market like ours.Cudos to BLU and Motorola.Huwai, let me know when you resolve those two ticket numbers...",2016年6月15日 在美国审核

High-end features at mid-range prices,"So, a little about my phone history. I currently use a Nokia Lumia 1020, which runs Windows Phone 8.1. It has a 41 megapixel camera and a 4.7"" 720p OLED display. My wife currently uses an iPhone 6 and likes it quite a bit. She previously used a Samsung Galaxy S4 and was not a big fan, primarily due to bloatware and unreliable camera performance. I use a Sony Xperia Z android tablet with some regularity, while my wife has a Amazon Kindle Fire tablet for reading and browsing. All of this should suffice to say I've been around the block with respect to phones and operating systems.So, the Huawei Honor 5X. This phone's internals include 2gb of RAM, 16gb of internal storage (expandable with 128gb SD card), a 4-core Snapdragon 615 CPU, a 5.5"" 1080p IPS LCD screen, a 13 megapixel camera with a dual-LED flash, a rear fingerprint sensor, and runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box.Overall, I was quite impressed with this phone for the price. Here is my breakdown.DISPLAYThe 5.5"" IPS LCD display is every bit the equal of the iPhone. It is quite sharp and seemed to give every bit of the detail of 1080p, with good solid black levels (not quite to the depth of OLED) and good daylight visibility. I was especially pleased with the oleophobic coating that seems to have been applied at the factory (as a sticker). This made the touchscreen a joy to use and I almost never had to wipe it off. Bringing the phone to the ear did leave some smudges, but not as bad as some phones. The display is set by default to auto-dim in response to the environment, and I found this performance to be mostly good, perhaps just a bit slow on the uptake for brightening back up. My only real complaint is that, perhaps due to the combination of screen size (rather large) and thin side bezels, I had unwanted touch inputs from the side of my palm more than I would have liked. It only happened a few times, but it took me out of what I was doing once or twice.AUDIOThe main speaker is on the bottom end of the phone. It did get appreciably loud, but became distorted above about 80% of max volume. Perfectly sufficient for some casual Netflix watching, but if you listen to music you will want to use a nice set of earbuds or headphones (not included).PERFORMANCEI was really pleased by the performance of Android Lollipop on this phone, which has ""mid-range"" internals. I never felt any lags or stutters, except perhaps when receiving a notification. The main apps I tested were Netflix, Threes, Dots, Facebook, MSN News, Wikipedia, the Google Play Store, and Amazon's ""Underground"" (?) store. Now, these are not incredibly demanding apps to be sure, but each was buttery smooth. They all loaded very snappily (the slowest being Threes), scrolling was completely smooth, and switching between apps was instantaneous. There was no problem with memory management - there always seemed to be about 1gb of RAM free at any given time. The chassis did get rather warm while playing Threes, but not really anything above ""slight"" for all the other apps tested.CAMERAThe Honor 5X possesses what I would term an average smartphone camera for 2016. Yes, I am spoiled by the Lumia 1020, which still wins most internet shootouts despite being a 2013 phone. The Honor 5X runs Android's stock camera interface and has no dedicated shutter button (something I miss coming from a Lumia). Detail is good but not great, and zooming is hard-limited to about 2X. The flash performance is typical for an LED - a bit too bright close-up, not sufficient for far shots. It should only be used in a pinch. In daylight shots, the Honor 5X turns in a performance that is about the equal of the iPhone, to my eyes. It's not going to fool anyone into thinking it was taken with a DSLR (like the Lumia 1020 sometimes can), but you won't embarrass yourself on social media, either.I have included two snaps - the first is the Honor 5X, indoors, with flash. Notice how blown out the LED flash makes the clock's glass, the contrast on the speaker grille, and the wood grain. The second pic is from my Lumia 1020 with Xenon flash. Detail, contrast, and color are all superior to my eye, especially in the above-mentioned areas. But with this said, I think this is a pretty average performance in today's market, and it's certainly competent for sharing.BUILD QUALITYYou will be forgiven for thinking this phone is a clone of the HTC One line of phones from the rear. It is virtually identical. The aluminum chassis is pleasant to the touch and has all the requisite openings for antenna pass-through. The speaker holes on the bottom are symmetrical a la the iPhone 6. I did find the use of a serial number sticker on the back in between the camera and the fingerprint sensor to be a bit ugly. The body does not creak or bend with normal use or pressure. There are two SIM slots on the side that open with your typical SIM key.Speaking of the fingerprint sensor, it does the job, and will turn the phone on within about half a second. I will say though that it failed to read on the first try about 10-20% of the time. This is not as good as the iPhone's iteration of the fingerprint sensor. Battery life seems quite good. The 3000 mAh battery is more than enough to power the mid-range internals for an entire day, probably a day and a half of moderate use. The Micro-USB port at the bottom (sorry, no USB-C) is quite clicky and firm. Speaking of clicky and firm, the volume rocker and power button are definitely these.CONCLUSIONAll in all, this is a pretty solid Android phone for 2016, that ticks a lot of boxes and does them all pretty well. Every feature of this phone is at or above the mean for today's market. I would have given it 4 stars, except for one huge factor - the price. At under 200 smackers, this is a whale of a deal. You're getting almost all of the performance of one of Samsung's higher end wallet-busters, but without the bloatware or the red-hot Snapdragon 810 internals, that eat battery like nobody's business. This phone competes very favorably with Motorola's popular Moto G line, which really sort of created this price segment. Huawei is making an aggressive play for the mid-range by including a few standout features like 1080p and fingerprint sensing.I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to anyone shopping in this price range for an android phone, and I would even suggest a good long look at it for people who usually aim for the higher-end. If and when my Lumia 1020 goes the way of the dodo, I would not have any problem switching up, though I would miss a higher-end camera.",2016年1月22日 在美国审核

Android Telephone not for me.,"I have been an Apple iPhone user for years, this is my first experience with an Android telephone. The telephone arrived on time. I do like the minimal glitz box. A simple box to contain the telephone. I have spent the best part of today trying to use the telephone just to play music. This is definitely not iTunes &amp; iPhone. Getting music to the telephone is labor intensive and time consuming. I never did figure out how to transfer my playlists to the telephone. I have them exported from iTunes and loaded them on to a 16GB MicroSDcard. Android does not find the playlists. I used the m3u format. I do find it annoying that the telephone lists all the songs in alphabetical order and not the original play order. Setting up openvpn is far more complicated than with the iPhone. Given my experience with the Android telephone so far i would purchase an Apple IPhone 6 before purchasing a sim card for this Android telephone. I feel like i am having to fight with the operating system to accomplish what i want. Given the maturity of Android the complete lack of seamless interfacing with iTunes is a major negative against the telephone. I have learned what i was hoping to learn when i purchased this android telephone. Android telephones are not my cup of tea. I will gladly pay much more for an unlocked iPhone 6 for the smooth interaction with iOS and iTunes. Having the ""home"" button on the back of the telephone is a negative.I keep looking for it on the front.The screen size is a good size. The music i was able to play did not sound as good as when played on an iPhone. That is no surprise given that iTunes and iPhone are seamless in operation. I cannot speak about telephone service at all. I will not be activating this telephone for cellular use. I am not sure what i shall do with it. I can use it for a camera, e-mail &amp; the web. I will wait and purchase a refurbished apple iphone to replace my aging iPhone 4.",2016年3月8日 在美国审核

"Phone stuck on 0% install, and Review is okay","**Phone has been seemingly stuck on 0% of initial software installation for several, several hours. Plugged in the power cable, insert the sim (ATT), and then turned on the power. Will raise the rating once it does something.This issue was solved eventually. I've had the phone for some time now, and here are my thoughts:The phone itself is very nice, and has a lot of good features. Once you tweak the settings away from their crazy setup, it works very nicely.The very very very BAD part of this phone is that, after a while you really notice how dirt slow this thing is (even tweaked). Everything you do has a lag. EVERYTHING! Sometimes it just does nothing till the slow processor can catch up.If I knew it was going to be like this, I would have never had bought this phone. I don't use it for anything but email, browse the web, and to maybe take a picture. SLOW! If I could re-do this purchase I would have spent a bit more on a phone that can handle what it's equipment. So the slow lagging speed (although good price) is still a negative, because although cheaper, they should ensure it runs smoothly without tons of never-ending lag.",2016年2月12日 在美国审核

Good starter or replacement phone.,"I remember as a kid there used to be a company called ""Sound Design.""They made radios and stereos that looked cool, had all the top features, and it was at a crazy low price.They looked really call.Once you bought a Sound Design Stereo you realized yes you got a lot of good looking features but once you put the stereo on you realized they were not great features.That is how I feel about the Honor 5x Unlocked phone.I really want to thank Huawei for letting me preview this phone.First and foremost for 200$ and unblocked its not a bad phone if you look at it that way.If my phone broke or I needed a phone that was not 600$ it is actually a decent option, but given the choice I don't think I will use it as my everyday phone.Some good features to point out are the construction. It feels like a great phone, the metal construction is solid.I like the big screen and the display also, the display is pretty sharp.I also like the fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone.It works well and is easy to use.But again, a lot of this is cosmetic.The phone looks and feels great on the outside.My issues seem to be with the operating system and the processor.My problem with the phone is that it just seems very slow and lagging and it does not help that it is still running snapdragon and lollipop.Some the apps I use, for example my fitness tracker seem to take forever to sync.The phone and its operating system just seem a bit slow and outdated for 2016.Also, I am not a big fan of the sound quality on actually making calls, it is decent but not great.I am not a phone expert, I am not technical.Bottom line for 200$ it might not be a bad starter phone or replacement phone.It has a lot of features just not a lot of up to date features in my opinion, and I am not ready to replace my Google Nexus with this phone.It is a great looking phone on the outside but the guts of the phone, maybe with an update should be better.Not a bad phone for 200$ bucks.As I learn more about this phone, I will continue to update this review.****just a quick update.I have continued to use the phone and I will stand by my 3 star review. I have added a memory SD card and made some settings changes recommended online.My basic premise has not changed.Great cosmetic features like display and screen.The battery is very strong and lasts a really long time.However, the phone is slow in my opinion.",2016年2月2日 在美国审核

It was certainly a well built phone all around. The Fingerprint sensor did not disappoint me at all. Screen, UI, and overall navigation was great in first few hours of use. Thought this is replacement I've been looking for. Spent almost all day downloading needed apps, arranged all the apps and screen based on my need, copied some music on the MicroSD card, setup all my email accounts, restored all my messages, calendar from a file and got the phone ready.After all of this, I turned the phone off to insert the microSD card and microSIM card into the phone, just when I turned the phone on, the whole thing just went down the drain. MY APPS ARRANGEMENT JUST WENT DEFAULT TO ALPHABETICAL. LOST ALL OF MY SETTINGS. Even restoring the phone from the backup did not return the phone to its original state when it was back up..

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND: I'm not savvy in phone lingo. This is a review from a casual blogger's point of view.,"It's been years since I've had anything other an iPhone and this reminded me why I switched.The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was that the processor was significantly slower than the iPhone. It took me a bit of getting use to, to find the app store and get a re-feel of how things worked. The App Store has added a bunch more apps since the last time I was there (like Instagram, yay) but it was also missing a few key apps I use on a daily basis as well. This isn't a huge deal breaker since my daily apps as a blogger are not the same as someone else's but in my experience, I was pretty bummed out about this. The camera in general is a little confusing to understand. But it's equipped with a 13MP camera which is pretty good. The camera also includes a number of interesting features to play around with.The phone is nicely weighted and it's pretty well made. I do like how you can easily upgrade the storage by using a micro SD card (iPhone get on it!), that makes the storage possibilities with this phone unlimited! The front screen is a really nice size as it takes up the majority of the face. The fingerprint feature on the back is also a nice touch and it's out of the way and doesn't take up space on the front face.Overall for the price you're getting a pretty legit phone. The price point isn't so bad either for a phone that runs like this.

"Free from clutter, but not free from flaws (list of preinstalled apps at end)","Update: On 1/27/17, Nextbit was acquired by Razer (the gaming hardware/software company). As of now, they are saying that the Robin will have one more year of software updates, and a 6-month hardware warranty. The Robin has been taken off sale in official channels (if you are buying this on Amazon, it’s likely through a seller that has some in stock still), and the manufacturing of new models has ceased. As of this update (02/02/17), I have yet to see what the official word is on Razer continuing the 100GB of cloud storage. Seems like an unusual acquisition, but hopefully Razer’s reputation will mean good things for the Nextbit line of phones (and won’t mean poor things for current owners of the Robin).-----------------------------Note, even though this phone is unlocked, it won’t work on Verizon Wireless or Sprint. There was a CDMA version in the works, but it was canceled before launch. It does, however, work for LTE and HSPA bands such as T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. Also, this uses the smaller Nano SIM like the iPhone rather than the slightly larger Micro SIM that is found in many android phones. For instance, I have both the Note 4 and LG G4, which use the micro SIM so I had to get a nano from my cellular provider. T-Mobile charges $20 for a new SIM, but they gave it to me free because I’ve been a customer for 9-years. Since there are times that I switch between phones, I also ordered a ",2016年9月1日 在美国审核
"Fantastic phone, but beware the nearly expired warranty (August 2017!)","First off, this is a great phone for the price point. Beautiful, sleek, and it runs perfectly for what I use it for (light to moderate use). The cloud storage of apps/photos seemed gimmicky to me and I don't use it (Photos automatically backs photos up in the background for me and I don't really need my apps backed up) but if that's a plus for you, by all means.Pros:-aesthetically very pleasing. I've had comments numerous times about how nice my phone looks and it does. It's a gorgeous phone, with sharp and sexy corners. The colors are bright and pop quite nicely-specs are great for the price point-camera is decent (compared to my Samsung S5, it's ""good enough"" and I actually prefer the nextbit camera)-nearly stock Android. If this is a plus for you, you will like this phone. No Samsung/LG/etc. bloatware.-Nextbit OS is pleasing to the eye and runs smoothly-update to Nougat fixed most of my battery issues, it runs pretty well (I get ~10 hours on one charge with moderate usage like internet browsing).-Nextbit founder is very active in the Nextbit community (answers questions, provides support, etc.) which is a nice change of paceCons:-buyout from Razer means the warranty was shortened to last up to August 2017. This is a pretty big deal for many people, and although it isn't a dealbreaker for me, it is something to be aware of.-buyout from Razer also means the future of Nextbit software updates is jeopardized (as far as I've read, it'll be supported up until next year. After that, it's unclear)-lack of ""official"" accessories. The official Nextbit store is completely sold out (as expected, it's a Kickstarter-backed product) and so the Amazon stock of Nextbit accessories similarly is quite limited. It took months for me to get a status update on the Nextbit wall charger I ordered, and that update was that it was cancelled. So just a heads up if that's something important to you.-phone sometimes heats up with extended usage. I'm not sure if this definitely will warp the phone or not, but so far I haven't seen any problems. Once summer rolls in, I guess I'll find out for sure.In short, this is a pretty pleasant, unique phone. That comes with its own set of problems, but if you can look past them, it's quite fantastic! I would really recommend it. I've been using it since late January and as of early May, I've had no issues.",2017年5月8日 在美国审核
Unbelievable value with some believable drawbacks.,"Unbelievable value with some believable drawbacks. For context sake, I upgraded from an LG G2, so take that in mind while I gush about things like the camera, which by today's standards may be average.The Good:- Performance. I've never owned an Android device that could blow through the Antutu Benchmark Garden scene quite like this one. Sure, there were occasional frame drops, but for the most part it was butter smooth. Overall it scored 74033 on my first try. Benchmark scores don't mean much for everyday use as perfectly functional devices can score as low as 20000.- Camera. I'm not much of a photographer but it takes good shots, and the front camera is sharp as a tack. Two-tone flash is also a nice perk for a phone so cheap.- NFC. Android pay is fast on this thing. If you're someone who's always on the go, you could appreciate that.- Display. Typical HD 1080 display, so if you're looking for 4K you won't find it here. Despite this, I think 4K on a 5.2 inch screen is overkill and unnecessary. The brightness of the screen is impressive as well.- Speakers. Stereo, front facing speakers. Why this isn't a standard on all phones is anyone's guess.- Fast charging. IF you have a capable brick (like my 2 Amp G2 charger), you'll find yourself surprised when you plug the phone in, come back in 30 minutes and see how much battery life you actually gained.The OK:- Charging cable. It's USB C, which is wonderfully forward thinking, but try finding one to charge your phone when you're out and about.- The physical shape. Rectangular phones are cool, but unwieldy. It's a pretty hard phone to hold, and the plastic doesn't make it any easier. Get a case.- I've heard good things about the cloud storage but haven't tried it. I put this in the OK column because you can turn it off, which you'll need to once Nextbit shuts their servers down (if they haven't already).- Fingerprint sensor. It works well enough, but I had to register the same fingerprint as 2-3 different fingers to get it working flawlessly.The Bad:- Battery life. This sub-2700mAH battery shouldn't really be all that much smaller than my G2's 3000, but it lasts half as long. Despite all the energy optimizations made in Android, none of them seem to help as I notice myself plugging my phone in at least once more each day. It really does hold the rest of the phone back; the performance is good for gaming, the camera is good for... camera-ing, but in order to do either of those things for extended periods of time, you're tied to a wall or battery backup.- Support. Nextbit got bought out and this phone is going the way of Windows Phone, which is to say that it's pretty much neglected and unsupported by the company that made it. If it breaks, you're on your own.- Nextbit Home launcher. This is a nit-pick and obviously you can replace it, but there's no widget support. The Launcher itself is laggy and really does the rest of the phone injustice. If an uninformed user were to just pick this up and use it, they'd put it down and get an iPhone.- No included charger brick. I used the one from my LG G2 which works, but if you want faster charging, you'll really have to do some research to find a good power adapter. While I put the cable in the OK category, they do this stupid one-sided USB connector on the other side of it that is not only unnecessary, but annoying.Overall, for the price, you really CANT get a better phone. Blu has some nice offerings, but it's basically russian roulette as to which ones come with the chinese malware. If you were to look for LG or Samsung at this price, you'd get one of their budget offerings at best, and the Nextbit Robin would beat it in every category.Let me put it this way, if you have 300 to spend on a phone, buy this one and spend the rest on pizza. Lots of pizza.",2017年8月8日 在美国审核
Skyrocketing price says a lot.,"When I purchased this phone a couple of years ago, it was $120. Now? Well, you can see for yourself. I was amazed at how cheap the phone was, what I didn't realize at the time was that it was no longer being supported by the manufacturer. If you buy this stock, the last security update was during the summer of 2017. Do keep this in mind when considering your purchase.I've tried a couple of other phones since then, newer phones and at the time, more costly. They were garbage compared to this one. I came back here hoping to buy another, but I'm not going to shell out $350 for a phone no longer being supported. The one I have is fine, but I know one day I'll drop it, it'll crack and I'll have to move on. A backup would be nice.Every person who has seen the Mint version of my phone has asked me about it. It's a work of art, something I wish Razer, the company that purchased Nextbit, would have continued. Instead they just made it look like every other phone on the market. Boring black. Generic name. Nothing exceptional to look at.Cons:Battery life. You can go down 20% in just 10-15 minutes of usage playing a game.Security. There is none. It's a gaping security hole due to the lack of support.Age. It is an older phone and getting older.Pros:Wifi calling.Gyroscope. This will give you a somewhat blurry &amp; cheap VR experience.Form. Again, it's a beautiful phone. No other phone on the market compares.Secret tip. You can wipe the OS off the phone and replace it with something more modern and secure. You do have to have a fair bit of tech savvy to accomplish this. You also lose the wifi calling feature.Final verdict: It's a great phone, but at its current price point, not worth purchasing.",2019年7月24日 在美国审核
I really like this phone!,"I purchased this phone new from Amazon.It was listed at $129.There were a few cheaper listings, but this was fulfilled by Amazon and brand-new, so I got it instead to be safe.For the price, this is a superb phone.I believe the original price was around $400 at initial release, so you can't beat it for the specs.The processor is Snapdragon 808, so it might run a little warm, but since I don't play any intense games, I'm sure the phone will not overheat on me.Out of the box, the battery needed to be recharged before I could use the phone.It takes about 2 hours or so to fully charge, so that's plenty fast.The cable is USB C, so it doesn't matter how you plug it in. Less stumbling around in the dark trying to plug in the cable correctly!I've heard some stories about poor quality cable, but so far, on day two for me, it works fine.At the start, the phone will take about a DAY to download and install OS updates, depending on how fast your wifi is.For me, it downloaded about 2GB (!) to get to Marshmallow (what was it before?).Then, it took about 1.5 GB to get to Nougat 7 and finally to 7.1.1.The phone initially stalled at the 7.1.1 download and wouldn't install it.I solved that with a factory reset, re-download 7.1.1, install, and done!I chose the Midnight color, but the mint is a more cheerful option, if you prefer.I also DESPISE the Google bar that won't go away, so I downloaded Nova Launcher, chose a black wallpaper, and got rid of the Google bar.You can also eliminate the Nextbit Cloud button this way, too.Does Cloud still work?It was the key feature of this phone, but now that Razr has bought out the company and will soon stop support, cloud storage may be gone.The phone itself has 32GB storage but no expansion slot.Keep this in mind you if do a lot of music, videos, and games, because with no Cloud, 32GB is all you're going to get.Luckily, there is virtually no bloatware.The bootloader is unlocked, in case you have the techical savvy and willpower to load up a custom ROM.However, since you get a virtually stock Nougat 7.1.1, that is probably not necessary.The phone has 3GB RAM and runs silky smooth with Nougat 7.1.1.The camera seems fine and I experienced no lag with taking pictures.The quality of the images is good, too, not but to Iphone 7+ standards but still good.The fingerprint scanner was temperamental, though.Sometimes it reads, sometimes it doesn't even after multiple attempts. The easiest thing to do is probably to just disable this feature altogether.The phone itself feels well-built and sturdy enough. It's slightly slippery for me, so if you're a clumsy person, I'd recommend a case, just to be safe.The phone has two front speakers, one on top and one on the bottom (it's a speaker, not a home button, although it looks like the iPhone button).Sound quality is decent, although I prefer to use headphones (there is a jack for this).My Nextbit Robin is unlocked, so I can take it outside the country.Would I recommend this phone?Yes!It makes for a great backup phone with near-premium specs for a very low budget price.",2017年8月8日 在美国审核
I love this phone so much for the price,"I couldn't wait to write a review about this phone. I wanted to use it for about 2-3 weeks so that I can feel confident talking about it. I have been using Samsung for a while now. My latest was the Note 4 which I purchased almost 2 year ago. I had an ink spill last year August and had to send it to Samsung to fix which they charged meabout $189. 00. Then in January, I was charging the Samsung and all of a sudden I have a dead screen. Phone did not hit the ground or anything. I called Samsung again I do not have any warranty so I have to pay for this fix which I was not ready to do. So I came to Amazon to get an unlocked phone for not more $200 since I am so over these overrate galaxy's notes and IPhones with their exorbitant prices. Then I met Robin. I love this phone so much for the price. The space is incredible. The phone comes in such a beautiful packaging. It comes with nice apps already installed. No junk so you are actually receiving almost all the 32 GB they say the phone comes with locally. And the cloud storage feature which I have not even tackled yet. It has great speed, for the price, Camera is not that bad. Finger printing feature is very stylish. Battery life is good for me. I charge and use it all day. My Samsung never lasted me all day. I may be at 70% and then take 3 pictures and then the phone will go dead. I think I should end here since I can go on and on..I Love love this phone. don't waste your money on",2017年2月7日 在美国审核
Sweet unique phone!,"Overall i highly recommend this phone, i feel as though it is the best value on the market right now priced at 150USD as of 1/9/2017Things I LIKE about this device-the screen, its very crisp and colorful-the front facing speakers are very nice for watching videos and speakerphone calls-the cloud storage function is unique and cool-the fingerprint reader works well 9 times out of 10, and its placed very well. this is my first phone with a fingerprint reader and im quite impressed by the tech-the processor and RAM are very nice, i haven't seen any slowdowns on this phone-the WiFi adapter must be pretty quick i have very fast download times on this device-its fully compatible with my network including 4G LTE (tmobile)-it looks, feels, and runs like a premium device, despite the price-the built in apps (messaging, phone, contacts) are nice-there is no bloat software to take up space and never be used, more phone makers should do this!-USB-C is the future and this connector and cable is awesome!Things I DON'T like-the display is not AMOLED, which would have made the display much more vibrant-the screen has a mild amount of ghosting, but it took me about a week to notice that at all, its not a huge deal.-NO MICROSD, but the cloud storage kind of makes up for that.-the phone is slightly too big for me, i feel like i have to use both of my hands to use the device, again its only a 5.2 inch screen, the trend right now is 5.5 inch screens, which would be too big to operate comfortably.-the speakers don't sound amazing, but its only phone speakers, they usually don't sound amazing, but at least they are loud-non removable battery, im so tired of this on modern phonesADDITIONAL OPINIONS-the downside to this phone using USB-C is that its so new, that i don't have any spare cables, the only cable that i own is the one included with the device, but that's not really an issue with the phoneI was extremely picky in looking for phones, my previous phone was a galaxy s3 that had become so worn out that it was basically unusable. i wanted a phone that would be an upgrade in almost every department, such as-android 6 from the factory-under 5 inch screen-made in 2016-removable battery-1080p AMOLED screen-microsd card slotThat's all i needed, and believe it or not there are no phones that check ALL of these boxes that were within my budget (under 300USD), so i had to settle on something at some point. i could have got a galaxy s5, but it was made in 2014, and im so sick of Samsung products breaking on me. I also looked at Motorola products and they didn't impress me for the price, that being said the Motorola G4 plus was a serious contender for my next phone. then i found the nextbit robin after my friend bought one, and i was initially drawn to it because it ticks enough boxes that i was willing to compromise at that price point. it just doesn't use an AMOLED screen, or have amicrosd slot, or a removable battery, which i would kill for, but i don't think i will ever get a phone perfect for me if i want a brand new phone in a market dominated by phablets and limited to no expandable memory",2017年1月9日 在美国审核
Good replacement for Nexus5X of you can't afford Pixel like me,"Summary:. This model is an older one and can't be compared fairly to the most high end Android devices out now (Samsung, Pixel, OnePlus, etc).However, it is the best and most cost effective replacement I've found on Amazon for my Nexus 5X.So this review will compare these two devices.Pro:--Same resolution screen as the 5X--Less than half the price if you were to buy a 5X (new condition) even in 2018--Better Ram and double local storage capacity than the base 5X model--Has a headphone jack--Can re-use the same USB-C charger from the 5X (or most any other power accessories bought for the 5X)--Can install other roms, launchers, etc., and is rootable compared to even dual booting in the 5XCon:--Built in camera is like a lower-end Samsung model - pics come out much darker and grainier than the 5X--Fingerprint reader surface area is narrow and doesn't work most of the time - 5X had a much better finger print reader and worked well with unlocking the phone or apps--Max OS is Android 7.1.1 for this phone - while the 5X can be upgraded to the latest 8.x OS--Runs hot for YouTube and other videos because of the older 808 processorConclusion:. I've used this phone for the past month and like it.It has a comparable battery life to the 5X, and despite feeling fragile, has survived several drops without a scratch.After using the Nexus 4, 5, 5x, and the 6p, I really wanted as pure (non-bloatware) Android device as possible.This phone fit both my budget and minimum hardware/software requirements.",2018年2月2日 在美国审核
My FAVORITE PHONE EVER (but has a crummy camera),"So, first off, I'll start with my one caveat/con: The camera on this phone is straight up awful. Grainy yuck photos and even worse if you aren't taking them on the surface of the sun (brightness). The only other thing I'd say negatively is possibly that the battery isn't super great..? But it lasts me a day or so, so it seems standard (my iphone and galaxy lasted me a few hours, I'm a heavy user). I would suggest this is NOT a great phone for playing games on because that IS where the battery life starts to play in and will be sapped quickly by many popular games.Now, once you move past that, this phone is actually AMAZING. There are several things about it that stand out for me:Gimmick: Okay I always forget this is a thing but its gimmick is that it can upload your unused apps to the cloud as they are so you don't have to uninstall them (and they keep their saved data, like games etc). I don't use this that much since the phone comes with 32GB storage which is GREAT and more than enough for my needs. It does work as advertised and I have used it to put away games I've beaten that take up a lot of space.Android: The phone, despite being a super cheap phone, is actually VERY well supported. I've been in the beta program and getting weekly updates and I know that regular users are currently still getting updates. It's on Android 7.1 I believe currently and it's actually fantastic. It was one of the first phones to have Android 7, mainly just because this phone is well supported. Even after they got bought out by Razer they've still been sending updates at a regular schedule. Oh, and they also didn't put any weird phone-breaking ""protection"" like a lot of phones (Galaxy/iPhone) have so you can root this phone pretty easily! A few people I know use this phone for software work and games exclusively.Screen: The brightness is actually pretty impressive and the colors are great. I don't think it's the most dense display out there by far but it's big and certainly dense enough for me not to see individual pixels.Speed: The phone seems to run pretty snappy, apps open and close on time. I haven't noticed any sort of lag. There have been a few bugs but only since I entered the beta program and, well, it's unstable builds that I've been getting so that goes with the territory. I never had any issues before entering beta and I assume that's the case for regular users of the phone.THE CASE: Okay I had to get here eventually. I've actually never cared about the exterior of a phone before. Most phones (iPhones included) are kind of ugly and uninspired designs trying desperately to reinvent something from 2004. This is one of the only phones I've ever seen IN MY LIFE that when I looked at it I went ""wow, that's pretty."" When I GOT IT I pretty much freaked out about how gorgeous this thing is. I got the mint version (OF COURSE) and it's so beautiful. A lot of my friends with $800+ are EXTREMELY jealous of my phone and have even said they've considered swapping because of how gorgeous this phone is. I take it out of the protective case I have it in all the time to show people. I'm paranoid about phones breaking so I keep it in a case all the time, but if you're one of those very-careful no-case users this would be a great phone to use. It feels good in your hand, it's a great shape, the matte exterior has great grip, it looks beautiful, doesn't collect fingerprints, and is just... stunning. I can't reccommend the aesthetics of this phone enough. Mint is such a great color for women and even men who are even remotely fashion conscious. I really never thought I'd care what my phone looked like but here we are.Overall this is a great phone that was absolutely fantastic at $300 but now at $150 (at the time of this review) the phone is kind of unbelievable. This is such a great deal. I've gotten multiple friends to get this phone by now and continue to sing its praises. Over 6 months with this phone and I'm still so enamoured by it.People who should buy this phone:- Anyone who cares about fashion or design- Anyone who likes unique and interesting gadgets- Someone looking for a cheap but good phone for using social media, texting- Someone who doesn't care much about photo quality in phones- Parents buying a phone for their teens (but I'm not sure if this has any parental controls or anything like that)- Anyone who has a Galaxy S5, iPhone 4, and thinks an upgrade that only costs $150 is a good deal- Anyone who wants to root a phone but doesn't need heavy battery life (I hear Cyanogen Mods sometimes seep battery)Phones I've had (and liked far less)DroidGalaxy S 3Galaxy S 4Galaxy S 5Nexus 6LG G3iPhone 6 Plus (tho I miss the camera but everything else sucked)",2017年5月24日 在美国审核
Pros and Cons - but keeping it because it's a good deal.,"Really good deal for what you get.PROS:* Fast interface - as fast or better than the LG G3 that died on me.* Design and feel are excellent - many say it feels 'plastic' but I disagree - seems quality to me and easy to hold.* No slip - I had an LG and a Samflung S6 Edge that were way more slippry.* NO BLOATWARE! - nough said.* Screen is bright and colors are good.* Fingerprint reader is insanely fast - take note Samsung, the fprint reader Nextbit uses is lightning fast.* Type C USB connection is great and what all s=phone should have now - multidirectional!* Battery life is perfect for my moderate use, and the phone charges an hour.* Headphone jack on top of phone - where it should be.CONS:* Finding the power/fingerprint reader in the dark is tough if not frustrating.* Can not use widgets in a sane, normal way - must pinch screen - retarded.* Can not get rid of the Google Search bar if you active Google app...why? Mystery.* Camera is hit or miss...when it feels like it, it will focus - but it's a crap shoot.* For whatever reason you can not set a diff wallpaper for lock screen than home screen...?* LED notification light is on the bottom of the phone - retarded.* Have had issues with Wifi keeping connection when the signal is weak...doesn't seem to auto reconnect.Overall I like the 'monolith' Robin and am keeping it, because for $145 there is no better deal on Amazon.",2017年1月21日 在美国审核
Great phone.,"I love this phone.I have been wanting it since I saw the Kickstart a while ago.It was 400 plus dollars. When I saw that Amazon for 169.00 I had to buy it.Even with the mixed reviews. This phone has a great signal and it gets TMobile's and AT &amp; T LTE and Volte.I saw wifi calling in the settings. But I haven't tried it yet (I never use WiFi calling). Since I have had this phone it's been updated to Android N.I have a Samsung S7edge, Moto Z,LG stylo plus,Moto G plus 64G 4 g of ram version.Sony z 4,and a few others.This is thefirst phone to get Android N. I don't have issues with the phone getting hot. The build quality is excellent.The sounds perfect for me. It's loud and clear.I usually use headphones.I do use speaker phone sometimes for calls.It works good.Call quality on and off speaker are great. The only thing with thisphone is.If you use a case use one of the Nextbit cases.The third-party cases fit but it's hard to get to the buttons that are fairly flat. With the nextbit cases this is not a problem.The cases are a bit pricey, but they are awsome for the phone and worth it.I don't like the Nextbit launcher, I don't like my icons all diffrent colors, sizes and just plopped on all the screens.Not a big deal.I always use Nova prime on all my phones. It lets me customize my phone how I like.Nice and neat.I have the midnight version of the phone. The mint color is all over the the UI.I wish I could change thisto dark.All in all its a great phone for the price.",2016年12月4日 在美国审核

Design is personal but if you love stand out of the crowd minimalist design with an almost stock OS then this is prefect!,"Great phone. Cant believe its so cheap. have been using it as my daily since purchase and I can honestly say its never let me down. Its as close to stock android as you are going to get without getting a google phone.Its slim, light but not awkwardly so. Its pretty sturdy although I wouldn't want to sit on it if in the back pocket. But who puts a phone there? Not me.The screen is bright although living LA the screen can seem a bit dim at times if the sun is blazing. Not a major headache as I am not one of those LA types that is constantly on my phone, even with other people in company.The speakers are awesome and kick out a good level of detail and volume without breaking up.Camera is superb. Not had any major problems with it. I am a photographer and appreciate the use of manual camera settings which as expected give you far superior results.The 4K video is good, although i have not worked with it too many times. So can't comment with confidence on it.One issue i have with it is when i have the phone attached to a speaker and i answer a call. The caller finds it super hard to hear me. I am guessing there is an issue when connected in this way, as when i talk to a caller normally via the phone speaker, there seems to be no issue.Maybe the microphone needs a firmware update or an actual physical change? Again not a deal breaker as not often you would have it physically attached to a speaker unless its bluetooth.Another small issue is it came to me with a slight bump on the back. Barely visible unless you are flat up against it with your eye. Again not an issue for me as i have theTUDIA case on it and as I mentioned, barely visible. I am guessing its down to th build being mostly plastic. / hard plastic. Maybe a heat thing?Talking of heat. I don't find it gets that hot as some other have mentioned. No hotter than any other phone i have had. Including samsung etc.The OS is beautifully simple. No bloat ware. The 3gigs or ram helps. But i have never felt it lagging. I never find myself waiting and waiting. The camera if activated from the OFF status can be a bit laggy. But bare in mind it has to turn on the screen then jump into the camera. Otherwise it all runs smoothly. Hoping they can speed this up a little with the next firmware update.The phone charges super quick and comes with a flat USB type-c cord. Its nice an baby blue which has ha people remarking on how nice it was.In fact i have had more people asking me about this phone than any other i have had. I love the shape and size and the fact that its so simple and yet looks less boring than all the other generic phones out there now.A huge thumbs up for design!The notification light is on the bottom of the phone rather than the standard top of he screen etc. At first I was unsure but the more i use it the more it makes so much more sense. Its not like you are always OVER your phone at a meeting etc. With the light at the bottom where the power lead goes i can still see it slowly flashing. Even when I am at my mac, as i am now, the phone is next to me but i am not over it. so i can see the little notification light. And if i am across the room i can see the light on the bottom. Again I think a genius idea and thought process.I wouldlove the ability to change light colors depending on what media has come in. Say have the choice of orange, baby blue and white, as we have now. Would be pretty easy to do.Battery life is middle of the road. With general to busy use i can get a whole day out of it. And as its a quick charger (with the fast charger) I never feel I have ran out of juice.To close. I looked long and hard for a phone that was different and one that would just do what it was meant to do without problems. The idea of spending $700 on a samsung just made me sick. Why? Why spend that cash on a bloated phone? I also didnt want an iPhone as its too closed in and pretty much useless to anyone wanting to modify anything of use.My last option would have been a google phone. My end choices were the Pixel, Nexus or the Nextbit Robin.I went for the Robin as i loved the design and IDEA behind the phone and company.The Nextbit Robin just works. And it does it with a very simple and uncluttered design and OS. Its unassuming and yet when people see it they instantly want to pick it up and have a look.Others have had issues with it. Maybe they are the types to hammer the phone daily. I personally use it for email, social media and planning my week. I watch netflix now and then and listen to pandora. Don't play games on it. Use whatsapp use the camera. A LOT.It may just be the phone you need. Especially at this price!",2017年1月4日 在美国审核
Amazing Phone,"Was looking for a new phone under $200. Comparing this phone at $169.99 to the Huwaei Honor 5x at 159.99 and Asus Zenfone 3 Laser at 199.99 at 1/26/2017.My sister got my parents 2 Honor 5X for black friday for like $125 and they were pretty great for the price. However, she got it from a different website, and the majority of the reviews recently, 11/16 - 01/17, on amazon for the Honor 5X were super bad. With both phones close in price, the Nextbit Robin's specs were much better. The only thing i liked about the Honor 5x over the robin is the metal body.The Asus Zenfone 3 laser had good reviews, decent specs, and i really like its design and colors. However, the US variant of the phone only came with 2gb ram, did not support T-mobile Band 12 LTE, and had a weaker cpu than the cheaper Honor 5x and the Robin's.Overall, the Robin had equal or better specs than both of those phones and literally all other phones currently under $200. This phone + case + screen protector came out to be $185.88.PROS~Snapdragon 808 + 3GB Ram = Fast speed, no lag so far32GB Storage + 100GB cloud Storage = good amount of storage for average users and free cloud storage if you ever have to muchSupports Band 12 T-mobile LTEFingerprint Scanner, thought it was gonna suck, but works great so far.*Haven't tried out the camera, but heard it was good*Dual Sim supportGood community support and firmware updates (currently 1/26/2017 android nougat is in beta testing)CONS~Limited phone cases and phone colorBack heats up a bit when charging phone and using itAverage battery life, lets hope Nougat helps it out a bit moreDoesn't come with wall charger, it's not a con for some, but i only have a regular wall charger, need to go get one with quick charge.But dam, do i love this phone so far.

Sometimes you really can get a great product at a great price,"Here are me reasons for going with it:1 - Interaction with the manufacturer usually doesn't happen so a manufacturer that's been bought out doesn't matter as long as the new company covers the warranty - and Razer has the capital to cover that.2 - It's last years H/W (equivalent to Samsung S6 IMO) at an incredible price ~$150 vs ~$3503 - It's running near to stock Android (6.0.1 with a commitment to go to 7.x) with no bloatware - only tweak is to add a ""cloud backup"" component4 - It's like getting a Pixel if Google were to have made one last year5 - A tech friend a work has one and gave it very good marksHow it's been after 3 days of use:Great! A bit larger than my old phone so it doesn't quite fit on my pocket - or feel ""right"" - but I'm sure I'll get used to it soon (I put my phone in my front pocket).The way I hold the phone while playing games means the corner tends to poke a bit into my palm (the corners are a bit sharper than my old S4) but a slight modification of my grip solves that.The placement of the fingerprint reader on the power button is a stroke of genius - one press and you turn on and unlock your phone.No need to place a finger in one place while pressing the power button with another finger.This is my first use of a fingerprint reader - not sure exactly how other manufacturers have implemented it but it seems to me this is the best solution.I still have a password in case something goes wrong with the scanner (and for boot encryption - just dot it!), but having used the scanner for 3 days I hope it never breaks!Unless you've ever purchased an unlocked phone (or stock Android) you have no idea how nice it is to uninstall all that bloatware - goodbye all those ATT apps you don't use, goodbye all those 3rd party apps your manufacturer and provider force on you (I have nothing against any of them, I just don't like being forced to update apps I don't use). (I do miss the Samsung launcher though - when will Google put some serious time into the launcher?Perhaps they'll release the Pixel launcher?)",2017年2月9日 在美国审核
I bought this phone for minimal expense in case I did not like android. I actually like the kitschy little Nextbit,"So I bought this phone about six months ago because it was very cheap. This was after the announcement Nextbit was being purchased by Razer. I didn't have high expectations for this phone. I was a lifelong iPhone user that was itching for change and becoming more ingrained in the Google side of things. I bought this phone for minimal expense in case I did not like android. I actuallylike the kitschy little Nextbit. For the money, the specs and even the look , its a really good deal. I've had no issues out of mine and it's actually a conversation piece amongst device enthusiasts. Itruns a very pure version of android, which was I now know I prefer, because I decided to purchase a flagship galaxy S8 and honestly don't care for Samsung's version of android. This phone even has better audio coming out of the headphone jack compared to the galaxy S8. I will agree with some of the other reviews, the camera could be stronger but it gets the job done. My verdict is a lot of phone for the money and it's kinda cool.",2017年11月18日 在美国审核
I absolutely love this phone,"I am a fairly casual phone user, so take my review with that in mind.That being said, I absolutely love this phone. My iPhone bit the dust and I was at a loss because at this time purchasing another iPhone was just not financially feasible. In fact, the more I researched more ""mainstream"" phones, the more discouraged I was by the price tag. I was convinced I'd have to get a $20 flip phone after years of becoming accustomed to smart phone technology.After I got over the fact that I may have to look outside of the iPhone or Samsung bubble, I found the Nextbit Robin in a list of inexpensive smart phones of decent quality. I read a few more reviews and took my chances.I am so pleased by this phone. This is my first Android, and I was worried about the transition from iOS to Android -- but I think this phone makes that transition a little easier with its minimalist design. I like the feel of it, and the display is very crisp. So far, I have been able to do everything I was doing on my iPhone, and I actually like the home button and fingerprint detection a lot more than the iPhone 6; when you set it up, you can move your finger around to ensure every part of your print is identified, so you don't have to place it ""just so"" every time like I had to with my iPhone.Many of the reviews I read mentioned the camera and battery life as mediocre at best, and while the camera definitely isn't as powerful as the iPhone's, I don't think it's really fair to expect that level of quality from a $150 phone. I feel like the camera is more than adequate for that price, and I would argue that the front-facing photos I've taken are actually better than my iPhone's. I may be imagining it, but they do seem less grainy to me. As for the battery life, once again, I am a casual phone user (and I have a small child who can't see a phone without wanting it, so a lot of times it's simply out of sight) so your mileage may vary, but I have not had an issue at all so far with the battery life.The only complaint I will echo is that the phone does seem to get warm quickly.

Great Budget phone that also happens to look very sharp,"This phone is a great value.I have yet to have a single issue with it.The battery life isn't that amazing but it's serviceable and you will make it through a normal workday or day out under most circumstances.If you're going to an event and want to use it all day just make sure you have a portable usb charger with you.I was able to get through an entire race day at the track and I took many pictures and still had ~20% battery but your mileage may vary.I don't have any battery crazy draining apps like facebook installed and I'm not as heavy of a user as many people are.I prefer using an actual computer whenever possible.USB-C is just awesome and is a million times better than micro usb. The included USB-C cord is a quality cord that's held up just fine too.The phone is very sharp looking and has even gotten a compliment by a coworker.Most people are shocked when you tell them how little you paid.It comes in sturdy, good looking packaging too. (Not that it matters to most)This is a great alternative for anyone looking for a budget phone that's still capable of doing everything a flagship phone can.The fingerprint scanner works very well and it's very fast. The fingerprint scanner give you up to 5 slots to program different fingers. It has you place your finger on the button in about a dozen different angles so what I did was just go ahead and program all 5 slots with the same two fingers I would use to unlock it.That way it has as many angles as possible and ensures it will read your print even from an odd angle. This little trick really does help make sure it unlocks consistently.The volume buttons work well and I like that they are two individual buttons instead of a rocker button so you don't end up making the wrong adjustment.The phone also has a little status LED that pulses when you get a new notification and stays on to indicate it's connected to a charger. .The camera LED is pretty bright too and is actually brighter than some other phones I have.The nice thing about this phone is that it's by far the best value in it's price range.Since it's such a value I didn't bother with a case for it since I like to keep phones slim and it's just a cool looking phone and it would be a shame to cover it upI have propped it a few times and it's held up just fine but one time the back cover kinda pooped out a bit but with a little squeeze popped right together. This was after a tumble down about 10 steps on a aluminum bleachers.It seems fairly scratch resistant too because it just doesn't seem to pick up little scratches so the kinda flat/satin black finish seems to hold up fine Not sure about the other color but the blue/green color seems very ugly to me. The cloud storage is handy &amp; very fast so it would be great for anyone who takes a bunch of pictures. You just don't need to worry about running out of space especially if you allow it to upload to the could when it's on mobile date/not on a charger.When I inserted my straight talk SIM card (that I actually cut down to nano size myself from micro using scissors and sand paper. surprisingly easy but I wouldn't recommend it if you're not very handy) it automatically pulled all the APN settings from the sim since it must have saved to the sim from my previous samsung phone and worked perfectly immediately. I thought that was cool since I didn't have to mess with any APN settings.in Summary - This is a great budget phone that's very hard to beat for it's price. No it's not a Galaxy S7 or Iphone 7 but it's a great phone for it's price point.It takes decent enough pictures, seems to get good signal, feels good in the hand, looks sharp, runs all my apps and games just fin.I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a budget phone that just.....works.I purchased this after looking around for over a month and finally settled on this and I'm glad I did. If you're someone who is hard on phones and doesn't want to worry about breaking or loosing a $600+ phone this is a great option.It also looks like an expensive phone while some of the other options in this range just look a bit ""cheap""i would hive this phone a 90 out of 100 but I gave it 5 stars since 4 just wouldn't be fair due to its great value",2017年9月16日 在美国审核
This is a fantastic phone for the price.,"This is a plastic phone but it's a very nice plastic, I don't use a case and it's worn some but for the price I don't care because it's not a fashion accessory!The corners are sharp and dig into your hands at first, it takes some getting use to but it's no longer an issue for me.The notification light is an all but useless pin prick on the bottom edge that's monochrome, it really miss the RGB LED of my Nexus 4.The ambient light sensor is sensitive and it sits under your thumb when you flip to landscape mode making the screen go dim, it's dumb.The screen is beautiful, crisp, and clear.The camera takes decent photos.The OS is close to stock Android with only the now useless Nextbit Robin features lingering around, no bloatware.The edges are perfectly square which means you can balance it on edge, this proves to be useful for the flashlight at times when you need both hands.For under $125 you could do a lot worse but I doubt you could do better.I'm happy with the phone and will use it until it dies and for the price I won't be too upset if it lasts a year.",2017年11月30日 在美国审核
Easily THE best phone by specs vs price,"Very good phone. I go through a lot of phones, and none are perfect. This is no exception. A few things make no sense like where the notification light is when there would have been room to put it where all the other phones do AND use the rear ""cloud"" lights for notifications, too. Would have been, sadly really, a ground-breaking setup. Then the build quality. It's plastic. So it's cheap to make, but it's also, well, plastic. Aaaand then there's the power button. I'm sorry, but fingerprint reading is a fad that needed to die too long ago. In the setup the phone even tells you it's not a secure way to handle unlocking, and making the power button completely flush(I assume in the interest of making the button also the reader) with the phone body was just stupid. Makes it super annoying to have a case, which you want with this phone, and still use it. There are workarounds for this, but there shouldn't need to be.That said, I'd buy it again, and I did for my wife. Because in spite of the cons it ROCKS! 3rd party support is great, battery life is stellar, the cameras are good, performance is awesome, and the speakers setup is genius. It's a great phone. Buy it!",2017年9月28日 在美国审核
Different in a good way,"The design is great. Corners are a little Sharp but repositioning it in your hand easily finds a sweet spot because it's very light and evenly balanced. It's slick it's different but everything seems really thought out as far as where the camera,speakers, charging port and fingerprint scanner are located. Now after having time to use the device I have some cons... The speakers while front facing are either too low or maxed out and that's not all that loud. They have good sound but they may be the worst speakers I've ever heard volume wise. The battery is cool and you can get through a whole day with moderate use.I like where the fingerprint scanner is but because it's flush with the side it's sometimes hard to find it quickly. Besides that I still like the phone but I can understand why they don't want to move forward with it besides the design there's really nothing special about it. But honestly if they stretched the screen edge to edge eliminating the screen bezel with some performance upgrades I would be on it. #RazerRobin",2017年8月17日 在美国审核
"Great phone, do the updates!","I was interested in this phone when it was on Kickstarter, but could not bring myself to pay $400 for this phone compared to the offerings of other companies like OnePlus.There were quite a few negative bits written about the battery life and the camera quality and speed.When I initially turned it on and it connected to wifi it downloaded and installed a series of updates.This took quite a while but I assume that they took care of quite a few problems that others were having.The battery life issue seems to have been fixed, I can use it casually all day with no problems.The camera shutter lag also appears to be gone.I do not care for the lack of an app drawer, that is a feature that I very much enjoy about android and one of the reasons that I switched from the iPhone a few years ago.I am currently using it with Nokia's Z launcher and love it.It is quick, it still automatically uploads and stores my files, great phone.At the $150 it is currently, this is a great buy compared to other phones in it's price range.",2017年4月3日 在美国审核
Great phone at great price,"It's fast it's bright it looks different and it's got juuuuuust about everything a phone should have. I use Net10 and, aside from having to get a new NANO sim card for service, the transition worked fine. As far as I'm concerned, people can argue about processor speed, display size and resolution, whatever, but none of that matters if you're looking for a reliable phone on a budget. THIS IS THAT PHONE FOR THAT BUDGET.Yeah it's not a fancy metal frame (and it does flex a little) butUSB C quick charging means I don't have to beg bartenders for a quick hit of electron juice when I go out after a long day. Splurge and get yourself a proper extra cable and quick charger (Anker of course, but try to grab them on sale) and this leads me to the only negative - this is a sealed phone. You got the battery you got, and it's not as deep as some others I've had. I got used to having a backup(or two) charged battery, easily swapped out on the cheaper Samsungs I've always used, instant full charge no waiting and no cables. I guess I'll just have to lug a power core or kmashi battery pack with me now.But it's faaaassst and the custom interface is nice and it's really a different kind of phone, I catch people trying to figure out what it is around Portland which is funny 'cause they've got the newest Samsung and they like mine better.Throw in multiple hotspot/mobile wifi options, automatic Android updates, and twin speakers and you've got a great phone for the price.I really hope this company does well and keeps making phones.",2017年7月7日 在美国审核
Excellent phone with average specs,"Okay, I've been searching forever for a phone that can keep going over a period longer than 24 hours at a time with normal usage, or at least 12 hours under higher-than-normal usage, and this is the phone. I was hesitant because of the mAh rating of the batter, but nexbit have managed to assemble a coherent combination of hardware and software to make a snappy phone that's just what you need, and nothing more.An average camera, average screen size and resolution, and average specs, the nexbit doesn't stick out in that department, but it is the most functional and CLEAN phone I have used in a long time, eclipsing the G3/4/5 and Moto X series (any of them) at often a fraction of the cost. The fingerprint reader is snappy and clever, and the OEM OS isn't weighed down by bloatware and wasted features. It is the most true-to-android system I have used in a while, and the performance and battery life prove that less is more.Charging is fast-- not as fast as some others, but plenty fast, and I often get nearly two full days out of the phone before I need to recharge.The finish is excellent and more comfortable than many competing phones.For the price there is no competition.",2016年12月13日 在美国审核
Great phone for a great deal!!,"i guess this phone is a hit or miss with some people (makes me think most of the people that gave it lower ratings are just picky).I for one love it and have had no issues with it.Visually its one of the best looking phones I've laid my eyes on.Once you turn it on it'll go thru a software update launch (took me about 3 updates to get to current Nougat 7.0).Battery life isn't bad (compared to my old Nexus 6), quick charge juices up your battery super quick.Front speakers aren't as loud as the Nexus and the screen colors are a little white washed but none of these issues are a deal breaker for me.I have the cloud storage turned off since 32 GB is more than enough for me.Phone runs smoothly with zero lag (I've had it for 2 weeks now).Overall I'm a sucker for a good deal and for $150 it doesn't get any better than this.",2017年4月7日 在美国审核
My Robin,"I'm extremely impressed for the price. I'll describe what I like about this phone and then I'll describe where I'm coming from so that a reader may judge the relevancy of my review.The screen is crisp, the buttons easy and intuitive. It is responsive. It is loud and clear. I am happy with the camera. I've not yet played with the video recorder. They stock keypad is accurate both hen pecking and swyping. The reception - wow. None of my past or any of my families current phones have had reception like this. The styling is unique; I think a person will either love it or hate it. I like it. It fits well in my hand.Where am I coming from? For reception I'm comparing against a OnePlus One, Meizu M2 Note, Kindle Fire Phone, LG K10, Blu R1 HD.I myself most recently used an LG K10 short term after breaking my OnePlus One. The LG was lousy, but for an entry level phone I guess it was acceptable. The Robin is no OnePlus, however, the only things I really am missing from my OnePlus are multi color notification lights and double tap to open. Considering even a used OnePlus well exceeds the cost of the Robin I'm not complaining...and so far I have far fewer quirks.",2017年1月3日 在美国审核
"This is one great device! If you're lucky reading this, please get this phone.","I waited a whole week to use this phone after receiving it and I can honestly tell you, based on cost, functionality and quality, this is by far one of the best phones out there now.Coming from everything Samsung, especially the Galaxy series, I had high hopes for Note 7, so I skipped note 5. My Note 4 was so erratic as anyone using all these phones know that you can hardly get anything great after over one year of good usage. My Note was slow in everything and I was contemplating waiting it out for Galaxy 8 edge or even Note 8.I then decided to give ""middle entry or very low cost phones"" a try.To be honest. Nextbit beat my imagination and performed beyond my expectations.Unlike many phones, this is one great superb gadget. It was not loaded with many bloatware, boots promptly and neatly, runs very smoothly. I think the 3G ram is way more than enough for running everything - and I literarily run everything on my phones. Schedules, Movies, Sound, whatsapp, video calls and lots more.With 32GB and 100GB cloud storage (though I would prefer a SD slot too), I don't see how you can go wrong for a device running stock android seamlessly for about $150.I was shocked to read some negative reviews. I concluded some who wrote anything funny about this phone got a defective gadget.If you're lucky as I a few days ago, and you just to stumbled on this phone, and you're reading this right now, I advise you to just buy this phone. I told my wife that I am sure the cost will go way high when many people discover Nexbit Robin.Downside; I have some problem with the name - name of the phone and company.

The so called rebels sold out and we're acquired by Razer and decided to no longer honor their warranty and customer service. I bought my phone on February and my power button is not functioning at all. I decided to reach out to the manufacturer only to get as far as their website to find out that they were not servicing phones since the summer given them being acquired and Razer not caring for their once so called rebels. I turned to Amazon who said they could not help me given it is past 30 day purchase. I have ultimately reached out to the seller in hopes of some help, but I doubt it. It's to see how customers can be set aside once a company moves on to bigger better things.

"Decent phone if you can catch it on sale.  Otherwise, there are better options.","I like this phone a lot, and it's much better than the Moto G3 I had been using previously.The good:This phone is quick, as you would expect from a Snapdragon 808 and 3GB ram.It's attractive and unique.The screen is bright and replicates color nicely - it's actually a very attractive display.I love the unlock button placement, and the fingerprint reader is quite accurate.Camera issues look to have been solved with Android M.The phone is generally very attractive and enjoyable to use.The bad:This phone is all-plastic and it feels like it.It seems pretty delicate, and I would be scared to sit on it without a case, so I'll be investing in one of those.The speakers also don't sound as great as you would expect from the size and placement.Volume buttons are positioned awkwardly.I was initially excited about USB-C but the connection feels a tad rough and prototype-y (there's no satisfying click, and the glide is pretty rough).Bottom line:I bought this device on sale for $199 and I wouldn't pay a penny more than that for it.

Material makes it easy to drop,"The major issue with the phone is that its plastic back is very slippery so it's easy to drop when you take it out of your pocket.

You can get a silicone case but that would hide the exotic rectangular shape of the phone, which was one of its selling points.The phone was pretty good when it worked. Attractive design and good screen. By today's standards (2018) the camera is also good for a budget phone. Like many other non-premium phones it suffers under low light but under daylight it's great.

"For the price, not good. Get something better for the price.","This phone is alright for daily use but I think it is a little expensive compared to some of the phones of this price range. Now this is a cool phone but $240 you can get a much better phone. Some things to mention,-This phone hasn't gotten an update since early 2017(April, 2017) so it is still running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat. And don't expect any new update or security patches either because the company Nextbit was sold to razer.-It's main feature to store things in the cloud doesn't work by default anymore. In fact everything that I had in the cloud got deleted with all the data. Now if you want to store anything in the cloud you have to pay for it.-The software on this phone is very glitchy. I experience lag more often than a cheaper phone. And sometime apps would lag so much that it would crash. For a phone with Snapdragon 808 chip, it should be faster and more optimized for a better user experience.-The camera on this phone is not bad for quick photos but absolutely atrocious for anything more than a snap. The camera has problem focusing on subjects and cannot focus on texts very well. I tried to scan a couple of documents with this camera but the texts were not legible. Same thing if you want to take a picture of your teacher's notes or from the board or even from a digital screen, you will have a tough time focusing. On top of that the camera is so slow. Going back to the point of a Snapdragon 808 phone, a phone with this chip shouldn't be this slow. It takes good one second to snap a picture.-The battery of this phone heats up very quickly and if you watch youtube videos in your bed then it will definitely heat up a lot. The entire phone is made of plastic so you feel the heat directly on your skin. Now I have had $60 phones from ZTE that were also made out of plastic but the battery had a metallic shield on top of it so I didn't feel the heat as much. But from the video from Jerryrigseverything, you can see that the battery is directly attached to the back of this phone so with extensive use or gaming, the phone heats up to the point that it is uncomfortable.Considering you can get older generation iPhones or even Samsung for almost the same price if not cheaper, I wouldn't invest in this product. It's good for daily use but for the price you can get something way better with way more functionality. Phones from Motorala, Huawei or even Xiaomi has much better phones for this price and they will have better support for their phones.***Camera quality included",2018年5月20日 在美国审核
Hacker's Delight,"TLDR:If you're a hacker and love technology, get this device.Ok, so by now everyone reading this should know that this phone has only about 1 year of cloud service left.Additionally, some reviews talk about the 'problems' inherent in the phone's layout and applications.If you like Android phones and just want one that works with no fuss, then stop reading here, this phone is not for you.Here's what myself and other technology enthusiasts are doing with the device:First, I unlocked the bootloader, then I installed a custom recovery program named TWRP.Once I had that installed I selected the Lineage OS (free and open-source operating system for phones), installed that with the help of some YouTube videos, and rooted the device so I can use a linux terminal on my phone, as super-user.I installed a micro-version of the Google apps so I can still use my gmail and gvoice accounts, but without ANY bloatware.I use Privacy Guard to block any apps access to things it doesn't need (yeah, when installing stuff there's that dandy message saying it needs access to your contacts, photo's, etc...This app blocks that - and the apps in question are NOT aware they are being blocked, so you can still use them normally.I can go on and on..Bottom line is that if you want to use a hell of a good piece of hardware and don't mind customizing it to suit your specific tastes (privacy anyone?), then this is THE phone for you.Lineage OS is just one of many ROMS available, there's another one called Resurrection Remix OS that's purportedly faster than Lineage OS, that's next on my list.For the first time, I feel like I have complete control and ownership of a smart-device.And at this price it's a STEAL.",2017年10月6日 在美国审核

Screen easily scratches and issues with the phone not turning on after the battery drains are the major drawbacks I've experienced. The plastic build in my oppinion has helped the screen from shattering when dropped from pocket. Screen will pop out slightly then you just add even pressure to pop it back in.

Great value.,"This phone gets 5 stars for value. When I ordered it in the end of 2016, it had 2014 flagship specs and only cost $170. So why didn't I didn't just get a 2014 flagship then? The answer is updates. Phones that are 2 years old generally don't any more updates which I would lose both security updates and new features from android.Pros:-Value (specs vs price)-Fingerprint scanner works well.-Screen is very nice and clear.-Software updates. The beta version Nougat is already available and a final version should be released soon.-Openness. The company encourages unlocking the bootloader and installing custom ROMs. They even have a section on their website forum devoted to this. Furthermore, this will NOT AFFECT THE WARRANTY. Feel free to play all you want.-The company. The company has been very engaged with it's customers. Very refreshing to see for a phone company.Cons-The camera is sub-par. While the color and white balance are OK, and the pics are fine for social media, when you zoom in they look pixelated and over processed. On the plus side, it does support Camera2 API so you can download other camera apps with advanced features.-No USB OTG. This means that you can't use USB peripherals such as thumb drives.-Limited bluetooth protocols. Things connected over bluetooth like car stereos have no access to your text messaging.Meh (matter of personal taste):-The stock launcher. It doesn't have an app drawer and widgets aren't able to be placed on the wallpaper. You need to pinch the screen to access widgets. This is not a big deal as there are many 3rd party launchers out there.-Cloud storage.

Nextbit Robin has serious performance issues that need to be sorted out,"I really wanted to like this phone. It actually makes a stellar first impression. The packaging is excellent, and the phone design is unique and stylish. When I first picked it up out of the box, I fell in love with the design. It's unlike any other phone on the market. However, upon booting it up, you'll notice the biggest problem this phone has: performance.Simply put, the performance of this phone is unacceptable. Every tiny action you do causes lag and stuttering. Scrolling through the settings menu? The phone stutters. Swiping through the home screen? Stutters. This phone cannot handle the most basic tasks a smartphone does without noticeable lagging and stuttering. Considering the phone is near stock Android (only some light color changes and other tweaks) and has no carrier bloat, it just makes no sense. At first, I though maybe something was wrong, so I reset the phone, cleared the cache, and started fresh. Even after that, there was no improvement.I've used the LG G4, Moto X Pure Edition, and Nexus 5X. All of them identical hardware (Snapdragon 808, 3GB RAM) and yet all three do not have any of the performance problems the Robin has. Fortunately, that should mean it's a software issue. I'm hoping the upcoming Nougat update will help, but it's a toss up at this point.As of now, I cannot recommend this phone at all, even heavily discounted. On paper, the Nextbit Robin has so many advantages over something like the Moto G4 Play, but I would honestly recommend the Moto G4 Play over this.",2016年12月11日 在美国审核
Decent value at previous sale prices.,"Performance is decent for day-to-day usage.3GB of memory is decent for day-to-day use (web browsing and video watching).The phone does feel hot to the touch on heavier workloads, which is a slight inconvenience.The bootloader is unlockable, so enthusiasts have the option of extensive tweaks.Camera is so-so.While it works well enough in good lighting conditions, in automatic mode the camera occasionally takes a long time to focus and capture, or will take pictures where the background is in focus instead of the subject.The camera does have a manual option, which can provide much better results (with prerequisite good lighting conditions).Bluetooth reports a much higher battery drain in the last released version of the operating system.Wi-Fi is also occasionally problematic with connectivity drops.It is resolvable with the aforementioned tweaking capabilities, but the complaints are valid for less technical users.GPS lock is annoyingly slow; the time-to-first-fix can take 20 seconds in the best case, 100 seconds at the worst.This can result in incorrect location data on photos.It also very rarely misreports location by a fixed offset, making navigation apps useless.The Nextbit OS cloud storage solution has been shut down, but 32GB of onboard storage is more than enough for light usage and other cloud solutions are still viable.The design is simple.Maybe too simple.Coming from a more ergonomic phone (the original Moto X), the Robin is a little awkward for one-handed usage.It supposedly fails the bend test.It sits in my front pocket, and instead of bending it often slips out when I exit the car, occasionally onto the pavement.While a case will definitely prevent scuffing and scratches, a screen protector is sufficient and recommended.The reports of other people getting noticed by their phone are true; no less than six people have asked me what phone it was or comment on how neat it looks, even with the more subtle Midnight coloration and before the creators of the phone went on to announce and release ",2018年5月17日 在美国审核

Nice to have the actual Android platform with Google apps ...,"Big step up from the Fire phone. Nice to have the actual Android platform with Google apps again. Phone works seamlessly and the interface is simple. No bloatware. Doesn't feel very heavy. Material is very plastic, but I actually like not worrying about dropping and shattering the phone, and I'm not planning to put a case on it. It's nice to not have something so bulky. Phone does get warm, but it hasn't gotten hot to where it concerned me. Screeen size is perfect for me, 5.5 in is as big as I could even see myself going. Camera is OK, not great, but certainly better than what I am coming from using. Obviously storage will not be an issue. Speakers are loud and sound quality is nice. It's a can't miss at $160. The one legit drawback - battery life. It hasn't failed me yet, and I'm certain to keep it charged, but it does run down a bit quicker than what I would expect.7/9/17Have now had the phone for six months. Disappointed to learn that it will cease being updated at the beginning of next year. However, my original review is still the story - smooth operation, bad camera, it gets warm sometimes... what I've noticed is complaints about charging. Battery life is not good - however, if you will buy a good charger/cable, it will recharge very quickly. Bought a Blackweb setup from Walmart inexpensively, and was impressed at the recharge time.

I love this phone,"I was talking with someone about getting a new, mid range phone and I'm so glad this IT dude recommended me the Nextbit. I was going for the Nexus 5x and I'm sure I would've loved that too but the Nextbit was cheaper. Honestly for the price this is 7/5 stars. For me personally I just needed a phone that can do the basics (email, internet, news, some apps, reddit...) without slowing down. Sure it doesn't have the best camera, the best battery life, or even the fastest phone. But for $170 why are we even trying to make comparisons to $600 phones?

Just what I needed,"This phone is everything I could have hoped for... ha, keep in mind I've only had one phone before this, though (cheap one, too). The resolution of the screen is perfect, you don't really need a better one. The size of the phone itself doesn't allow for me to type comfortably with just one hand, but two works just fine, I don't mind. The picture and video capture quality of this phone is really good for the price (around 170 for me). It can run pretty much any game out there on the play store, so that shouldn't be a problem. The battery size is questionable, but not too big of an issue for me. I would recommend getting a case, though, as the phone itself is a bit fragile. You can go on YouTube and watch someone snap one in half with little effort, but thats probably not going to happen in day to day situations... If I had to guess. Also, you will probably have to download a few gigabytes worth of updates the second you unlock the phone. The charging cable is weird, but it fits in any USB port. The volume can get pretty loud (for a phone) and the front facing speakers are a nice addition. There is a fingerprint sensor, but it is only for making purchases online or something, I didn't bother looking into it.

Battery life is subpar, and the camera is not that great. Though thats NOT what this phone is for. This phone is great for making payments to android pay, gaming to a certain extent (this phone can run really hot) and has excellent speakers. I easily was able to install Android Nougat, and the experience is so far so good. Though the screen doesnt repel fingerprints very well, the back side of the phone will most likely leave the grease on your fingers on the phone.

Do not buy from DealFisher,"I have purchased the phone before and loved it but my neighbor's puppy ate it and had to buy another one. I purchased this one from DealFisher - a huge mistake. It was missing parts, the screen was broken, phone was scratched and dented, it also looked like it was tampered with (bottom of phone looked like someone tried to remove it). It would make sounds but the screen would not turn on. Bottom line - great phone but DealFisher should not be allowed to sell phones!",2018年4月16日 在美国审核
Notification light is pretty much pointless,"The phone has flaws:Notification light is pretty much pointless, on the bottom edge.Auto-rotate sometimes gets confused and stops rotating unless forced by an app.Fingerprint sensor on the power button is neat in someways (and it's super quick and responsive) but it means any time you want to just check the lockscreen, it tries to unlock and vibrates as it errors on the fingerprint read.Good phone for the price though, haven't needed the cloud storage yet, so no idea how well or useful that is.With google photos, not really sure how people are filling up 32GB of space with apps.",2016年9月19日 在美国审核

BUY THIS PHONE!,"I purchased this phone almost 3 months ago and love it! I am coming from a Galaxy Note 3 that was quitting on me after 3+ years of usage. I really like the size of the Nextbit. Going down on size from my previous phone I think this is the perfect size for a phone that easily fits in my pocket. In my opinion the camera is pretty awesome and I've taken some very nice photos with this phone. The front facing speakers work well and are pretty loud compared to other phones I've had. I use this phone a lot through out the day for work, taking calls, sending emails, and using GPS for navigation and I think the battery life is great for how much I use it. I will have to put it on the charger around 4-5pm in the car but compared to my Note 3 it was 12-1pm so I think the battery life is great. The cloud storage works great and I'm surprised more manufacturers haven't followed in there foot steps. I'm using the phone on AT&amp;T with no issues. So over all for $169!!! this phone is a great deal! (I paid $225) If you are contemplating purchasing BUY THIS PHONE!",2016年11月14日 在美国审核

It's a good size, and the shape is surprisingly comfortable to hold.<br>I would buy it again in a heartbeat.I got better reception on this phone than i did on my Samsung 6 edge plus.For the price point, this phone is a steal.Ok, a year later. I've used this phone on TMobile, FreedomPop, and my mom stuck her att sim in it when her iPhone died.It's fantastic. It's held up to abuse. The battery life never got worse. Which i cannot say about my Moto 3 plus I'm currently using on sprint.My only wish was that i could have brought it with me to the new carrier. But, I'm using it as a media device. The battery lasts 15 hours using it for music, podcasts,and the occasional video. Also, the layout is so simple a 4yo can figure it out easily.This is by far my favorite phone ever.

Screen problems but Nextbit/Razer honored warranty.,"Almost perfect so far !

The best part is the fingerprint sensor , genius! better than the one in my BLU, specially the placement on the on button.I like stuff that is unique (like myself) and the Robin is a unique device.Update: on march 17, the phone screen suddenly developed color lines across the screen and the screen is foggy, only 2 months after purchase, I haven't drooped and usually keep it in my purse. Will see if there is a warranty for it.Update April 6: Send it for Warranty replacement to Nexbit in SF 2 weeks ago, the guys have kept in touch with me thru e-mail which is nice.UPDATE: april 12: Just got my new Robin replacement from Nextbit/Razer, they included a charger, screen covers and case as a gift which is nice.

Great phone,"For $129 NEW - it's as good as it gets.(*Update)I've noticed today that the left side of the phone glass sits higher than the right side of the phone. Basically, the glass sticks out past the bezel on the left side and within/under the bezel on the right side.I'm not sure if the phone was damaged during shipping, as the box was about 20x to large for this item, or if it's a manufacturer issue? I'm going to returning the item for a replacement ASAP.Also, so there's no confusion; there's no way that the phone has been bent by me and caused the issue. I tried putting slight pressure on the side where the glass is higher to see if there was any give (there's none) and I don't put my phones in my back pocket as I've seen to many people bust glass this way - and it's just uncomfortable.. It's as if components under the glass are to large for the housing of the phone so that the glass doesn't fit in all the way. It's VERY minuscule - talking a MM difference, just enough for my fingernail to feel on each side of the device that the glass is higher on one side and bezel is on other. I'm just returning for a replacement because I don't want something to happen in a couple weeks and my glass break or something stupid like that. I'm sure you know how it is.If the next one I get has the same issues I'll just return it for a refund. I may do that with this return if they don't allow replacements to be mailed out first like Amazon does with the Prime devices. I'll see tomorrow during biz hours what they say.Sure, you could pay $120 on eBay for a used G4 and get a much better device due to the great Camera and Removable SD/Battery capabilities, but this phone is NEW and has everything else the G4 has (spec wise). Plus, you get WiFi tether and virtually no bloat without needing too root the phone.If You have less than $150 to spend on a phone and you're the type of person that needs it to be new, you won't be disappointed; unless you're just unrealistic with understanding quality phone values.If you can opt to spend a bit more money ($210-sh) I'd recommend you get the Zut Z2 over this device as it has Flagship Specs for a dirt cheap price. However, for $80 less than that you won't be mad about purchasing this.*Initial use takes a bit because of a dead battery and about 3-4 updates needed upon boot. Don't expect to open and go with this one.",2017年6月28日 在美国审核

Third time's NOT a charm.,"First things first - Terrible Quality Control, imo.Ordered this three times, and each had a different issue.First time the phone was slightly bent, and had discoloration/marks on the back.Second time the phone arrived with the battery completely discharged.Who knows how long it was stored this way - def not healthy for overall battery life.Add onto that buzzing/distortion from the speakers.Third, and final shot at this phone and everything is great for the first couple hours.Then the vibration motor developed an annoying buzz.Camera is pretty bad.With updates to the phone and camera software, it becomes alright, but the pictures/colors always seem off.My Nexus 5 pictures come out way more vibrant (not even using HDR).Speakers are pretty bad.Don't expect to have the volume up way too high without some buzzing/rattling from the speakers.If you can live with the speakers and cameras, andare lucky enough to get a good a unit without issues, you'll have a pretty good phone for the price (~$150).The specs at this price point are pretty amazing - it's why I kept going back hoping for a good unit.EDIT -- Razer has acquired Nextbit, and warranty info has changed.Warranties will only be fulfilled until July 2017.That's 6 months if you buy it now, the longer you wait the less time you're covered.With the issues I had with my units, and the fact that I'm looking for a budget phone to use for about a year, I'm glad I didn't stick around with a Robin!Maybe I'll look into it again if it drops sub $100 as a backup / project phone!",2017年1月28日 在美国审核
Amazing value - excellent performance.,"Besides the Pixel this is the only other Android device that appeals to me because: It never lags, the skin is subtle and by installing a launcher you can get a very similar experience to a Nexus device.The camera, display and performance far exceeds the Nexus 5x.Closed Beta for Nougat (android 7) is already out so in a short while the it will have the latest AndroidOS. Additionally, the bootloader is unlockable and you won't void your warranty flashing ROMs on it as the Nextbit team supports hacking.My battery life has been good usually getting all day life with moderate use.

It has no bloatware and runs almost stock android with a handy nextbit cloud assist apps. Its a steal for $170. The fingerprint scanner placement is pretty weird, but then it made perfect aesthetic sense to use that space of lock/unlock button as an added fingerprint scanner. It freed up space for dual stereo facing speakers, and the speakers are the best in business.It is completely made up of plastic, but it helps keep the weight and costs down.

At this price this is the BEST value on the market currently!

Knowledgeable Review you wanna know.,I've had my Robin for 24hrs and with my experiences with notable smartphone brands. I'd have to say Nextbit's Robin is the best external cloud storage smartphone in it's price range. Tip* For first time users. When beginning the initial factory startup. Go ahead and skip the wifi and account set up. I've experienced a update flaw when connecting to wifi for the first time. It's best to save those settings in till you get the OS functional and you can operate the phone's full features. I owe that knowledge to Amazon Tech Support. They were Very helpful. By all means the phone is all around exceptable. If you love Android but need that expandable cloud storage you see in Apple's iPhone. Nextbit's Robin is the best phone for you.,2017年10月10日 在美国审核

Just got this phone yesterday so this review is all about first impressions:,"Day two, and I love this phone. In my opinion - no offence to you folks that love your ""Flagship"" Android phones or are on the iPhone merry-go-round - paying $500 or more for a cell phone is the STUPIDEST thing ever. You know these things aren't difficult to break, right? I need a phone. I like the gadgets and toys it provides, but I don't really need them. I paid $159 for this phone. I can buy 5 of these for the price of your dumb iPhoneWhatever. The full retail of $299 is a fair price but at $159 it's a steal. This phone replaced my Moto X 2nd Gen. and I've been a Motorola phone user for three phones now (that's 6 years in people time).This phone is factory unlocked and your warranty is not void if you install a non-factory blob to it. This means I actually OWN this phone and can use it how I like. I will NEVER own another phone locked to a carrier or full of a crapload of stupid apps that some company makes me have. They tell you it's got 32GB then jam 12GB of junk on it that you can't remove unless you unlock the phone and void the warranty. Just stop buying phones from companies that do business that way and do us all a favor.The fingerprint scanner on the power button is pure genius and a bonus is quad-band meaning I can use it in Europe when we vacation there. 32GB of storage is huge, stereo speakers, 13MP camera, Quick Charge capable, what more can you want?More good:1. Love the shape and style. Square and flat is the new ""cool"" in cell phones in my opinion and this one is great looking. Slightly longer than my Moto X with the same screen size but thinner feeling because it's flat and the square edges make it way easier to keep a grip on.The nearly matching upper and lower bezels give the phone a visual balance that's appealing to the eye.The ""Mint"" color accents and visual effects are a nice change. I just couldn't see myself with a phone totally mint colored, but my wife loved it - I got the dark colored one - she can get her own :)2. 100GB of cloud storage instead of a SD card slot. Automatically backing everything up is a great idea. No effort required and impossible to lose.The Bad: The only things I have to complain about are:1. The ""desktop"" has no way to hide every installed icon. In comparison, the Motorola interface allowed me to remove the icon from the screens without uninstalling the app and instead access the app from the ""All Apps"" button. This phone has the All Apps button but it provides an alphabetical list of installed apps rather than usable access to an app. I have created various ""folders"" and stacked apps in them to get it down to only 3 screens worth of icons. I had like 7 screens full of junk before. Hmmm, maybe I need to delete a couple things, ya think? Maybe they'll fix this down the road.2. Occasionally I notice a slight hesitation in scrolling the screen like when on the 'net. I don't know if it's Chrome's fault or the phone's but I don't recall seeing this on my Moto X. It's not bad enough to be much of a bother.Re. comments from others: This is a new phone from a new startup. The first devices had a couple issues but it seems many of the bugs are worked out. I hope they can move the full retail price down to the $200 mark and improve the interface a little re. the app icons. As I just got the phone, I can't comment on the battery life, but I love that it supports quick-charging. I habitually charge my phones every night anyway so I doubt I'll care much about that.The only things I miss from my Moto are the active screen that gives you a glance at notifications and the clock without actually touching the phone, and the gesture actions - double twist opened the camera and a double ""hatchet chop"" turned on the light. These functions are probably patented by Motorola so I'm not hoping to get them back with this phone.Final thoughts: This is not a $700 flagship phone, but why do you need that anyway? Buy a cheap well-functioning unlocked phone like this one, switch to a cell carrier and plan that's affordable, and spend the dough on a great tablet instead.Your gaming and multi-media experience will be better and your money will go further. Even better; use the savings to take your spouse or best friend out for a wonderful evening instead. That will provide more enjoyment than any high-end phone will.",2017年1月21日 在美国审核

I had issues with the software but made it work.,"When I turned on the phone for the first time, I had to set it up and it started to download an update, once it finished the phone restarted but it freezed in the first screen, had to do a factory reset and start again. I had to do this for 3-4 times, I was upset and about to return the phone but the last factory reset worked and since then the phone has been working great. The phone speakers sounds kind of messy if I play music, but most of the time I use headphones so it doesn't matter too much to me. I loved that the Power button works also as a finger scanner, so you can unlock it easily. The camera is really good, but is not an iPhone or a samsung galaxy so don't ask for miracles, but at least is a lot better than my prevoius phone camera (htc one m7).UPDATE:When I restart or turn on the phone there's a little chance it gets stucked on the loading screen, when that happens I have to do a hard restart (vol down + power). Eventually android will load fine (it can load fine after the first try, but sometimes it takes 2-3 trys), the good thing is that I almost don't restart/turn off my phone.",2017年3月21日 在美国审核

My 2 weeks with Robin,"I bought this phone when my Nexus 6p came down with the never-ending bootloop flaw a week before we were heading out of town. I frantically looked for something with similar specs before leaving, and to my surprise found a very affordable alternative in the Nextbit Robin. And for the most part, it performed admirably on our trip with a few exceptions; however, Huawei was able to resolve my bootloop issue so I went back to the 6p.Perhaps it's a bit unfair to compare the 2 phones given their price points, but the reasons I went back to my Nexus are as follows:-It's faster and smoother. Despite similar specs, the Robin really lagged at times.-Speaking of lagging, the camera performance of the Robin was borderline abysmal. Again, the Robin sounded good on paper, but any shot that didn't stay still for about 5 seconds ended up blurry.Aside from the camera, I think the Robin is a fine phone, and you just can't beat the price for all the features you're getting. But I had to go back since I had a better alternative.",2017年1月17日 在美国审核

"Great phone for the sub-$200 price, despite some shortcomings.  Unbeatable value right now.  Especially for T-Mobile customers.","Extremely happy with this phone given the sub-$200 price tag.My LG G3 doesn't work on the newer T-Mobile extended network, so I was looking for a phone that has band 12, Volte and, preferably, wifi calling too.I wasn't yet ready to invest in another, expensive ""flagship"" phone, so I started looking at options (Axon 7, Honor 8, Moto X Pure).When I stumbled across the Robin at the $150 price point, I took the leap.Now, although my G3 struggles with GPS sometimes, it works well in every other sense (excellent camera, solid feel, split screen function, decent speaker).I would still use it but for the lack of Band 12.I've had the Robin for about a week now and here are my general impressions:SPEAKERSs:great.The sound is not necessarily robust, but for a phone, they are loud, clear and sound good with no crackling.They're better than my other phones' speakers.SIZE:It's slightly narrower than my G3 which makes it easier to hold and use it with one hand.It also feels a little heavier than the G3.I like how the G3 maximizes screen size relative to the total device size.Not so much with the Robin.BUILD QUALITY:Some say it is easily bendable (search YouTube) and the weakest phone on the market.It feels solid to me and even more so with a Tudia case on it.Perhaps it won't stand up to sitting with it in my back pocket, but that's only a very minor worry for me.Don't intentionally bend your phone and you should be fine.HEAT:Don't notice anything above what my G3 does.I don't game, but I have played extended videos and nothing is too uncomfortable.ACCESSORIES:Very limited case options and nothing, in my opinion, available to really handle drops well.Yes, the Robin doesn't come with a quick charger.Oh well.CAMERA:Nothing to be too excited about.No OIS, no laser focus.If camera is really important to you (or you main/only digital camera), you may want to reconsider.For the price I paid, I don't care so much.BUT I can see getting frustrated eventually if I'm constantly getting blurry shots of the kids.UI:Again, nothing to be thrilled about.But you can install your own launcher and be fine.STORAGE:Just 32 GB with no expandable storage.100 GB of cloud storage, but there is no easy way to access files online on the cloud if you lose/break you phone.I hear that is coming. We'll see.I don't like the lack of an SD card at all.If I switch phones, I want to take my docs/photos with me.FINGERPRINT SENSOR: first time I've had one and I'll never get another phone without one.It works most of the time, but I'm learning how to increase my success rate with it.Still, it's not perfect.Also, wish it allowed 6 (instead 5 fingers). Can't really compare the sensor to ones on other phones, but according to other reviewers, it seems to be one of the better sensors.NOTIFICATION LIGHT:It's on the bottom.Hard to notice, especially with a case on it.I use the No-Led app which I love for it's iconnotifications, despite some battery impact it has.BATTERY:Non-replaceable and small.Definitely on the shorter end of battery life right now.But it charges fast and I carry a power pack with me in my car.If you forget to charge it before going somewhere, you might find yourself quickly out of juice.Definitely needs to be improved in the next version.OVERALL:I really enjoy this phone.I like that it's slightly narrower than my G3, love the dual front speakers, Band 12/Volte/Wifi Calling for T-mobile (yes, all three work), and while I'm first function over form, the Robin is a good looking phone.The camera and battery life are, to me, the real shortcomings of the phone.But given the price, I can live with the shortcomings.

Very light phone if you are concerned about weight. Display is lovely. No app drawer in marshmallow is weird, but a launcher can fix that. Not sure about the cloud storage idea, as I haven't had to use it. The design of the phone looks nice but isn't very practical. The power button, also the fingerprint sensor, is flush with the side of the phone, making it harder to use. The phone material is so smooth (and the phone is so thin) that it is hard to pick up if you set it on a flat surface like a table, so you will need a case. Unfortunately there aren't many cases available.

On the off chance Razer would help, I contacted their hardware support explaining the situation. Their response was to contact Software support.My hope is there isn't a problem with the charging circuitry and a battery replacement will be all that's needed. Considering the current cost of the phone and the fact I haven't done any hardware repairs on phones before and the initial research I've done is indicating some mixed impressions on repair-ability.

great budget Android phone,very good phone. very novel backup feature came in handy after i performed a full reset. i had to buy a case to help soften the edges as holding it was a bit uncomfortable. very good picture quality. front speakers are adequately loud. fingerprint sensor is rather quick. the offset USB-C port is . a bit awkward to use in my phone dock &amp; i wish the headphone jack were on the bottom as well.,2017年2月5日 在美国审核

Love this phone,"I've had this phone about a month now, and I love it!It is by far one of the easiest phones I've ever used.It does not come preloaded with a bunch of games and apps I'll never use, and I can find everything I want in the Google Play Store.The features the phone does have are very efficient and functional.There's not really anything that I would think of as wasted space.I'm not much of a tech kind of person.I want to take it out of the box and be able to use it without a lot of fuss, so all these things were very important to me.I love the idea of the phone archiving things for me that I don't use much and never have to worry about running out of storage.The camera works great.I've taken some beautiful video at my kids' Christmas concerts, and my teenage son was quite impressed with the quality of the speakers when we were listening to the playback.All in all, I'd say this phone is an amazing deal.",2017年1月6日 在美国审核

Pretty &amp; Unique. Lacking innovation &amp; substance. And a charger.,"I have been coveting this phone for the past year-- waiting for my Note to explode or finally die so I could purchase. I finally did it for Christmas &amp; I have to say I'm not incredibly impressed. Maybe I built it up too much. Maybe I haven't had enough time with it. But dare I say, I kind of miss the functionality of my note.1) Widgets are in a separate screen that you have to pinch to access. I hate this. I think. I can't decide. I'm definitely not immediately loving this part though I guess I'm back &amp; forth because I can get over the minor inconvenience. BUT intuitively, when I add a calendar or task list widget or my bank account or music player-- I do so because I don't want to have to open the app. I am swiping to see them in the mix of my other apps. Having to pinch to open an entire other area in the phone just to get them negates, in my opinion, the seamless ease of what the widget purpose is. BUT, it is just a pinch, so maybe once I get used to it I won't be so annoyed.2) The fingerprint sensor on the button is cool. But it's reliability is iffy. I'd say it works 80% of the time, despite having all angles and sides and points of finger put in when I set it up. Sometimes it literally just doesn't work.3) Love the boxy shape-- but I almost wish it were a little bigger. This is likely because I love huge phones and I was used to the size of my note. It's definitely comparable, but it is smaller for sure.4) I miss the buttons on the bottom of the phone that took me back or opened all my apps. These appear on the screen and that works too and is more like lower end android phone operating systems. There are some apps and functions though when they just don't appear and I have to turn my screen off just to get out of an app. This is annoying.5) Speaking of apps. When the buttons do appear on the bottom of the screen and I can open all my active apps-- I have to swipe them one by one to close. I may just not have found it yet-- but I miss having a bulk close.6) Accessories-- there are few. Obviously. But the one I bought was a clear, not manufacturer, case I found on Amazon. It's ok. I would have liked the Nextbit one but they wanted over $35 for it. Which, I just couldn't justify. Because...7) I had to buy a charger base that cost $35. This should be more featured in their listing. like: ""DOES NOT INCLUDE CHARGER"" so that people know, without having to search through reviews or the internet, whether or not the box does in fact come with a charger. It does not. It comes with the USB cord. And you could function and charge fine with just that (plug it into your computer, plug it into your old base) but-- this entire logic/thought process annoys me. And I imagine, like me, most people just pay the extra money to get the matching complete charger. Which-- is the point of selling it separate right? For the price of this phone and what it is-- just include the charger. I very seriously can't imagine that including the charger vs not including the charger was going to break your margin. Which makes me, as a customer who really really supported this phone, the idea and bought it-- feel kind of duped in the end. It doesn't cost $150 dollars. It ends up costing closer to $200 after a case and charger are purchased. Still not a bad deal, but give your customers some credit. We can math.The bottom line: I like it. But not as much as I thought I would. Maybe it will grow on me. It is pretty. And unique. Which is really why I bought it-- but I wish there was more substance behind it.",2016年12月30日 在美国审核

Small company = Great customer Service,"This might be long review but I hope it will help you. I bought the Nextbit Robin on Saturday, May 11. It was on sale for $299(great deal). It got here on Monday and was working great. After an hour or so, I clicked the button to update the robin to 6.0.1(it is a big update and make sure you do it). It was going great but it was taking hours. I contacted Nextbit support that night and they said I was stuck in a boot loop. They tried a couple different ways to get me out of a boot loop, but nothing would work. They gladly sent me a RMA label. I just sent it back and they are sending me a new Robin. There customer support was great. It was like when you walk into an apple store, but you're online. I can't really speak of the performance because I only had it operating correctly for an hour, but a snapdragon 808 and 3gigs of ram should handle almost every task. If you are worried about buying a phone from a small start up company--DON'T BE. Nextbit being a small company actually makes it a more personal experience compared to a big company like Samsung. One last thing, don't be afraid to buy this phone because of the problem I experienced. All phones can experience this not just Robin's. I will add more to the review once I get a new Robin. Hope this helped!#NextNow",2016年5月14日 在美国审核

"Can't be beat for $200, but there are drawbacks","The Nextbit Robin is by far the most performant phone you can get brand new for the price, and the cloud storage for apps is interesting, if gimmicky. This review is for the Midnight model, though my wife owns the Mint one.The Specs: $200 buys you a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC, 3GB RAM, a 5.2"" 1080p LCD covered by Gorilla Glass 4, 13MP/5MP cameras, front facing stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor, and - unusually for unlocked phones in this price range - NFC, for using Android Pay.The Pros:SPECS. The specs above outperform every other phone in this price range, at least thanks to the Snapdragon 808. While most phones in this price range generally use octa-core Cortex-A53 parts - a core designed for efficiency over performance (for example, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 found in the Honor 5X or the MediaTek MT6753T found in the Blu Vivo 5R) - the Robin opts for a hexa-core Cortex-A72/A53 part, which uses four efficient A53 cores and two powerful A72 cores. It's a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but the point is that on paper, the Nextbit Robin is a better performer than anything else in its class.REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE. During day-to-day use, the phone does indeed perform very smoothly and can handle even gaming just fine.FINGERPRINT SENSOR. The fingerprint sensor is a nice thing to have, and since this phone runs Android 6.0 out of the box, it uses the Android fingerprint sensor API to allow simple authentication for apps like Android Pay and LastPass. Being side mounted thanks to doubling as the power button is a nice touch too, since it allows simple access while you're holding the phone without cluttering up the front or back of the phone.CAMERAS. The cameras can both take some decent shots - about what you'd expect from a phone in this price range, though, so temper your expectations.ANDROID SKIN. The skinning of Android is fairly light, opting to change the visual style more than seriously modify anything. This even means you have a Nexus/Pixel style System UI tuner if you hold down the Settings gear above the Quick Settings panel!NEXTBIT CLOUD STORAGE. The cloud storage works as advertised - all of your apps come back from cloud storage as though you never had them uninstalled in the first place.QUICK CHARGE. Quick Charge 2.0 helps alleviate some of the battery life woes (see below).DESIGN. This will be polarizing, but I think the Midnight Robin is gorgeous and the Mint Robin is adorable. The fact that it's flat on all sides seems like it would make it a hard phone to hold, but it's really nice in the hands.The Cons:BATTERY LIFE. This is an ""All day only with light use"" smartphone. There's really no sugar coating it. Even out of the box, battery life is pretty poor. Screen on time is only about 2 to 3 hours in my experience.FINGERPRINT SENSOR. It's fairly fast, but probably because of its small size, it's really sensitive to how you put your finger on it. If your finger is angled differently than it expects, it has a tendency to reject it.HEAT. The Snapdragon 808 is not a great chip. It gets very hot and has to switch to its more efficient cores fairly often. This means that the Robin can get uncomfortably hot if you're doing anything very taxing on the processor.BUTTONS. The volume buttons on the left side are hard to pick out on the side without a case. While I kind of like it now, the recessed power button/fingerprint sensor on the right side is easily confused with the also recessed SIM tray that sits below the power button.SPEAKERS. While a lot better than they were with the factory software, they still distort badly on high volumes. HTC BoomSound these ain't.CLOUD STORAGE. The Robin provides virtually no control over the cloud storage at all. Your apps get backed up, your photos (but not videos!) get backed up. You can't uninstall backed up apps until they're restored, either.NEXTBIT HOME. Like launchers on most Chinese phones, all apps are dumped onto your home screen. There is an app drawer, but it's fairly unintuitive to use. Better to dump it for something like Nova or Google Now Launcher.NO SD SLOT OR REMOVABLE BATTERY. The expandable storage on the Robin is limited to cloud storage, which is kind of depressing. Applying Nextbit's smart storage features to local storage would be outstanding. Also, carrying around spare batteries would help alleviate the Robin's battery life woes, but this battery is not removable.Overall, the Robin is a competent first attempt from Nextbit Systems. It's a beautifully designed, deceptively simple phone that ticks a lot of good boxes without too many bad. That all said, the cloud storage... is pretty gimmicky, and the mediocre battery life is frustrating. But it provides a nice glimpse into what we can look forward to from Nextbit.",2016年11月4日 在美国审核

Get this phone.,I have been waiting on the Nextbit Robin since its Kick Starter campaign. When I saw that Amazon was offering it at the pricethat early adopters on Kick Starter got I had to pull the plug and buy one. I love this phone. It feels great in the hand. It is very lightin weight. The screen resolution and brightness is fantastic even in bright outdoor light. I read a lot about the speakers being poorin sound quality but believe me they are not. I find that I have really turn them down more often than not and the clarity of the sound isspot on. Both the front and back cameras do a fantastic job of capturing images for both photos and movies. Robin is a pure Androiddevice in that it doesn't come with all the bloatware that comes with most other phones. It will get updates from Android at the sametime they roll out to Google's own smart phones so you don't have to wait months for an update.My only complaint with this phone (as with most phones today) is battery life which I would put at marginal. I tend to usemy phone for streaming videos and I know that is part of the reason why the battery doesn't last very long. I can stream about 31 1/2 hour movies before I have to recharge the battery. The good thing is that it comes with USB C with quick charge and I cancharge the phone back to full in a couple of hours.I HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone looking to buy a newphone.,2016年5月10日 在美国审核

It's not as bright as some other screens but it's very crisp and good contrast.I was not a huge fan of the skin over Android but luckily it's Android and you can change that. Using the Google now launcher works perfectly.The phone is asking for $129. Would definitely buy it again. The speakers are clear but the ZTE axon 7 much louder.The battery does die quick but charges from 30 percent to fill in 35 min. The style is different and it stands out.

Junk,"Update: November 2017The makers are no longer supporting the phone so no new updates, security patches or fixes. In January they said they would support it for a year, that was a lie.There is also some issue with the phone during down while still showing 50% battery life. It shuts down, plug it in for a few seconds, turn it back on and it will last for awhile then do it all over again around 30% and again at 12%.Wish I'd never bought this piece of crap.Original:A friend talked me into this phone. He bought it in the original Kickstarter campaign and had been reasonably happy with it after the initial bugs were fixed.What I like: fingerprint scanner works great and is super easy since I'm forced to have a lock on my phone for work. love stock Android, but still waiting on the nougat update. Not sure how long I'll have to wait for that. The size is nice but a bit on the small side as I went from a nexus 6 to this. Thin, flat, basic, nothing overly special or flashy which is just fine.The ""I can live with it"": The overall look is nice but the fit and finish could be better. There's an odd bulge on the back cover, almost as if they made it a millimeter to thin to fit the components properly. Where the top and bottom joins the body is a bit wonky too. It heats up real quick and easy. The screen is alright, decent looking, not magnificent.What I don't like: keep in mind I had a nexus 6, awesome phone, far superior to this one in every way. The auto dim feature on the screen is absolute crap. I had to shut it off because I was constantly being blinded. The screen brightness is either enough, or blinding.The speakers are ok at best. Turn it up too loud and you get distortion and clipping.The camera is also mediocre at best. The Nexus took amazing photos and video. This one always seems blurry, even when propping the phone on a surface. It doesn't seem to have any stabilization, not good in lower light, videos are unclear if there's a lot of movement, and sound quality is crap if what you're recording was too loud. I recorded a few songs at a Disturbed concert with the Nexus and they were clear, decent sound. The Robin all you hear is awful distorted noise. You can barely identify the song.Overall it is what it is, a cheap stock Android phone with no bells or whistles. YouTube Netflix and the like are decent, speakers are ok at a moderate volume.If you plan on using it for decent photos/video, but a Samsung or something else.",2016年10月10日 在美国审核

Regret purchasing these phones,"My husband and I bought two of these Nextbit Robins less than one year ago. Actually, we bought them in February of this year, which means that we've had them for 8 months. While I'd like to write a positive review, the truth is that both of our phones are malfunctioning and we are now looking to purchase two new phones. The issue is the battery. About 70% of the time our phones charge up and act as they should. However, the other 30% of the time the phones do not take a charge and do not turn on at all.

Very capably unlocked smart phone for the price.,"Decent Android phone for the roughly 300 dollar price.I have purchased a number of Android cell phones over the years.I have a nanodegree in Android Application Development and I've done some customization to my phones in the past.I currently buy almost exclusively Nexus line phones for the support and clean Android interface provided by Google directly.That being said, I have been intrigued with the Nextbit Robin for sometime, ever since I first read about it in its Kickstarter campaign.I even backed it briefly until I felt it was an unnecessary purchase.However I'm very happy to see it being as much of a success as possible.I feel choice for the consumer is a very good thing.I finally purchase a Robin for my wife a couple months ago when the phone went on sale here at Amazon.I absolutely love the design of the device, the feel of it in your hand, the presentation when opening the box, and the uniqueness of it all.However, there were some minor issues from day one and one major issue.The major issue we had with the phone was the speaker audio.It was so loud it would distort the sound and was terrible.The volume went from ""0 to 8"" and then up from there.That has since, mostly, been fixed by a firmware update last month, but it made using the speakerphone or listening to music unbearable, a feature that should not be overlooked in today's modern smart phone.Other than that, minor issues were slight changes to the UI that I found worse than stock Android, the stock apps had less features than Nexus devices (such as no call-blocking in the phone app).The company itself is very easy to communicate with and more than willing to try and make things right.I ordered a couple covers for the phone and was sent the wrong color for one of them.They sent the right color with little fuss and made it easy for me.They have a good support forum and engage with the users directly to try and solve problems and increase the value of the phone.I since returned my Robin, but my wife kept hers.She still has some issues every now and then with the phone, but I think the next round, we'll stick with Nexus phones again.I went back to my Nexus 5X because from a hardware point, it was almost identical to the Robin, and from a software point, much nicer.For the price though, at least during the sale, it is a very capable unlocked smartphone.",2016年6月27日 在美国审核

I'm not a flashy person or anything, so the phone often gets compliments leaving me to think what about me lol? I have an iPhone and an apple watch, yet this phone has become my daily driver (with a pebble time), i would have never thought that when i bought the phone. The phone has lots of little touches from the software to the look that make it feel unique and made with love.My ONE DISLIKE is that there is no app drawer and yes i know Google launcher, but I'm a purest and hate installing extra stuff that drains even a sliver of battery.

"not worth it, seriously. read on...","i've had the robin for over a year now and have switched over to a google pixel after having the robin for about 3 months. i bought 2 of them for me and my bf at $400 each here on amazon. i was one of those people that saw it on kickstarter but wasn't sure if it was a hopeful prototype or an actually viable commercial product. it's the former.from the start, the phone ran pretty hot and lagged throughout the interface. less than 3 months into owning the phone, both of us contended that the robin is just way too laggy and undependable for daily use. the GPS offsets often, making navigation a pain as it would see our location one or two streets off to the side of where we actually were driving (yes, both of our phones had the same problem). restarting did not help. it would randomly work, but then randomly check out a few days later for an unknown period of time.battery life is absolutely atrocious on this phone. as a diehard sony fan (from ericssons to the current xperias), i'm not super stringent on battery life as sony phones have never been known to last very long on a charge. my last phone before the robin was the xperia z3, and the robin literally blew every phone i've owned out of the water in terms of battery life inadequacy. on 25% brightness setting, you can expect to watch videos for exactly 45 minutes to an hour before the phone warns you that it's low on battery. the best part is that after the most recent update, it now randomly drops from 15-40% battery to 0% and shuts off instantly. imagine trying to call your loved one in an emergency or just telling them you'll be coming home late, or even returning a call from your boss only to have your phone die unexpectedly. yeah, super convenient.ALSO OF NOTE: while researching for the battery problem, i've noticed every single google link to the nextbit community forums now link to a notice that they have been bought out or is now partnered with razer. very helpful. looks like the humble kickstarter nextbit team just took the money and ran, leaving original project backers and current device holders holding the purse strings, after never providing any meaningful quality-of-life to the consumer. i'd be VERY wary of purchasing or investing in anything that the nextbit developers come up with in the future.i very, very rarely leave negative reviews on amazon (or any at all in the 10+ years i've been a customer), as evidenced by my review history. seriously, don't buy this brick even at $150. i wouldn't even pay $50 for the amount of frustration and hassle it brings.",2017年5月17日 在美国审核

I really wanted to like this phone,"I really wanted to like this phone, I really did. I gave it a fair shot, but I ultimately sold it for the One Plus 3. I bought a blue one for my wife and a midnight color for myself. My wife is keeping hers so far. Here are my reasons for selling it:1. I just bought a 2016 Honda Accord with Android Auto. This phone never recognized with device. I changed everything: device (my wife's), flashed CyanogenMod, bought official type-C cable from Google play store, removed AA from battery optimization, and anything else I could remotely find online. Could never get it to even show any sign of connection. I finally resorted to Bluetooth, which leads me to...2. I rely heavily on bluetooth. I have 2 BT headphones, OBD2 adapters for 2 cars, 3 lost items trackers, smartwatches, external speakers, etc. The phone fails to connect ~40% of the time to my car, which is unacceptable, often dropping several minutes into the drive. It says it's connected, but audio comes from Robin speakers, not car. I can control the audio( FF, RW, Play/Pause) with car, but no audio through car. I have to disconnect and reconnect a random number of times to get it to keep a connection, anywhere from 2-10 times. It will most times send audio through for a few milliseconds before going back to the Robin speakers. While doing this process, the speakers on the Robin increase in volume immediately after the car BT disconnect. This has happened with headphones and speakers, but not as frequently. In addition to this clear annoyance, when I finally got it to hold a connection, it would sometimes bounce the audio b/t Left and Right speakers. I listen mostly to podcasts so I know it's not in any music.3. While trying to solve problem 1 listed above, I flashed every custom rom I could find in an attempt to get Android Auto to work. I noticed that few existed and all I could find were based on CyanogenMod. A bug existed at the time in every rom I tested: the phone would reboot immediately after hitting the call button.4. The fingerprint sensor failed way too often. It is my opinion that the failures are due mostly to the fact that the sensor is on the side of the phone vs the back or front of the device. It's a very skinny sensor and doesn't have the surface area of the front or back sensors. I ""taught"" the phone the same finger as 4 different fingers, systematically segmenting my finger into 4 rows for each of them. The One Plus 3 is much better at recognizing my fingers.5. The camera is still too slow, even after the update, and the picture quality is disappointing. It is slow to focus and I still miss many shots of my fast-moving small children. I delete more blurry shots than I ever keep.6. The front-facing speakers did not produce the sound quality or volume that I expected for the amount of volume that they add to the phone.7. The proximity sensor often failed to turn off the screen while on a call, leading me to hangup or go off into random apps.",2016年7月17日 在美国审核

I Love This Thing,"I had given up writing reviews for Amazon right after I received a non-polite invitation to do so by some fellows in one of those countries over there for having the temerity to insinuate that their sucky product did, in fact, suck. That and my extreme disappointment at having been passed over for the Amazon In-House fake review Vine Program.However, I am once again available for dancing and singing about the Nextbit Robin. It's great. Especially at the price I paid, which wasn't much. I realize the raison d'être of this phone is the cloud storage thing, but seeing that 32 GB was plenty big enough for what amounts to a burner phone, I promptly loaded Nova Launcher and set it up as a ""Normal"" android device (See photo). The screen is a bit washed out and hard to use outdoors in sunlight, but as I live in Cloudyville, it's not a problem. The battery life is less than what should be considered acceptable. I am getting about three and one-half hours of screen on time during moderate use (Web surfing, texting, e-mail and a voice call or two) and it lasts me all day. A heavy user would need to recharge it before the end of the day. I also own and operate a Nexus 5x which has a similar processor and one less GB of RAM and the Robin seems snappier. It is running a version (Robin's Own) of Android 6.01 and an upgrade to 7.0 Nougat is promised.I intend to use this phone solely as a modem for tethering, with occasional ""smart phone"" use. I have a car full of kids usually and a cellular WiFi connection and earphones for all hands keeps the noise and fighting to a minimum. For this purpose (with it plugged into a car or with an external battery pack) it kicks butt. Whoever put the t-mobile bands in this thing gave them super sauce. I'm in a Band 12 area and I get fast speeds up and down.So buy it. And thanks to the guy who didn't use it and returned it in mint condition so I could pay less than the prevailing rate, which is still so much of a deal I may buy another.",2016年10月7日 在美国审核
Trading in iPhone for Robin...best decision.,** Update: unfortunately I have to take a star off because a crack appeared on my replacement phone...I really love this phone so it's really frustrating that I've now had cracks appear out of nowhere on TWO phones. **I moved from an iPhone 4S to the Nextbit Robin.I was hesitant because I am so used to iPhone...I actually bought a Samsung Galaxy years ago but had to return it because I hated how different Android was to IOS.The design of the Robin really struck a cord with me so I decided to give it a shot.I fell in love as soon as I held the phone in my hand.It was actually a really easy transition to Android this time...I love the way everything is set up.It feels great in hand - really solid.I was one of those people who was always deleting things off my iPhone trying to make room since I was always getting the full storage notifications...really glad I won't have to deal with that anymore.The Nextbit community is great and support is there to help.After a week of having my phone I had a hairline crack appear on the back.I reached out to support and right away they were working with me to work out a replacement.I got a replacement and have had that one for 2-3 weeks now and have not had the crack issue re-surface.If you're thinking about moving from iPhone to Robin...I say do it!I haven't regretted it at all!,2016年6月19日 在美国审核
This Little Robin Didn't Fly......,"The phone is OK if you want to make phone calls as long as you can maintain service. In comparing it to other phones that is in our household it performed poorly in acquiring and maintaining service. In retesting though is it would show that is was getting full service of something but it would not make calls, send text or access the internet.The 13mp camera is absolutely terrible. I compared it to the camera on an iPhone 6, Nexus 6, Honor 8, and an LG G3 the Robin performed terrible in comparison to all of them. The pictures were focused terrible and the picture quality was well below acceptable for a 13mp camera. The app drawer button was more of a frustration than anything. Once you accessed it then you had to pick the category you wanted to use to gain access to your apps, just open the app drawer..The finger scanner is located in a great place and performs fast and accurate. That was really the only thing I enjoyed about the Nextbit Robin. Oh and the neat storage aspect really wasn't a pro to me as I back up all my goodies to Google and I was concerned that if Nextbit doesn't work out would all my stuff still be available. So in closing if your just needing a inexpensive phone that has a neat finger scanner here is the phone for you, but if you want to have a phone with functional operations and makes you all happy on the inside keep looking.",2017年1月23日 在美国审核
Fantastic Sub-Flagship Smartphone,"I would like to note first that this is not a Flagship device, but for the class of phone that this falls in it is perfect!. The big selling point for this is the 100GB of instant cloud storage for media and app (which is unique to this device). The 32GB of on board storage is plenty for most users and having the cloud backup makes it a bit more than just having 32GB. It is very snappy and in my use of the device is was smooth with no stuttering or slow downs. It works great with basic games, but I don't think that this for someone who enjoys playing any graphics intensive games. My favorite feature is the look! It is different from any other device that I have owned and feels extremely premium and durable.

I've found this most frustrating when trying to reset a progress bar to 0 in streaming applications like youtube or music (one s,"It's a neat looking phone, but has issues with build quality. The positive aspects of this phone are self-evident (pretty screen, alternative manufacturer, eye-catching design, fast/jaggy-free UI, power button/fingerprint integration), so this review will mostly focus on the phone's downfalls. The touch screen does not react to touches on left and right edges of screen which makes it difficult to use some applications; I've found this most frustrating when trying to reset a progress bar to 0 in streaming applications like youtube or music (one simply can't reset the progress bar without rotating the screen to landscape). Speakers crackle when the slightest bit of bass is present in a song and volume seems to be very loud even on the lowest setting. The phones back plastic is prone to pressure cracks even from the slightest drops. This problem isn't helped by the fact that the phone feels a bit awkward in the hand and is quite slippery. I'm coming from the Nexus 5 so I suppose I was a bit spoiled with an ergonomically pleasing design. With the standard camera app you cannot use the volume buttons to take photos. It also has compatibility issues with using Google Photos as the preferred gallery app; when launching Photos from the camera you cannot scroll through multiple photos, only the most recent photo is displayed. I love the power button/fingerprint integration, but can't stand the inset power button. It makes it very hard to find the power button in the dark.",2016年5月27日 在美国审核

The Nextbit company is very considerate, it offers update of the operating system up to Android 7.1.1.And when you have bought one, the necessary thing you need to do is find a place with WIFI to update the system(about 1 hour).4.

Unique item with high specs for cheap,"I've had this for a few months now, and I do love this phone. All of the positives are all over the reviews. But the camera surprised the heck out of me for sure. The problem is this, the build quality. Since the phone isn't all glass on front the bezels take a big amount of the real estate. If all glass on front this could've been a 5.5 display instead of 5.2. plastic body means it'll scratch easy so get a case or a skin for sure. I once lost all my bars on the phone and since this thing is all plastic (build is sacrificed for internals) if this bends enough in your pocket you the SIM slot may come out of lock and you'll have to push this in. Mechanic here so this thing is getting abused 10/6.New version of Android still promised and with them being purchased by Razer I'm positive they'll deliver. But this phone is the king of cheap phones instead of a POS lg from MetroPCS or Cricket you can have this power house. The camera isn't as good as an iPhone but there's no phone I've ever had under 400 bucks with this good of a camera.I've gone threw 6 phones in two years but with the performance of this thing with the front facing speakers which are perfect for watching videos in bed I think I'll keep this for a while. Depending on durability will be the factor. Ps since this is a plastic phone and not a metal one it's not as brital so won't destroy from drops easy. Just don't bend it.",2017年3月7日 在美国审核

The best phone I ever had,"The best phone I ever had....for 2 weeks. Loved everything about this phone, then one day it simply died and never turned back on again.",2017年7月3日 在美国审核
"Not a top-tier phone, but still great for what you pay.","I've had this phone for about 2 months now so I think it's time to review it.Cons: the battery time isn't great. When using actively it will go from a full charge to dead in probably six to eight hours. Now I have headphones that when actively using them died and 30 minutes but 60 hours is a bit too short I shouldn't need to charge my phone halfway through the day.My headphone Port doesn't work correctly. If I plug earbuds in, and it only seems to happen for earbuds for some reason, I get a lot of static and the static increases whenever I use an app connected to the internet or I have a lot of white on my screen leading me to believe it's interference from other signals in the phone and the headphone Port is just shielded poorly. I've read online other people have the similar issue.The next bit Robin launcher that comes installed on the phone by default maybe the worst Android Launcher I've ever used in my life. It doesn't support a traditional app drawer so you either have to have all your apps on the home screen like an iPhone or you have to go through your settings to pull up your apps. It also has no widget support which just blows me away. I installed Nova Launcher within a few hours of using this phone.I haven't really use the cloud storage at all I can't really find a use for it I don't feel my phone to Max usually and if I do it's only because I'm actively using everything on the phone so the cloud storage hasn't really packed anything up for me yet. And of course as others have pointed out the amount of time it would take to go and redownload your app from the cloud is about comprable to the amount of time it would take to just reinstall it from the App Store so it's really not a big deal in that Department. I can see it being a useful feature for people who take a lot of photos and then find themselves deleting their photos on a regular basis and then regretting having done so because now you could always get them back but that's a really niche market for that feature.I understand that this phone uses a newer version of USB but having a charging port that is totally incompatible with any USB cord I or anyone I know owns is a little bit of a pain I have to carry my cord everywhere I go because if I need to charge my phone ( remember the battery time) I can pretty much guarantee I will not have a compatible charger where I'm going. Additionally the wire it comes with is this full at semi-rigid wire rather than the standard shape. I understand it's most likely stronger and less prone to fraying and ripping like regular wires do however the fabric mesh wires solve this problem just as well and don't calls all the issues that this flat wire causes. Due to its shape it tends to coil up on itself very easily, making it hard to extend it any distance.The fingerprint scanner makes this weird vibrate whenever it reads your fingerprint which is similar to the vibrate that other phones would create to tell you that it was unable to read your fingerprint. It means that if you're like me and you come from let's say a Samsung phone where to use the fingerprint unlock and vibrated to let you know the fingerprint was wrong you think you put your fingerprint in wrong every single time you want lock your phone. Additionally the fingerprint scanner on this phone is not very good. My last phone was a Galaxy Note 5 and the fingerprint scanner on that was very good and I used as my standard lock. However the fingerprint scanner on this new phone, although in a more convenient location, will not read your fingerprint if there is even the slightest amount of moisture on it. If your hands have even the tiniest bit of perspiration on them the fingerprint scanner will not read your fingerprint. And if you put your fingerprint in wrong too many times it locks your phone and doesn't even give you the option to put in your password before just locking you out. Also once you're locked out it doesn't tell you for how long you just have to wait this undisclosed amount of time until it decides to let you back in. The first time it locks you out it only locks you out for about 30 seconds so it's not a big deal but I know most phones will lock you out for longer and longer periods for repeat attempts to unlock the phone. I could only imagine someone's K2 getting ahold of their phone attempting to open it 20 times in a row getting it locked for 6 hours and the parent picking up their phone and having no way to know how long it's going to be locked for.Pros: the first pro I have to mention is that the speakers are very loud. Other people that complain about the sound quality in the speakers and I can't really say that they're better than what I'm used to from a cell phone but it's a cell phone and the speakers are not going to have a very good sound quality no matter what you do. However assuming your Source material is loud enough these speakers can get very very loud.The main benefit of the phone is honestly its price point. It does not perform as well as the art earphones you're not going to get this phone and find that it's a one-to-one replacement for your Galaxy 7 or something. It noticeably lags on more processor-intensive games and apps and I've also noticed the overall phone is getting a bit of slow down that comes naturally with any phone you purchase but I am noticing it faster than I did with my previous Samsung phone. However I bought this phone for $185 and I have purchased sub $200 phones before and they are nothing like this. I seem to have a lot more negative than positive but that's because when you get rid of the negatives and the special features which are honestly not that useful you get just a pretty basic serviceable smartphone but you get one for a ridiculously low price tag. I bought the Moto G back when it came out and I've had the HTC Desire shortly after it was a fairly new phone. Both of these were budget phones and both of them were almost unusable the HTC Desire could not hold a battery charge for more than 30 minutes if I was using any apps whatsoever and it would crash with anything more intensive than just a basic web browser. In fact I couldn't even support Chrome and I had to use Opera. The Moto G while better was not a lot better it could barely run anything it slow down within days of me purchasing it it had a battery time lower than this phone and just overall wasn't as good. I bought this phone because I drop my Note 5 on the floor and broke it and I desperately needed a phone fast but I didn't want to Shell out $125 for a bottom to your phone which was going to be non usable within 6 months. So I found this phone and you know what for $185 you get a pretty damn good phone it's not going to stand side-by-side to an 800 $900 phone but it's worth a lot more than the 185 they're asking for. It can run modern games and apps they slow down from time to time and they call the noticeable battery drain but they run they open they're playable.All the battery time maybe low the phone does charge very fast if you use the charging cable provided with it and use a decent amp when plugging it into the wall it will go from zero to charged in one to two hours. The periodic Phillips you have to do throughout the day become not as much of a deal when you can plug it in for 20 minutes and bring your phone from 75 to 100.The camera is very good it's a higher megapixel camera and then the Google pixel which has been marketed heavily on its camera so there's that.The totally Square screen may not seem like a bonus upfront but when you're shopping for screen protectors it is very annoying to normally have to only use screen protectors designed for a specific type of phone I paid $40 for a screen protector designed to fit on my Galaxy Note 5 I bought a set of two screen protectors for this phone for like $12 because they're rectangles and anyone can make thatOverview : this review may have seemed quite negative and you might be wondering why I gave this phone a four out of five stars but honestly all of the cons or nitpicks with the exception of the headphone Port just being broken nothing else about the phone is anything different than what was promised. It's a mid to mid-high tier phone at the price point of a low tier phone.I'm sure the cloud storage is useful to someone it hasn't been useful to me yet but I'm perhaps not the type of person that that's for however the 100 gigs of just cloud storage that you're allowed to use for whatever you'd like that's pretty nice and it definitely is something that I'm going to plan on using for backing up music when my phone starts filling up and things like that. If you have the money to spare and you really want a talk to your phone you want something that's not going to lag on you you want something that is going to have half of the battery left at the end of your day you want something that is going to run every new app and every new game when they come out then this probably isn't your phone. Pay the extra price point and get a Galaxy phone or one of the newer iPhones. But if you need a phone and you want smartphone that's going to work like a smartphone and you don't have $900 of disposable income I can't think of a better option than this phone. This phone outperforms many phones that are hundreds of dollars more expensive than it. So that's my overall review. It's not a talk to your phone but it's not trying to be and for what it does succeed at doing you're getting a really good price.",2017年2月14日 在美国审核

I was not impressed by this phone at all.I have an LG phone in the same price range and the Robin doesn't even come close.Here's why:The setup took over an hour right out of the box due to multiple software updates required.Not really a bad thing, it just took a lot longer than I was expecting.The screen is very limited in its ability to customize; the app archive drawer can't be removed and takes up one position all the time, there is a Google search bar that also can't be removed or even moved and takes up the whole top bar on every one of the home screens.The only options for apps when you long press is to uninstall or see info.No option to remove from the home screen without uninstalling.Cannot create an empty homepage, must have at least one app on each page, thus the least you could have on any homepage would be the Google search bar, the app archive drawer button and one app, which is pretty busy for an empty homepage...lastly, I was expecting the screen to be crystal clear at 400+ PPI but I can clearly see granularity especially in the light or white portions.I would not recommend this phone.",2017年2月3日 在美国审核

The phone is just the right size and feels great in the hands,"Upon receiving the phone I was highly impressed with the packaging and the design of the phone itself. I have been using the phone for a few days now and I must say the phone is very quick and snappy. The sound from the speakers is very crisp and clear as well. The phone is just the right size and feels great in the hands. I must say the OS design and layout definitely had a lot of thought and design put in them. The cameras are clear as crisp as well and the fingerprint scanner is very quick to unlock the phone.<br>However with the good does also come the bad. I have been using the phone for about 4-5 days now and have noticed the phone does get quite warm quite quick when streaming video or playing games. I removed the phone from the case to clean it and upon removing from the case I noticed some marks on the back of the phone which look like scratches which would be odd as the phone has been in a case since the day it was purchased. Upon looking into this further I notice a bulge on the back of the phone around where the said marks are appearing. I am not sure if this a design flaw or from the phone getting to hot. I will be reaching out to Nextbit support to see what can be done about this.Nextbit was extremely helpful in getting a replacement sent, and live chat was pleasant. Its definitely nice to see a company very open to their customers feedback. I am still puzzled how that happened however the replacement phone is working great. Awesome Job Nextbit!</br>",2016年6月15日 在美国审核

"The good, the bad, and the well...pretty","I have now owned my Robin for just under two weeks now.The good: The performance seems great - no lag that I can detect (I am coming from an iPhone 5s). Beautiful screen - bright and crisp. Build seems solid. Phone reception actually seems better than my iPhone 5s. And the phone is thinner than my iPhone 5s. I also really like the stereo speaker setup.Minimal packaging. Looks like the phone manufactures are finally getting it. I don't need a huge package with mostly air in it.The bad: Using a speaker or headphones when the phone is idle (e.g. when some music stopped playing, I just got off the phone, etc.) There is an annoying click that seems to happen about every second. When you unlock the phone, it stops, but soon as the screen shuts off, it begins. I can't tolerate it, and have to pull the jack. This does not appear to happen with a bluetooth headset.My camera has stopped functioning more than once now - requiring a power down to get it working again.Android. I don't want to be a hater, but come on, do I really need to give you permissions to things like location or microphone in order to use some of these apps that really don't need it? Yes, I am referring to built in delivered apps. Google, I don't care how much fluff and sugar coating you use to justify the gathering of my personal information. I want control over it. I am hoping that Cyanogenmod will help in this area if/when it arrives for the Robin.Battery life. The screen and phone seem to suck the juice out of this phone. I am unable to get a full day on a single charge. I have tried power management, but it does not seem to help much.Sound. Okay, I get that these are tiny speakers, but still not great.Something new that is happening - twice now the phone did not detect that I have raised to my ear to talk. The first time my cheek must have clicked the speaker phone button - which was a nice loud surprise. The second time I hung up on my call to find that I had somehow entered the notifications screen. Taking a star away.The pretty: Well, it is a great looking phone. I was an Apple fan because of form and function, and the Robin certainly covers the form side very well.Well that is my take after almost two weeks. I'll give it some more time to get comfortable and see if I can sort out the kinks before deciding if it is a keeper (or not).Update May 26, 2016: It is being returned. Too many problems with both the hardware and Android operating system. That along with Amazon not offering an exchange (requiring a return to the manufacturer if I want it repaired/replaced and a wait without a loaner). I wanted to like this phone.

Went down to ATT and picked up a new Nano Sim and it all pretty much went down hill from there,So far it is not going well. Got he phone today and was excited. Went down to ATT and picked up a new Nano Sim and it all pretty much went down hill from there. It went thru the setup process and almost immediately I noticed the home button was not turning the screen on. So I would hold home and volume down to get to reset screen. So I was thinking maybe the app restore function was causing the issue so I waited and randomly I could get the screen come on but only about 10% of the tries were successful. Then I received notification that the 6.0.1 update was available so I allowed it to process. Since then I have been unsuccessful getting the phone to do anything with the phone with the rare exception I hit the android reset screen but it doesn't help. Now I am without a phone waiting on Nextbit. I hope they handle this well. I will updates as my situation progresses.Update. Amazon is awesome as returning the bad phone and getting a new one was so easy. New phone has been doing good. The speakers are not quality and sound really cheap. I guess it's the sacrifice you make when spending less. Otherwise phone is fast and reliable so I bumped it to 3stars. Amazon gets a 5 for handling it when next bit drug their feet.,2016年5月12日 在美国审核
SCREEN CRACKS EASILY - Poor Build Quality and Design,"I purchased this phone on impulse at a Lightning deal I just couldn't pass up. After owning this phone for over 2 weeks, I am ready to write my review. I upgraded from a 2014 LG 90 with Android 4.4.2 KitKat and the difference is substantial.Much clearer and higher resolution, snappier response, better sound, better camera, and much faster and more reliable GPS. The latest android version of Marshmallow is much much better than KitKat and I believe makes a huge difference in performance and user experience. I am using T-mobile and the phone is perfectly compatible with this service.Below are my reviews based on different areas of the Robin's hardware and performance.GRAPHICS:I will give this a 9 out of 10 rating. Display has crystal clear high resolution.I'm happy with the Marshmallow's UI transparent overlays. Screen is bright and easily adjustable. Colors are vibrant, but not overbearing.Games play smoothly and GPU navigation runs beautifully.PROCESSOR: I will give this a 10 out of 10 rating. The CPU is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, which is usually found in high performance smartphones.It is very fast at 2GHz 64 bit and more than adequate for multi-tasking.SOUND:I will give this a 8.5 out of 10 rating. The two front speakers have pretty good sound and can get fairly loud.I haven't had any issues with crackling as others have reported.I believe bug fixes has solved this. The speaker phone works very good and reception is both loud and clear while talking.USER INTERFACE:10 out of 10 rating.I very much like the UI. The phone comes WITHOUT all the junk apps like my LG phone did.Notifications can be set to pop up on your screensaver which I find useful for work emails. The settings areas took a little while to get use to, but are setup well. If you swipe down twice from the top, you can see your batteries remaining charge percentage and all the options are large clickable icons to turn on/offWifi, Bluetooth, Cellular data, Location, Hotspot, Cast, Flashlight, Airplane mode, Auto-rotate, and Do not disturb mode.GPS:9 out of 10 rating. Very good. Not sure if it is the newer Marshmallow version or just the phones hardware, but it is at least 4 times faster than my old LG phone.The signal picks up very quickly and stays consistent.HOTSPOT PERFORMANCE: 10 out of 10 rating.Excellent!In case you were wondering like me about the hotspot feature, it works excellent and devices connect to it easily.I used it almost daily for the first week and had no issues what-so-ever.CAMERA:I haven't used this enough to give a good review.But the rear camera seems decent and much better than my older phone. The front camera is just ok.HEAT: I will give this a 3 out of 10 rating.Under loads, the phone can heat up quickly.Since I don't play graphic intensive games on my phone, this doesn't concern me that much. But I do think there is need for heat improvement for future releases.BATTERY / CHARGE TIME: I will give this a 5 out of 10 rating.I found the battery can sometimes drain quickly (while gaming).Overall, I think it is below average and drains much quicker than most phones.If you're not running many apps at once or using graphic intensive games, the battery lasts all day long.After trying some battery savings apps out, I decided to remove Battery Doctor and Clean Sweep, as they seem to only drain your battery more and I don't recommend using them.The battery charges very quickly (about 2 hours from 7%).I found the included USB cord to be too short (only 3 feet long), so I ordered 6' long cord from Amazon for around $10.I also am using my old LG charger for this phone and it works perfectly.BUILD QUALITY: (UPDATED) I will give this a 2 out of 10 rating. The build quality is below average for this price range.Because the phone is quite thin, I would recommend getting a hard case to prevent future accidents.It does seem more fragile than my old LG phone. You can also get a glass screen protector for around $8 on Amazon, which I recommend.10/28 Update:Due to flat top surface, the Glass screen cracks very easily.Cracked twice in less than 2 months!The body is completely plastic with no metal.Completely Failed the bend test - search youtube videos on this.BODY DESIGN:I will give this a 9 out of 10 rating.I have received some compliments on the phone and it has been described as futuristic looking.I do like that it is different from every other generic looking phone on the market.At first I wasn't sure about the Mint color, but it has really grown on me and I really like the two tone color scheme (white with mint stripes).FINGERPRINT SENSOR:I will give this a 9 out of 10 rating.I found that the only times it has rarely failed is after getting my hands wet from washing dishes.In my ""scientific opinion"", I believe the moisture in your hands may temporarily distort your fingerprints from expansion in the skin membranes.After my hands dried, the issue disappeared completely.When setting it up, the sensor reads your fingerprint from many different angles. So be sure to provide it upside down (something I did not do, but recommend).CLOUD FEATURE:Even though this is one of the phone's distinguishing features, I haven't set it up yet.I think it is a great idea, but since T-mobile hotspot is my only internet connection, I don't want to use up all my limited data on uploading / reloading from Cloud.FINAL CONCLUSION:The Robin's price tag is excellent for a modern phone with this many features. My only gripe is the phone does not have a SD slot and doesn't come with a wall charger. Nextbit also seems to want to please their customers and since the company is newly established, listens to customers' opinions and focuses on improvements.UPDATE 10/28: CHANGED FROM 5 TO 2 STARSAfter owning the phone for less than two months the screen has cracked twice!I'm not accident prone and very careful with all my electronic devices.In over 10 years I never cracked a cell phone screen before until I got this one.Due to the awkward size and shape of the phone, it is very easy to drop and crack the screen.First time I had a glass screen protector on it, which cracked once it feel face down in the parking lot. It protected the actual screen, but sure enough I dropped it again 2 weeks later when pulling it out of my pocket and it shattered the actual screen! Reason being that it is bulky and the corners are sharp and square, which will easily snag on the inside of your front pockets if your not careful.I had a hard case on it, but because the front is so flat with no lip, the glass will easily come in contact with the ground.It is also conclusive to say that the glass is very thin and not of durable quality, because both times the phone fell no more than 3 feet from the ground. Note that the first time, the $4 glass screen protector (only 0.3mm) thick only had two small cracks, but the actual screen almost shattered during the 2nd drop, both falling from the same height and same fashion (face down) onto asphalt.So now matter how careful you think you are, you are bound to eventually drop your phone, and with this one, your screwed if it falls face down.There are no replacement screens you can buy online and no hard cases available that offer adequate protection for the screen. I contacted Nextbit and found out the repair is $99 plus you pay shipping.That's $99 for a screen that doesn't even match the $4 glass screen protector!I rather spend that money on a different phone with better build design and quality.Poor build quality: The body of the phone is also completely plastic with no metal inside or out.This phone completely failed the bend test as demonstrated on youtube (you can search for this).Even budget phones much cheaper are better built and more durable.The phone also has a major overheating problem. One minute in the sun, expect it to start overheating.Run any game app and expect it to start overheating.Download a update or app more than 5MB in size and expect it to get very hot.",2016年9月6日 在美国审核

This phone and all the other androids out there will create a big uncomfortable bulge in your pocket and will become uncomfortable to use and place in your car.

The Truth about the Nextbit Robin.,"Okay so if your anything like me you do a lot of research before making any purchase especially when it comes to phone purchases. You wanna make sure your getting a good quality phone for the money your about to spend on a new device. At $160 the Robin is perfect. (And that's coming from an iPhone fanboy).××Build××Now a lot of reviewers give their opinion to help guide your decision yet none of the reviews I've seen, read or watched really gave this phone the credit it deserved. The build quality on this thing is exceptional. Kickstarter project that actually turned out not half bad. Everything is put together like it should be and this phone feels premium. (as much as a poly carbonate phone can feel) It's the perfect amount of heft to make it feel secure in your hand while also being very light weight. (It's lighter than my 7 plus I switched from) the screen is a close second to my iPhones 7 Pluses IPS LCD display. At 5.2 inches it's not as big as my 7 but watching movies on it (by the way ""Storks"" was an excellent movie) is very doable and YouTube videos look crisp.××OS××Now like I said I'm an iPhone fanboy so Android is something to get used to. If your like me and switching from an iPhone this phone is the perfect middle ground as Nextbit OS (a lightly skinned version of Android) is very close to iPhone like homesceen setup with all your apps on the home screen and no ""app drawer"" (however adding a launcher can add that feature and more if you want an even more stock Android experience). The fact that this isn't full of bloatware/apps you really don't need makes this phone snappy out of the box. The Mint color throughout though may bother some people but it doesn't bother me. Nextbit is also good at every minor detail (when you swipe through screens you get a cloudy underlay behind your apps and above your wallpaper. Looks like a foggy cloud but it's really cool!) The phone ships with Android 6.0.1 with Nuguat coming soon. So it definitely will be updated to support newer emojis and etc.××Camera××This will probably be the shortest section but if your use to Android then this camera is a close third to it's Samsung/LG/Pixel counterparts. It's not iPhone quality but it's not security footage. It's doable. The back camera (13mp) is good takes nice photos in excellent lighting so outdoor shots will look gorgeous. The front camera (5mp) is, again, not iPhone quality but it's good. It's Snapchat worthy.××Battery××This phone has a MUCH smaller batter than I'm accustomed to, however, reviewers don't give this battery credit. The first day with the phone you will need to leave it on the charger because downloading and installing apps, getting your contacts synced, setting up your accounts, etc. Will drain your battery as is expected the first day you get a phone. It comes with a USB type A to USB C cable but no charging brick. I would recommend buying a charging brick (wall port, brick, square piece thingy whatever you call it) that supports quick charge 2.0 because without it (or one of those apple chargers that come with iPads and such) your phone will charge mediocrely slow if your trying to charge and use it at the same time. This phone does however have a great battery for moderate usage and it has easily gotten me through a full day's worth of tasks (and I'm considered a power user)××Connectivity××Okay here's another vague topic that many don't talk about... It says that it doesn't support CDMA which is true HOWEVER both Verizon and Sprint use LTE which is a GSM technology. If your Verizon or Sprint phone has a sim card it CAN in fact be used with the Robin. You will not however get 3G coverage when outside of an LTE service area. Besides that you can use it on any GSM carrier as well. It has NFC so it supports Android pay. It doesn't have the magnetic field version so it will not work everywhere but only where it's supported. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 are in here as well and get great connection to both.××The Cloud××You get 32 GB storage on the phone (24.9 after formating) and 100GB additional cloud storage (free of charge). If you use up your 32 GB your Robin will automatically start backing up photos (recently Nextbit has started rolling out support for video as well as mines backs up videos) and app data to the cloud to make room. Need something just bring it down and it will be restored like it never left. Best bet is to leave the ""Backup on Wi-Fi only"" and ""When connected to charger"" settings alone unless you have an unlimited data plan and are okay with draining your battery a little faster.××Overall××It's a great phone for the price however it's not for everybody. Its for a specific niche. Also, If you want this for the fact that it's different and you like the design definitely get the Mint color as it will turn heads (I got midnight and it's interesting still but Mint will get people talking). Too many reviewers try to put it on the level of phones built by OEM's that have the money to back a phone with better specs at a lower price however nextbit did a GREAT job with this one. It's not a Pixel or iPhone but it definitely will be competition very soon later down the road. Oh and Nextbit support is great. There's only one other company with support like Nextbit and that's Apple.",2017年1月12日 在美国审核
Overheated and boiled the finish off,"While recharging, the phone got so hot it burned the finish off of the area around the speakers. The audio quality is pretty laughable even after the update.

The best Android of 2016!,"I have been cycling through high-end smartphones over the last few weeks trying to find 'the one for me'. And here it is, from left field, the beautiful Nextbit Robin! A stunning phone with great internals and a unique selling point - smart cloud connectivity. I recently got a Blackberry PRIV which is also a beautiful phone with a wonderful hardware keyboard BUT its buggy and inconsistent, runs very hot and is just well, meh! I also tried a Nexus 6P but for me its just too big and lacks any soul, although having the latest Android goodness is always good. The Sony Z5 is a really great phone too but expensive and in some ways, like the screen, just overkill. Well the Robin gives you the best of all worlds; a reasonably stock Android 6 with fast updates, great speakers, a super fast fingerprint reader in just the right place, a beautiful and unusual industrial design and that cloud smart storage. A great concept that smartly manages your storage between the built in 32GB and 100GB of free cloud storage, greying out archived apps but restoring them quickly from the cloud and automatically uploading your photos to the cloud. Hopefully Nextbit will add even more functionality to their cloud implementation moving forward as it has a lot of potential and is just so simple and 'just works' in implementation. I just love the Nextbit launcher, the gorgeous and consistent design of both hardware and software and the thoughtful implementation of Android features. The little cloud logo on the back and the 4 flashing LEDs when it is archiving to the cloud are a nice touch too. All things considered for me its the one! The best smartphone of 2016 so far by far. Keep up the great work Nextbit and all power to your cloud elbow!",2016年5月21日 在美国审核
Just Don't,"I wanted so so badly to like this phone, I really did. And the first couple weeks with it were awesome. It's incredibly stylish, and the layout is super intriguing--the graphic designer in me is still mourning the fact that I am no longer going to use it. But I need form and function, and this phone is all form no function.The camera is awful--it's slow and only in perfect lighting situations do the pictures turn out. As a social media manager I need to be able to quickly take and post images, but with this phone I can't even crop an image in their gallery app so I end up having to use 5 apps before I can, and the picture still looks bad.I can't play music and use maps at the same time, so that makes long car trips super annoying.The group messages are spotty. Sometimes they work, sometimes they just flat out don't and I miss crucial information from my coworkers and friends. Not. Cool.The regular messages are spotty. It has major issues downloading any pictures of gifs that are sent to me and sometimes just text messages and I have no idea why this is.The battery life rarely lasts a full day, and since they don't include the ""quick charger"" (which is pretty lame) you're stuck with wall chargers you already have that might take 5 hours to charge your phone. Thats insane.The finger print scanner is garbage. GARBAGE.Despite my thousands of issues I am still sad to leave this phone because it is so pretty and lightweight. And I will say that their customer service is awesome, but this phone is just not ready for 2016 it needs more time. I would consider going back to it once these issues have been ironed out.",2016年9月27日 在美国审核

Worst part they didn't offer to replace it.Update: 5 stars now from 2.It's been a year now and the phone has been discontinued, which is sad because my second experience with the phone has been a lot different and better. The bugs aren't there anymore and they have fixed the audio so no buzzing noise anymore. Also for 129.99 you won't find a phone near as good. NFC 3gb ram 32gb storagr gorilla glass screen with 1920:1080 screen. Battery life is 2.5 hours with lollipop but with 7.1 update I get close to 4 hours now. If you can find one of these to buy grab it. It's a great phone with a great price.",2016年9月28日 在美国审核

Robin review (will update when an issue comes up),"The phone feels very nice in hand. It looks flawless and beautiful. I like how it's a MIXTURE of the iPhone (when apps are automatically downloaded onto the homescreen and no app drawer) and android because of the Play store.The phone was a little hard to use since SOME FEATURES WERE MISSING and I had to find substitutes. There was no Memo, Music Player (unless you count Play Music), contacts couldn't be synced from Microsoft unless you download the Outlook app, and no stock calendar app.FEATURES that were NOT available was the sound button on the notification bar. So to turn off sound, you'd have to use the volume buttons. Battery percentage was not on the home screen. You'd have to drag the notification bar down twice to see it or while it's charging on the lock screen. There was no option to turn on battery percentage.LOCK SCREEN can be at a disadvantage when I simply want to look at the time but I accidentally unlock it. (The fingerprint lock is really responsive and works very well!) Also, it's like apple where you can either use fingerprint or the PIN.You can only set ONE WALLPAPER! You cannot set the home screen as one picture and the lock screen as another. This wasn't a big deal for me but it could be a downside for others.The CHARGING CABLE works well; however, when trying to sync my music onto the phone, it proved to be difficult. Multiple times, the phone would disconnect itself and reconnect continuously. So it was a bit of a hassle.CAMERA is a bit slow and the selfie camera would not compare to the S6 (my previous) but it was useful nonetheless.CLOUD STORAGE isn't a major thing for me so I can't really go into review on it.*UPDATE:Music has crackling noises and other video formats.Phone is stuck on 82%.Phone charges ""slowly"" although I'm using a quick charger.**Update:The charger they provided seemed to be the issue with charging. I bought myself a different cord (not theirs) and it works fine now.***Update:-Cannot crop photos on the stock app. Need a third party one to simply crop.-The back is easily scratched. I already have skinny scratches after a week's usage.UPDATE****the phone doesn't feel completely flat on tabletop for some reason.UPDATE*****After software update, the speakers sounds much better since it isnt so loud. But phone speaker is still quiet at max. WARNING the update will heat the phone by a lot. When updating, make sure its full battery (to be safe) and then update. Dont plug it into the charger or it wont work. I tried that.",2016年5月10日 在美国审核

It's as bad as I thought. Changing back to 1 star.,"So... my nextbit robin is dead again. It looks like it's dead for good this time. I'm not going to return it 'cause it's probably too late to get my money back. This phone has problems charging. First I looked in the support forums and everyone said it's the cable. So I got a new cable. It wasn't the cable. Then I read you could reboot the thing buy pressing the down button and power. That worked once or twice. And I verified it wasn't the cable. Then it worked fine for about two and a half months. Then I let it completely discharge and now it just doesn't recharge. I've had the thing for three months and it's dead, dead, dead.The support people I talked with were very nice, but ultimately this is a product that stopped working.----Second Review----Keeping myreview here for posterity... but... after getting a new charging cable and learning about the robin's quirks, it's not actually a bad phone. And... support was very responsive. Hopefully the guys at NextBit will be tackling the cable issue, but if you have charging issues, it may be the cable. Also, the connector where the USB-C cable plugs in *feels* mushy, but it hasn't broken and it still works, maybe that's a feature of USB-C or maybe i'm just sensitive to it.----ORIGINAL REVIEW----When this phone works, it's not bad. The things I don't like about it aren't unique to the robin, but problems with Android in general.But the phone I received does not charge reliably with the included USB-C cable. Support responded within 24 hours (which was in line with expectations) and a suggested fix worked once. Further interactions with support were seemingly useless; they insisted things I was seeing weren't happening. Specifically, the phone refused to charge while turned off. Support insisted this wasn't the case. I was eventually able to boot the phone into recovery mode, fastboot, then explicitly power off and then it started charging.The problem I encountered with this phone is it stopped charging after I plugged it in. The battery then died overnight and it won't charge in power-off mode after you've let the battery completely drain. (or at the very least it's charging so slowly it doesn't have enough juice to power the screen to display the battery icon indicating it's charging while in power-off mode.)Suggestions from the official support account were more or less useless and obvious like ""try plugging it in"" and ""you're obviously plugging it into a charger that doesn't work."" I empathize with the support team; many people do overlook simple fixes to common problems. But in this case I don't think it's a simple problem (I double checked my recovery procedure after receiving a response from support.)Suggested fixes on the support forum included reflashing the boot rom with a beta version of the rom. i'm not quite sure this is appropriate for a consumer product.In any event, if they can fix the charging problem I'll change my review. I really WANT this phone to work and I want the small team behind this product to give ""the big guys"" a run for their money. But they're going to have to build a phone that charges when you plug it in first.",2016年7月18日 在美国审核

With very very light messaging. It went from 100% to 60% in a matter of 3 hours. On top of that. The speaker sound is pretty bad. They crackle andall you can hear is static through them. The bottom speaker has a distinct crackling sound that is just awful. I tried to live this phone, I think they solved the storage issue quite nicely and elegantly.

Conceptually great but not ready for market.,"I consider myself a phone enthusiast and I currently alternate between Nexus 6P and Galaxy Note 5. I purchased the Nextbit Robin during the $299 sale and am returning it after using it for only one day.<br>The phone is quite aesthetically pleasing. It is thin, light-weight, and build quality on my unit was excellent.I updated the phone to the most current version before setting it up and using the phone. There are numerous software problems which make the device unusable to anyone who intends for it to be their daily driver.After experiencing these issues I visited the Nextbit forums and there are many people reporting a multitude of issues.The issues I experienced are as follows:- Wifi would disconnect and reconnect every 5 minutes interrupting what I was doing. This occurred on multiple networks in different locations and even sitting next to the router. It was clearly not related to signal strength.- The sound setting would only be acceptable if you have no intention of ever using any sound. The speaker quality is very poor and the default equalization setting makes music and speech sound distorted.The first sound setting above mute is obnoxiously loud---so much so that it hurts my ears, and it only gets louder from there.I would suggest anyone who is considering purchasing this item visit the Nextbit support forums and look over the issues people are reporting.TLDR -- build quality is good, software feels like an alpha and is not ready to be your daily driver.</br>",2016年5月14日 在美国审核

Growing Pains,"I backed the Nextbit Robin at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.After reading several reports of early backers having issues with the body warping due to heat issues I started second guessing my decision.My phone arrived without the Bruises case I ordered and I decided to wait on using it.After almost another month and still nothing from Nextbit I ordered an Orzly Fusion case that had just become available on Amazon.Thinking finally my patience had paid off I put in my (cut) T-Mobile SIM card and the phone refused to recognize it.I contacted Nextbit who suggested buying a new SIM card.I did, and that seems to have fixed that problem.After using my Robin for several days I noticed I had an issue with the screen not coming on when the power button was pushed.Again I contacted Nextbit who said this was a known issue that would be resolved with the Android 6.01 update being pushed out in April.The update was released on schedule but failed to resolve the problem.(Update 1) Thanks to Sarah F. at Nextbit I received my replacement Robin promptly.I’ve been using it now for about 2 weeks and have not experienced either of the issues I had previously.I did however have a problem sending/receiving SMS at first but, resetting the Access Point Names resolved it.On T-Mobile a MMS/WiFi bug seems to exist but I found a workaround by switching my default messaging app to Textra that supports “T-Mobile WiFi calling fix” in MMS settings.(Update 2) The June update was just released which address the issue with volume levels and the “snap crackle pop” from the speakers you would sometimes hear (varied based on sound/music type).It has taken a while to convince me, but with this latest update and recent sales promotions (I paid more as a Kickstarter backer) I would recommend Robin to anyone who: (1) are moderate phone users (my battery lasts all day), (2) hate pre-installed bloatware on their phones, (3) believe timely Android updates are important, (4) have an interest in flashing custom ROMs like Cyanogenmod, (5) appreciate an active community of employee/end-user support.I believe the Nextbit team should be commended for all the hard work on delivering a crowd supported phone more/less on schedule, with the promised features intact, and for their customer service efforts.The Android 6.01 update has fixed the slow camera which was the most common complaint with the initial release and also confirmed Nextbit’s commitment to timely Android updates.Now that Nexbit’s terrible twos are behind them I believe consumers buying a Robin now are more likely to have a positive experience then early backers.",2016年4月30日 在美国审核

Love this phone!,"I got this phone from Kickstarter, so I have for almost a year and love it.I had the Nexus 5 before which I really loked too but this one is one step above it.The main things I love:- the fingerprint reader integrated into the power button on the side of the device: I unlock my phone faster than anyone else.- it is very thin and light BUT has a really nice texturized material that makes it non slippy. It never slipped out of my hand (which is my main complain about other phones) and it just feels nice.- good battery life: I had about 15h on my Nexus 5, I have about 20h on this one.- good perfs: the fact that the screen is 1080p and not more makes the perf better and the 3gb of ram makes going back and forth between apps really nice.- the team fixes issues quite regularly: the sound too loud issue is fixed, initial setup bug fixed, some perf and battery issues fixed.- almost fully vanilla Android (just need to switch the launcher back to Google's one)Things that are not so great:- the camera: it works pretty well in daylight (especially the focus which is ultra crisp) but in low light it's not great: blurry, not crisp.- the custom launcher: I disabled it the first day and switched back to google launcher, so it's a very easy to fix problem, takes 30 seconds.- the notification light at the bottom, next to the USB port: it's pretty hard to see and is only one color.All in all, I'm about to buy another one because it's now $169 and for that price its an incredible phone.",2016年11月13日 在美国审核
The phone doesn't has a SD slot but does come with 32GB which should be fine for most people,"Normally a near two year old discontinued phone isn't on my radar but I recently got this phone new for $109 as a backup/travel phone.It should be noted Nextbit that after July 31st 2017 Nextbit will not be honoring warranties and the 100GB cloud storage most likely will be shutdown at some point.The phone doesn't has a SD slot but does come with 32GB which should be fine for most people.The phone has a striking modern design which is composed of brightly colored poly carbonate.The phone is thin and a tad awkward to hold do to it's rectangular shape and slippery surface.The front facing speakers are nice but aren't terrible loud and add a lot of height to the phone.The side fingerprint reader is surprisingly the best I have used even compared to Apple and Samsung.When the phone is updated to Android N the front and back camera are decent but don't have the low light performance or color reproduction of a modern day flagship phone.Battery life with the somewhat small 2680 mah on Android 7 update has been average to bellow average depending on use.I still need to test battery life out more but in the two days of use I have been able to get through my day 7:00AM to 7:00PM.The phone uses USB C and does offer quick charge but Nextbit does not provide a wall charger.This is with adaptive brightness on, WIFI on all day, LTE on, BT off, Cloud sync off, Locations on, notifications on.The 808 processor and 3GB of ram can handle really any day to day tasks you through at it but the phone does get hot with the 808 processor and the phone will occasionally slow down especially if you are heavily multitasking or downloading something.You are reminded this is an older phone with the screens black letter box bezel, but the screen itself at 1080P isn't bad besides it it not being bright enough at times.At the end of the day this is really a great backup phone secondary phone, travel phone since it's unlocked, or a phone to just tinker around with since it has an unlocked bootloader.With this being said it is very questionable if this phone will get Android O from Nexbit, but since there is a fairly decent sized Nextbit Robin community and the bootloader is unlocked I wouldn't be surprised to see a custom ROM from the Android community for 1-3 years even.For a $109 almost two year old phone, everyone at work was asking me about my Nextbit Robin since the look and feel is so different compared to Samsung, Apple, and their copycat competitors.",2017年7月20日 在美国审核
"Great phone, especially at this price.","I bought this phone new, not from Amazon, but I would like to post my impressions for anyone considering buying one.I researched it before buying, and the reviews were mostly from early to mid 2016 and somewhat mixed but leaning towards the positive. Most complaints were about battery life and the camera lag and some mentioned the phone getting hot. I received the phone on March 23rd, and luckily the new upgrade to nougat was just made available, along with some security updates. There was also an update from September 2016, so right out of the box there was about an hours worth of updates, that went smoothly with no hiccups.I have used it for about a week. The battery life has beenmore than adequate. I hesitate to say exceptional, since I haven't owned that many different phones, but I don't worry about making it through the day. I haven't noticed the phone getting hot, or even warm. And the camera starts quickly and there's not much shutter lag. So for anyone unsure of this this phone based on the earlier reviews, I would say that the issues mentioned in them have been addressed.So here is what I like so far about the Robin:Well built and attractive.Great screen, videos and pictures look crisp with nice color.Front facing speakers that are loud enough, and have good sound that accents the midrange somewhat.Fingerprint reader/power button combo that works well.Internet works faster than my previous phones.Pretty much stock, clean Android with a few enhancements and no additional crappy apps to clutter up your screen. It doesn't really have an app bin, you just scroll through pages. That's the one big difference from stock Android but I put Arrow launcher on it, and it worked fine, so if you don't like not having an app bin, it's an easy fix.Of concern is the fact that Nexbit was bought out by Razer, and the phone has been discontinued. They have promised to keep supporting the phone until sometime in 2018. But you are getting a phone that originally sold for $400 for around $150. I couldn't find a comparable phone in that price range.",2017年3月29日 在美国审核
A Promising Idea that Falls Flat on Execution - Cannot Recommend At All,"TLDR:The Nextbit Robin is a very interesting looking phone that is not ready for prime time. There are several serious hardware issues and minor software issues that affect nearly every single interaction with the phone. This phone might prove to be more compelling in 6 months when the price is even lower and the manufacturing and software issues are ironed out. Look at the Nextbit forums - all of the issues I've experienced are being widely reported in their own enthusiast community.I've owned this phone for a little over 2 weeks now and I feel bad but I am going to have to return the device. I REALLY wanted to like it but unfortunately there are way too many issues and compromises for me to justify the price and the day to day experience.I'll start with some positives about the Robin:- I was really drawn by the industrial design of the phone. The right angles and flat planes along with the very cool mint accents is very visually appealing to me.- The default Nextbit launcher is very iOS-like which I initially liked as I am an iPhone user since the first iPhone back in 2007- The packaging is unique and a great user experience. I know it's minor but it gives a great first impression as a device that was made and presented with care.- Great feel in the hand. Even though the exterior of the phone is plastic, it has a nice heft to it. While I generally don't like devices that are too thin (I have to keep my iPhone in a case because its too thin and slippery) the Robin's flat planes and right angle edges help it stay firmly in the hand.- Qualcomm Quick Charge tech is awesome. I hope all manufacturers incoporate this cool feature.- None of the bloatware that I've been reading about for years that comes standard on the majority of Android phones.- Carrier unlocked SIM card slot. This was one of the key selling points for me.- Encrypted storage by default. Not sure if Google mandates this or Nextbit enabled it but it was great not having to encrypt the phone after setting it up and waiting 40 minutes for the encryption process to finish.Now that I've listed what I like about the phone, let's move onto my reasons why I must return the device.Hardware Issues:- Power button doesn't always power on/off the display. I would say 1 out of 4 times I press the power button and receive no response.- Fingerprint sensor fails to verify my fingerprints 50% of the time. This is EXTREMELY frustrating. On my iPhone, the TouchID sensor basically never fails to read my fingerprint, unless my finger is wet.- Fingerprint sensor is in an inconvenient (for me) location since I am left handed. I've registered my right thumb and my left index finger in order to be able to hold the phone with either hand but realistically the left hand index finger almost never passes finger print verification.- Front facing camera is horrible quality. Any and all selfies taken with this device come out super grainy and remind me of pics taken 6 or 7 years ago when front facing cameras were still relatively rare and never used for video calls- Fit and Finish: the top and bottom mint end caps feel loose and flex way too easily for my comfort. I am worried that if this phone is dropped that these end pieces will either fly off or develop a giant crack in them. They just feel too flimsy.- The back surface of the phone does not feel like a level plane, but instead like it has some raised or depressed portions (very slight). I can't take pictures to demonstrate this but I can definitelly feel it. I hope it is the housing that is slightly warped and not the battery warping which could lead to a catastrophic failure and then a fire if it is deforming.- Phone gets EXTREMELY hot. Other than Words with Friends (2 or three words played per day only) I don't play games on the phone. It will get hot browsing the web in Chrome or browsing my podcasts library in Pocket Casts. Also while charging the phone the heat gets really intense.- Battery life is terrible - most days I am charging the phone by 5pm because It's hovering around 20% or so. Typical use is light texting throughout the day, Pocket Casts app most of the work day, alternating between wired and bluetooth headphones. I should not be seing almost 10% per hour discharge rate with this usage pattern.- LED Notification Light - coming from iOS this is the only hardware feature that I've consistently been jealous of. I used to have it on my BlackBerry back in the day and really missed it at first when I switched to iPhone. The implementation here is questionable. Is it common to not locate a notification LED on either the front or back of the phone? Also not having an LED that supports multiple colors seems to be a huge missed opportunity. Any and all notifications that trigger the LED look the same to me, if i even notice them.- USB-C cable support - I understand the positives for using this type of cable (mainly transfer speed and ability to insert cable without worrying about orientation) but I have issues with USB-C cables in genreal and specifically the one included in the box.- The USB-A end of the included cable (the connector that plugs into a AC adaptor or a computer) can be inserted backwards into a USB-A female port. Was it cheaper to make the cable in this manner or was it for a unique look? I worry that someone who isn't paying attention can damage a USB port.- USB-C cables are way too stiff for my liking. For charging at home this is a minor annoyance but in the car it is extermely inconvenient to have a 3 foot cable that cannot be tamed and randomly catches on things. This has occured with the included cable and an aftermarket USB-C cable.- Lack of an included AC adapter. At minimum a non Quick Charge AC adapter should be included. It's a phone, not a FitBit with a tiny battery that charges in 20 minutes over USB.Software:- When Battery Saver is active, some apps are essentially broken because touch input is not recognized. This appears randomly, but only when Battery Saver is active. I don't know why this occurs and I don't have the time or the patience to figure it out.- In 2016, it is simply inexcusable that the Gallery app does not support cropping photos. I don't get why NextBit even bothered to expend the engineering resources to develop this app. My guess is that if they allowed the user to Google Photos by default, then the value proposition of the Smart Storage is vastly diminished since Google Photos offers photo backup in the cloud.- The Camera app is terrible. I should not have to pray that the camera app launches in time for me to get a pic of my niece before I miss the moment.- Lowest volume setting is way too loud and the phone is unusable in a house late at night where others may be sleeping nearby. Thankfully, I found a solution in the Nextbit forums -an app that helps tune the speakers a bit lower but I shouldn't have to do this in first place in my opinion.- The Nextbit launcher is very limiting. The app icons are way too large and the permanent placement in the lower right of the purple launcher button seems like a waste of screen space. Also, the option to view All Apps takes way too long to transition to the full list of installed apps. This is a minor issue since I discovered and installed Google Now launcher.- Initial phone setup was less than ideal. When I powered the phone on, the phone appeared to download some Android related updates. After finishing up my Google user setup I was on the home screen. Then the phone proceeded to download Google Play store updates for every included Google app which took too long in my opinion. Lastly, the phone notified me that the April Nextbit update was available so it proceeded to download and install that. I assume this is more an Android issue and how updates are handled out of the box rather than Nextbit's implementation but it was not great to see an hour of updates right out of the box.- I know its not fair to compare my iPhone 6 against this phone, but even at half the price for the Robin, many of these issues are just not acceptable. Reliable fingerprint sensors are the minimum table stakes, not nice high end flagship features in today's security conscious environment. If working correctly, the user should forget they even have a fingerprint sensor in the phone. The Robin does do this... but only sometimes for me.The hardware issues unfortunately are what drove my decision to return the device. I don't want to deal with a faulty device and I also don't want to go through the RMA and exchange process. There are simply too many issues and my level of confidence in receiving a ""perfect"" device as a replacement is not very high.As for the software issues, I believe the Nextbit team will eventually address these issues. In the mean time I had to do research to find alternative apps to fix the issues experienced to provide the functionality that I felt was missing from the built in software, such as cropping photos(!).I'd like to add the caveat that while I've used an iPhone for years, I am not anti-Android or a fanboy that likes to get into OS arguments. I have an Android tablet (Lenovo Yoga Tab 2) and as you can see the majority of my issues are with the hardware, not Android as a platform.Edit: I forgot to include the Nextbit Robin does not support T-Mobile WiFi Calling or WiFi texting. My typical use for my iPhone is to place it in Airplane Mode and enable WiFi to save on battery when I arrive at home. This enables me to make and receive all calls and all texts (SMS and iMessages) over WiFi, without having to rely on some 3rd party app like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, or Skype as a hack to receive calls and messages on WiFi. I believe the Samsung Galaxy phones and many other devices on Android also support this type of use and was surprised it is not supported on Nextbit. My guess is that it must be certified with each network operator and Nextbit has not gone through this process yet.August 2016 Edit: I also forgot to mention that the phone refused to work with my stereo head unit which is a ",2016年5月25日 在美国审核
Really nice phone with really only 1 flaw as far as I'm concerned,"This phone is VERY good and very good looking.The one detail that took it down to 4 stars is the battery.It's not terrible battery life, but it's not great. I regularly plug in at work and in my car, so it's normally not a problem, but I don't get why they didn't put a bigger battery in it.The quick charging is a plus because when you do need to charge it can be done quickly.On a day where I'm not regularly charging it, I can make it through a whole day with moderate use, but anything above moderate and I'm scrambling for a charger in the evening.The phone looks sleek and unique.I have it in a case, but even with that it looks good and is thin.Fits easily in my pocket.At 5.2"", the screen is the perfect size.5"" seems too small for me now, and 5.5"" is too big.It's plenty detailed and plenty bright.I even have one of those fuzzy glare reducing screen protectors on it and it still looks good.Sound is loud from both speakers.Phone calls are clear.The BIGGEST surprise to me as far as features I like is the fingerprint reader integrated into the power button.I don't know if any other companies do this, but they should all copy it.It works nearly flawlessly as it almost always recognizes my fingerprint on the first try.I LOVE this feature - I never use the screen pattern to unlock my phone anymore.",2017年3月30日 在美国审核

However, my current phone, a OnePlus One has a camera that doesn't embarrass you and works reliably. This phone does not.Good points:Price is reasonable for a smartphone.Stereo speakers give you great sound.Uses Cloud for storage, and unused apps get moved to the Cloud instead of taking up memory on your phone.Not-so-good points:Fingerprint sensor seems to fail half the time. So instead of reading it, it's annoying.The phone on/off is twitchy. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't Camera is not great at all. Fuzzy, dull pictures.Phone heats up when charging or when using web for extended times. My current phone also gets hot but not THIS hot.

"The camera takes very good pics, front or back","I'm giving this phone a 5 star review even though it has some flaws. I've been using this as my main phone for about 2 months now and it's been updated to Android 7.1.1 which is the highest it can go. It's very fast, and has ample ram (3 gb) making most applications open almost instantly. The camera takes very good pics, front or back...although the flash is a little dimmer than I'd like. It has 32gb of onboard storage and 100gb of cloud storage, but I'd much rather it had a micro sd card. The usb type-c connector makes it rather awkward when trying to find a car charger (or a replacement cable for home charger), other accessories such as bluetooth headsets and phone cases are fairly easy to find online. Phone does get a little warm during intensive usage but not too bad. Audio playback is decent, but the two front facing speakers are kinda tiny, so don't expect dolby surround sound or anything.

"Phone is nice, simple, beautiful, and amazing.","Luv it. Simple, beautiful, and performs really well.I will review this with my experience in 2 months with this phone , not including technical info, since I prefer real world experience than mere benchmarks, etc.Screen is above average, ofc not as amazing as Samsung 's, but it's still nice to look at.Performance of the phone is actually pretty fast, opens up pretty quick, the amount of ram in it lets me multitask easily and effortlessly. No lag, quick and not problematic.The speakers are great. They are front facing, and the loudness of it is obviously not as great as the all mighty BoomSound speakers of htc, but the volume is still better than most other phones.Battery is actually OK, lasts me most of the time for the whole day, but there are times I lost charge midday, like the time I was using snapchat all the time during a Beyoncé concert lol.Camera was actually really nice. With lighting it will perform superb, but on low light, it is acceptable. I was able to take amazing photos with it.The best part about this phone, is the unique design. It's so beautiful, and it's so unusual. Having a phone that's legit shaped like a box, instead of those curved corners. For me, it felt like a premium. It's amazing. And the compliments,and the amount of people noticing my phone are A LOT. It's been 2 months, and I still get compliments from people.Ever since I received this phone in mid August, the phone until now has changed a bit. Since this phone is fairly new to the market with a new growing company behind its creation, problems are bound to occur. Luckily, I have received updates after updates after updates, resulting to a now better performing phone. The lag that I used to experience multiple times, was finally fixed with an update. The audio problem, distortion at full volume, is now fixed. Random pausing of music, now fixed. And many more.They also are now focusing on adding features on the phone, and the one I found is the added editing tool in the gallery. Ofc I use an app to edit some pictures on my phone, but things like these helps out to make the phone fuller.",2016年10月20日 在美国审核
"Good phone, but no support-- not worth the money","The best feature about this phone, the unlimited cloud storage, is no longer supported. Since Razer purchased this company, they have discontinued support and removed the cloud storage feature.Overall, I really enjoyed having this phone, but it is definitely not worth the money for what it is. If the battery dies (as mine has after less than ONE YEAR of owning, bought it before realizing Razer had bought the company) or if you experience any problems, you will receive no support. You cannot take apart the phone easily (no replacing battery).Pictures it takes are very nice. It has sufficient storage space and a beautiful design. Fits in your hand well, and feels very durable (I have a very cheap plastic/rubber case, never had any issues).

Functions smoothly,"In my experience so far, the Nextbit Robin functions smoothly and reliably.In general, the phone is comfortable to hold, although since it is very thin, I am somewhat concerned that I may drop it, and I plan on purchasing a TPU case for better grip. The screen seems to be proportioned a bit taller and narrower than I'm used to (11.5 x 6.5 cm), but the clarity is good and the colors are bright. I'm able to see the screen in bright daylight without problems, assuming the brightness is turned up.The fingerprint reader was easy to set up, and seems to be fairly reliable. On startup, the backup numerical PIN is required to access the phone.The power button/fingerprint reader is located on the right side of the phone, and the volume buttons are on the left, such that I have to be careful not to darken the screen unintentionally when adjusting the volume. I suppose I’ll get used to gripping the phone in such a way as to avoid this.The camera is quick to open and focus, and is able to lock on items as close as 4 cm from the lens. The video is smooth, without “shuddering” or momentary freezes, but since this phone has a fast processor and 3 GB RAM, I would be surprised if that were not the case.The speakers sound pretty good, with clear upper range fidelity, although the volume is not particularly impressive. Turning them up to maximum gain adds a bit of distortion at high points. The stereo effect is noticeable when the phone is held in landscape mode.In general, the phone feels snappy and smooth; I haven’t noticed any delays or lagging when scrolling. I haven’t experienced unusual heat or excessive battery drain that some others have reported here, although perhaps that is primarily seen when playing games, which I don’t do.The Nexbit Launcher is not that different from the Google Now Launcher, except that Google Now cards are not available, and the names of the apps are hard to read (see pictures). There is in addition an icon for access to all of the apps (archived, i.e. backed up to the cloud; pinned, i.e. always on the phone; and All apps).As far as the built-in 32 GB storage is concerned, it will probably be some time before I get to the point where, having added sufficient music, video and images to the phone, a substantial amount of data will be offloaded to the cloud storage provided by Nextbit. By default, this transfer is limited to times when WiFi is available, and since I have a limited data plan, this is a necessity.It would have been nice had the package included a charging attachment in addition to the USB-C cable, but they are easy enough to obtain. Still, at the price being asked…",2016年8月25日 在美国审核
The phone is awesome with few exceptions,"The phone is awesome with few exceptions. Average battery and camera. But if you compare the phone with the same phones in it's class, the Robin absolutely destroys them.You just won't find a better phone for the price. Software is stable, speakers are great, the design of phone is unique, and screen is crisp and bright. On top of that it has quick charge 2.0 which compensates for average battery. It can handle gaming great.I recommend you pick the phone up if you are in the market for a mid range smart phone and you don't want to be paying $600-$700. Highly recommended.I1/6/18 update: This phone lasted under a year. Given I dropped it a few times and had a top rated case on it. I'm guessing since the phone's internals are mainly plastic that may have something to do with it. The phone went completely dead and will not power on. Since the phone has been discontinued by the manufacturer, it is a massive risk for anyone thinking about purchasing this phone. There has not been a security patch since April 2017 although Razer has promised software support through February 2018.Buy at your own risk. I had to remove 3 stars due to the poor durability.

A good basic phone built on a flawed premise,"I love all the basics of this phone.The physical design is perfect.The feel in my hand is exactly what I want. the screen is great. The speakers are totally fine. It's running a near-pure version of Android. The cameras are what I expect from this range of phone.While all the basics are wonderful, the very premise the phone is built around is deeply flawed.I'm referring of course to the cloud based system which swaps out apps and pictures so that 32GB can last you as long as you need. In theory. The biggest hurdle is that the cloud-based swap system ONLY handles photos and apps. Meaning, if I wanted to access my entire music collection locally (doable on most other phones through a external memory slot) it's not happening here.Also, the data costs associated with swapping entire apps (or god forbid, games!) in and out while on the go would eventually add up.Nextbit has a great basic premise here. But they need to drop the cloud nonsense, add a card slot and drop the price to around $300.",2016年9月17日 在美国审核

This was a problem I had from day 1 but I thought it happened from downloading apps and getting it set up.2) The battery has trouble recharging/rebooting if I run it flat. It has happened a couple of times but it seems to eventually pick up the charge (sometimes an hour+ later in the charger). Based on reviews, many people had battery issues.3) Although the design is excellent and the phone feels really light and slick... IT IS VERY FRAGILE! The built is plastic and almost mushy when it drops, so even slightest drop will leave a dent. I must have dropped it a total of 4 times and one time the screen popped up from the plastic around the edges. Now it fell off a table on one of its corner and the screen got absolutely shattered. Could not find replacement screens and did not expect to find any to begin with.4) Low light camera is awful. Otherwise, it is decent.",2018年1月3日 在美国审核

"The Nextbit Robin is a masterpiece of a phone, but cloud-based solutions are available without a Robin.","Ahh... The Nextbit Robin. A phone made by some very sneaky developers that jumped out of the cloud. Wait a second. I just said cloud. The phone is the cloud! Man, this phone is AWESOME! I donated $100 to Nextbit on Kickstarter to see what invention they could create with. I'm very picky when donating money on Kickstarter so my money isn't thrown away, but I knew that the team at Nexbit knew what they were doing, instead of stealing donated money. As for the phone itself, it is quite gorgeous, even with its quite loud aquamarine color. The 2 stereo frontfacing speakers are one of the best, and the cameras aren't shabby either. For camera quality, just expect poor resolution, which is quite normal for smartphones in the $400 range. Also, the cloud-based storage solution made by Nextibit is revolutionary, but it's only revolutionary when they do it right. Here is where the Robin fails at. With the cloud-based solution, you can save apps you don't need back into the cloud, but Nexbit only gives you 100GB of cloud storage, so this isn't going to be considered unlimited storage. If you want to bring back an app from the cloud, the Robin will have to ""redownload"" it back into the system for you to use the app. However, you can also use other cloud solutions on your Robin, and make it contain unlimited storage. However, all smartphones can use free cloud solutions with unlimited storage, so if you already have a phone &amp; your internal storage is out, you can just use OneDrive or Google Drive or any other cloud storage solution. The Robin is quite an oddball out of all the smartphones. Yes, Nexbit has created their own special cloud based solution for the Robin, but cloud based solutions have been out many years ago before the Robin. Even with those drawbacks, I have used the Robin as a server phone, to store any important documents when I can't reach my computer. To sum up this review, the Robin is quite a phone for it's money, but phones that cost less than the Robin can also use cloud based solutions.

Beautiful and functional phone!,"I ordered the Nextbit Robin via Kickstarter. I've been using it for over 2 months, and I've been happy with it so far.First of all, this is a good-looking phone. A lot of people (both male and female) stop me to ask what phone I have. The mint green phone with the blue bumps case is especially eye-catching. Dust does get into the holes on the bumps case, so I remove the case periodically to wipe it. I also use the scratches case sometimes, which is significantly lighter, and the tempered glass screen protector. I was worried about the white plastic getting dirty, but it's held up well so far.The fingerprint recognition on the power button is extremely convenient. Now unlocking with a PIN just feels clumsy. You can store multiple fingerprints as well.I haven't maxed out the 25GB on my phone yet, so I can't comment on the 100GB Smart Storage capabilities.The phone does not come with bloatware.The battery life is good compared to all other Android phones I've owned. As a heavy phone user who feels nervous whenever I have less than 50% battery left, I used to charge my phone a couple of times a day and carry portable chargers with me, but now I can almost always make it through the day without recharging. The mint green cable is the most attractive cable that I own. The quick charger gets my battery from nearly empty to 100% in less than an hour.The phone isn't perfect, but it's the best Android phone I've owned. (I've gone through various HTC, Samsung, and Google models since 2009.) The camera app initially shipped with some lagginess, but it was fixed in the update a few days ago.

Nextbit has created a great phone; They listen to customer feedback with updates!!,"As a startup coming off Kickstarter I was skeptical, but Nextbit has really pulled it off. The phone has a great chip, the Snapdragon 808, runs apps fast and screen quality is excellent.When the phone was first launched the battery life was the most aggrevating thing about the phone and after using for about a month was considering getting a different phone. However, Nextbit came through and released their April Update, albeit a bit late in the first week of May, which significantly improved battery performance. Also, did not notice any drop in phone performance. The battery lasts an entire day +more with moderate use with about 40-50% battery life to spare. With heavy use I usually get down to about 20% with gaming apps and playing video. The other great improvement they made with the update is camera performance; previously the shutter lag was about 1 second. Nowit is much more seamless; it takes great photos for a mid-range phone. The Nextbit OS overlay and cloud software is pretty awesome, and I love it. Nextbit has added features additional to the standard Android OS such as battery optimization/battery savers; standard Android OS does very little in batter saver mode.So the main main reason I gave 5 stars is not just for the phone, but also for Nextbit. When you buy the phone you are in good hands. The company listens to customer feedback and responds beautifully with excellent updates.Cons are the cloud software does not backup video, but Nextbit has stated that it is slated for future updates. And currently there is no way to manage with the cloud storage except for the cloud options and picking which apps to pin to your phone. Hopefully this was also be included in future updates.",2016年5月20日 在美国审核

Lots of phone for the price,"I was looking for a new phone that was something different and unique. The Robin was fit the bill (and was reasonably priced).In addition to the cloud storage (a cool feature that could even help your phone's performance by sending the apps away thereby preventing unnecessary battery drain and background data usage). The phone has great forward thinking features, including those that are on today's flagship phones such as the fingerprint reader, USB-C, and pretty good quality double front facing speakers.Performance is zippy and comparable to those with better specs. I did not notice much lag, but I also don't play many graphics-intensive games.The phone has held up pretty well thus far. I've dropped it once, and luckily I had the ""bumps"" case and the phone didn't sustain any damage. If I had any criticism of the phone, it's the speed of the camera; it has much lag between press and capturing. However I hear the latest April 2016 update will rectify this issue. Otherwise, the quality is pretty good.Overall a solid phone with really neat features. Especially if you enjoy tinkering around with your phone (i.e., rooting, getting new ROMS, etc.)",2016年4月26日 在美国审核

The Windows Vista of Smartphones,"This is a terrible product. As many others have noted both here and in the Nextbit community forum, there are major issues with the sound and Wi-Fi. Want to stream video from Hulu or Netflix on high quality with no graininess? Not going to happen. Want to listen to Spotify or Pandora without having the audio get choppy and dependent on how you position the audio jack? Nope to that too. Think that the lowest audio setting isn't going to be loud enough to get you a stare on the subway or in a coffee shop? Not that either. Beside that, the Wi-Fi can be so slow that you can expect to wait up to 10 minutes to download a 25 MB app like Audible from the Google Play Store. This review doesn't even get into the other issues people have complained about regarding the slow camera that under-performs in low lighting and the random app crashes that overheats the back of the device.Hold on to your money and buy something without the shoddy craftsmanship, like an unlocked Nexus 5X or OnePlus 2 (both about $350). You'll save about $50 and get a charger with your phone too!P.S. I contacted Nextbit Help about the issues and their response was literally ""Cool, well that stuff is beyond my paygrade :)"".

"Excellent phone, outstanding value. The design alone has generated many remarks.","I backed this phone on Kickstarter knowing that there was risk associated with backing such a project. Many smartphone projects have come and gone on crowdfunding sites with nothing to show for it. While I was prepared for the risk, I was fairly confident in Nextbit's ability to deliver. Tom Moss and Mike Chan were former Google-ers (Developers on the original Android project through ~2.3ish) and have a history of developing excellent Software products (Nextbit Baton being the primary one). The addition of Scott Croyle (former HTC Design lead) solidified, for me, their pedigree for designing and bringing to market an Android phone, and do it with security and smart design. I received my Robin in February and it has been the only phone I have used since. The User Interface is a very lightly skinned version of stock Android and the best marriage between iOS and Android UX philosophies. The main feature, however, is the Cloud-based storage integration designed directly into Robin. While I have not had to test it yet on my Robin (the phone itself has 32GB of storage on board), I have no doubts, based on all of the feedback from people who have, that it will work exactly as designed.The Camera is as good as any on a phone in this range, and Nextbit are continuously improving the software, in partnership with DXO.Battery life is acceptable. I use the phone for ~2 hours of phone calls per day (some days much more) and the battery lasts until I go to bed. On the days where usage is far heavier than normal, a quick 20 minutes on the QuickCharger tops it off and gets me through the day without issue.Size wise, it is nearly ideal for me. I am happy with any screen size from 5.0 - 5.5"". The Robin is 5.2"" and fits perfectly in my hands, and doesn't feel bulky in my pocket.Excellent phone overall, and I have no desire to upgrade until Nextbit announces a follow-up.",2016年4月27日 在美国审核
Incredible phone for the price!,"For the price this phone is a steal.This has gone on sale twice on amazon for $200 and you can routinely find sellers selling it for under $250.What makes this phone magical is the way it manages onboard and cloud storage together.The phone manages your storage on the phone with your cloud storage to make sure you don't run out of space.If you don't use a program for a period of time it will uninstall it but you can easily install it back again.How many times have you downloaded an app, then mess with it and completely forget to delete it.So it just sits there taking up space on your phone.The robin takes care of that.Have you seen those commercials where people are taking a picture and the ""out of space"" box pops up?Well that's not going to happen here.This phone is surprisingly well made for a new company.The OS is really nice and I find it easy to use.The camera takes really good pictures.Not as good as the galaxy s7 or iphone7 but this phone is a fraction of the price of those phones.Overall for the price I don't think you are going to find a better cell phone.Will it replace a galaxy S7 or Iphone 7, no....but it's not supposed too.It's a great, very reasonably priced unlocked smart phone.Big win in my book.",2016年9月26日 在美国审核

And I didn't even get a good phone, and I'm still yet to even get half of my money back. it was great at first, except the bezel that takes up 20% of the whole front of the phone, The speakers were cool and so was the power and battery life, and fingerprint scanner, it was great. Then suddenly I spent the whole day away from home, and when I got back, the phone suddenly decided it no longer wanted to work! Nothing worked, Restarting it, I tried charging while it was off, I tried every single USB dongle I had in my house, even my MacBooks USB port... Furious.. I feel like smashing my phone because even if I sent it back I feel like another Indian retard lady will be assigned to my case and I won't get a dime of my 340$ back...I will never buy this phone or any phone again from Nextbit and maybe even amazon.I urge you to not buy this phone by any means because I'm sure that you will face a different problem one way or another because almost everyone I've seen with this phone had a complaint.

The New refreshing MINTY worth the TRY???,"First of I have to say is that Nextbit Robin is part of Kickstarter campaign and it received a very good response from the public.....Nextbit sells Robin in the name of a PHONE That never run out of space (But you only have 32gigs of onboard + 100gigs of cloud storage , which is not infinite)LOOKS - As in the ad ROBIN LOOKS BADASS and stands out from all the similar devices out there in the market with curved edges and metal body .... But the sharp edges make it a bit hard to hold as well . The colour combinations are refreshing from usual white,black,silver,gold ones. You can't take eyes off it . It has got a great matte feel all over it as well!1.where internet speed are not mind blowing...... is 100GB cloud worth?Sometimes yes, if you haven't used an app which is less than 50mb then even if the Robin backs it up to the cloud , it gets backed up easily and as the file is pretty small you can download it back fast, BUT if the app is greater than 200mb it will take great time to upload as well as download.So if you have a blazing internet provider it won't be that of a problem !!2.SoundI got the phone with Android 6.0 and I listened to music in dual front speaker , the max volume was bit low compared to after Android 6.0.1 update but clarity was decent for the songs .But After the update the volume was great but sound was very distorted in many songs but performed ok in other.Obviously this is software glitch and can be worked out.The dual speakers are also very immersive while in games and watching videos!!!3. Camera13mp back and 5 mp front may look great in paper but as of my opinion it does okay work .There were shutter lag( time between click and photo shoot) and it took bit time for opening the app before Android 6.0.1 update, Well that was fixed.4.DisplayTruth be told I liked the 1080p display. The pixel density is great enough to give nice display. And there are some great wallpapers to make use of it.5.SoftwareIf you are an iOS user (as I was) the missing app drawer won't be that of a problem for you. But if you are a stock android user then it may a bit awkward at first. It also has dedicated pinch out gesture for widget drawer which is great.Everything in Robin unlike stoke android is translucent at back(like iOS )Eg: if something popsup the background will be translucent and also the notification bar is TRANSLUCENT which I kinda like !!!!!I didn't experience any glitches as of now except immediately after startup using apps.5.FingerPrint sensorMostly on all smartphones finger print is on front or back whereas Robin has it ON THE SIDE. I have been worried about the surface area of finger that comes in contact with the sensor due to its positioning and the phone being 7mm thinBUT the fingerprint PERFORMED WELL in most of the case , Only 1-2 wrong attempts for me as of now which is a great result and also it is FAST. It is very handy to have it in the power button.MODT OF THE PROBLEMS FACED BY ROBIN CAN BE CORRECTED BUT SPFTWARE UPDATES , and as Nextbit is a new company they obviously will require more time.",2016年6月7日 在美国审核

Part of the reason to the switch was Apple's incessant nagging to upgrade my iCloud storage. The amount of free storage they provided was minimal to begin with and while the first few emails and notification popups were fine, after a while it became annoying and I knew this terrible business practice will be a consistent theme for Apple in the future.A friend recommended me the Nextbit Robin knowing that I am a power user and like to root my phones and also hearing me gripe about iCloud. Everything on paper made sense in terms of the software feature; Nextbit's smart storage is exactly what I was looking for since the only camera I carry around is my phone and music is a huge part of my life. I no longer have to worry about running out of storage and shelling out more money.However, what really won me over with the phone is not the software, but the hardware. The design is exquisite and the build quality is exception compared to more other Android phones at this price point. Apple's iPhone has always had a leg up imo because of its design, but the Robin to me is now one of the best looking phones out in the market. I also found that the battery lasted all day and the camera is fast and images looked great.TLDR: If you never want to worry about storage again and want to have the coolest looking phone among your friends, get the Nextbit Robin.",2016年4月28日 在美国审核

1 Star is too many. As a Consumer there is NEVER a reason you should purchase this phone. (If you work at Google Test sure),"As an Android Developer I have one of almost every phone on the market. I tend to get phones that have ""weird"" or unique features so that I can make sure that software supports those features, or that at least doesn't break it.<br>This phone's ""Feature"" is 100G of cloud storage.If you are an Amazon Prime member (which many of you are if you are shopping in this section) you get unlimited Photos and Videos for free with Amazon Cloud Storage. Use that instead.The data cost of accessing the storage however is so astronomical that a MicroSD card is cheap.Android now supports having the MicroSD appears as part of the same storage as the in phone storage, so for about $30 you can add 128GB of memory. Accessing your online storage which is slower is way, way more expensive.There is a bit of something to having your media backed up, but Amazon CloudDrive will back up all your media for $10 a year if you aren't an amazon prime member.This phone is slow, with horrible battery life, and ugly screen, bad build quality, intermittent freezes, and several apps won't run on it because of the funky ""shim"" they use to make the online storage appear local.If you buy this phone to be your phone, not a developer device you will be sad. If you buy it to be a developer device you won't use the features, you will just be annoyed at trying to have them not break your app.Edit:After Nexbit had all 5 of its employees downvote this review to try to bury it, and after their ""helpful"" note about coming to their forums for help, I thought I should make it clear how support for Nextbit works.""Dear user, I'm sorry you hate our phone, we don't give refunds, but we are working hard to make the phone suck less, and if you follow this really complex set of instruction, run linux, and don't mind that you could brick your phone we'd be happy to walk you through something that won't fix the issue you are having.""I paraphrase, but not that much.If you weren't dumb enough to buy an Amazon Fire Phone, you shouldn't fall for this phone which is much, much worse, and far more expensive.For the same price you could get a much nicer phone, and a 100 Gig MicroSD card.As a Consumer there is NEVER a reason you should purchase this phone.</br>",2016年5月21日 在美国审核

This caused a permanent bubble when installing it. Bubbles under screen protectors are a big deal for us. They are an annoyance that we see multiple times each day so we talked with support to get a replacement. No dice. Per Dusty E, since the plastic films had been removed from the screen protector there was no way for them to know if I was lying or not so they would not assist me.She liked the phone. Now, however, we won't deal with Nextbit anymore. What if there had been a defect in the phone? Would they have told us it could be our fault and not replaced it? Think hard before you buy this phone.",2016年5月4日 在美国审核

"It came packaged great, with a case","I am extremely impressed with this phone! It came packaged great, with a case, screen protector, earphones and charging cable with a plug. It really a beautifully designed phone, its pleasing to the eye. It took a bit to get use to the power button on the side but now i actually prefer it there. It runs just as well as an expensive phone, no lag no issues. It does only have 8gb of memory and the system takes up 4gb, so keep that in mind but with my sd card i haven't had any memory issues.

4.3/5 Stars Review and comparison to Galaxy s6,"I really love this phone! I previously had 2 Samsung Galaxy s6 phones that broke under ridiculous circumstances, and I simply can't afford another Galaxy, which I didn't like that much anyway. Didn't want to buy another Samsung, hate iPhone, and wanted something cheap, 4G, and smart enough to handle email, apps, and internet. I got my Blu Advance 5.0 HD yesterday, and I really love it, especially for the price (I can't believe how good it is for the price). It's kind of like a generic brand of samsung. It's a very similar setup, and I customized it to look exactly the same. Not quite as HQ as the galaxy s6 though. **I am giving this review as someone who bought a $70 phone thinking it would suck, but work just enough. If you want state of the art phone technology with HD, HQ, crisp vids/pics, etc., then you know what you have to pay for it.Differences:-8MP camera isn't that great, but isn't bad. 5MP front cam not that great either.-Battery drains fairly quickly, but I'm still using it a lot to setup the phone. (my galaxy needed to be charged twice daily anyway, so no big difference)-HATE the charging port being on top.-Not as fast at running apps and internet, but not unbearable if you've just been working with an old 3G phone until the replacement came (BB Torch)-Not as high def, but still works with 720p on YouTube. Looks good to me.-LOW STORAGE... but I knew that when I bought it. Purchased SD card.-Dual SIM, which is a nice option, imho.I really expected a much cheaper phone than what I got, but I'm very impressed with this phone, which is why I'm rating it so highly.I would buy six of these rather than replace another Galaxy or buy iPhone (I AM aware that there are other options out there). My friends aren't much for reviews and are mostly all iPhone only, so I had to research this, and I'm glad this is what I got. They have more HD phones on the market that are newer, and I would buy those if I had more money. (BLU Pure XR seems to be the compatible one with newer smartphones).I'll update this if anything changes. I'm actively looking for negative viewpoints, but so far, I'm just impressed.",2017年9月6日 在美国审核
Don't Buy this phone.,"I received this phone and it worked beautifully for a while.The, having only 32gb of internal memory, I couldn't download anything.I couldn't even take a picture.So, I went and got a 32gb SD card.Low and behold, the phone would not recognize the SD card.It would ask me if I wanted to save my data to the SD card, but it would only flip back over to internal storage and tell me I did not have enough space.I can not even download updates.When I received the phone, I couldn't download any apps.It said not enough space. I gave it directions to put it on the SD card, but no go.It would not even recognize the card.I have been fooling with this phone since May.Trying to find out what is wrong with it, if it was something I was doing.I even read the manual online, that didn't help anything.

I've decided they are borderline useless: badly underprovisioned (constant memory shortages),"I bought three of these phones to run continuous integration testing on some of our software. When I dropped my Note 4, I decided to use one of these BLU phones in a pinch as they seemed functional enough. After 3+ weeks, I've decided they are borderline useless: badly underprovisioned (constant memory shortages), bluetooth routinely cuts out, wireless is spotty, GPS spends most of trip trying to get a signal or the latency is so bad you have use the step-by-step instructions vs real time navigation.I would have tolerated all those shortcomings (it is a ~$100 phone after all) if it weren't for the malware, which I am increasingly convinced is at the firmware level (do a search on Chinese hacks of low end Android phones).Get a refurbished Note 4.

"Good basic phone, don't over estimate what it will do...","First off, don't forget what this phone cost. As a backup or temp phone it's great. Typical fashion with blue it comes with extras, screen protector installed, plus another in the box, case, earphones, power brick and cable.In unlocked phone/Blu fashion, it has a dual sim setup. Work number / personal number setup, instead of carrying two phones around.I like the FM radio it comes with... Such a simple addition why don't $700 phones include it?I like the lack of bloatware preinstalled, I will put the software I want on it thank you very much.Even though it is a cheap $$ phone, it doesn't seem cheap. I've held more expensive phones that felt cheaper.This a transitional phone for me, I don't feel like I wasted money on it...If you are looking to buy a cheap phone to play games you know won't work on a phone at this level, why try? I've dealt with people who need a $2000 computer and try to buy the $100 one to do what they need. They are upset when it doesn't and then badmouth the computer for not working.

For 60$ not too shabby (for an occassional user),"We wanted the 8GB storage/1GB memory model (Advance 5.0 HD), but ordered this one by mistake. Since it was only 60 bucks, decided to keep it. Yeah, storage is a problem. After installing only Opera Mini, Advanced Task Manager, CCleaner, ES File Explorer, Network Monitor Mini, HD Widgets, Hulu, Netflix, Youtube, DLS 2016, VLC and Simcity Buildit, there's only 500-600mb left on the internal storage. The phone does offer transfer of apps to the MicroSD card but, as other people have mentioned, it does not transfer entire applications onto the SD card, but rather does it partially. Don't understand why BLU went with that option, but I guess something is better than nothing.Screen is ok, but lacks brightness in (direct) sunlight. Phone itself feels pretty sturdy and quite surprisingly well built, having in mind its price of mere 60 dollars. Haven't really tested the dual SIM capabilites, but the SD card slot works great with a SanDisk - Ultra PLUS 64GB microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card card. Battery life on standby is really good. With casual gaming/video streaming and a few phonecalls here-and-there battery holds a decent charge, at least ours does. Wish it came with a smaller screensize, since 5 inch screens are neither here, nor there. Too small for gaming, too big for single-hand use IMHO. Although it has only 768mb of RAM, there's always 200-300mb left free (but that depends on how many applications you install and use).Charge wise, it takes some time to charge it, so no Quickcharge or anything like that. It ships with Android 5.1 which is ok, I guess. No current OS updates from BLU. Android Security Patch Level is a bit more disturbing, since it dates way back to 12-1-2015. Wish BLU updated it (if possible). OS experience is pretty stock, no bloatware whatsoever. Tried a few different launchers and finally decided to go with Apex Launcher which works great. Camera and speakers need no reviewing since they are not great at all, but for 60 dollars you can't expect stellar photos and thumping sound. The back cover of the phone is textured, but over time it has developed a small tint, probably from dirt and stuff. Also, the back cover has started to squeek near the edges after being removed a dozen or so times. It does fit, no problems there, but it feels as if the plastic itself has been streched or something. Not a biggie, but worth mentioning.So, with all that being said: it's more than an ok phone if your expectations and demands aren't too high.",2017年6月29日 在美国审核

Highly Recommend,"Arrived in one day.My daughter was so excited.We had to look for YouTube videos to figure out how to remove the back.(There is a little notch at the top to pry the back off.)We are letting our daughter use it without phone service and only occasional Internet access.So, I can't comment on how well it works as a phone.Even not as a phone, she loves the camera, calendar, radio, flashlight, video player, music player, calculator, and so many more features that are on the Blu Advanced 5.0 HD.She wasn't sure she would like the gray, but it is a shiny purple-y gray and she just loves it.I loved how it came with a case, USB cord, plug for the electric outlet, and a screen protector for the front.All in all, I thought it was a good value.She had recently bought an MP3 player for about the same price and this can do so much more than her MP3 player.I highly recommend the BLU Advance 5.0 HD Unlocked phone.",2017年9月30日 在美国审核
"Good for the price, but...","1.Background Info:I've had this phone for 2 weeks and my opinion is rather mixed on it. I wanted a phone that was low priced and offered my basic wants for a phone (Whatapps, music, camera, notes, etc). Half of the reason I also bought this was to also try Pokemon Go. Other than those, I don't install any other apps on my phone (other than some exceptions) since I don't need them and I'm careful not to install anything that may use my phone's resources.2.""$60? Seems cheap. Is it good?""Yes. For $60, it is a good value, if you're willing to comprise with the phone's downfalls. It works quite well for what I need it to do, however depending on how you're going to use this phone, I highly recommend looking at higher priced options first.3.""I just want a cheap phone to play Miitomo/Pokemon Go. Can it do that?""Yes, however I can't quite recommend it for that, for now.Miitomo runs pretty good. Pokemon Go runs quite well but you'll have to restart the phone every once in a a while for maximum performance. The phone does gets hot playing Pokemon Go, sometimes it's pretty noticeable, some other times it's not. WARNING: Miitomo uses a HUGE amount of your phone's internal storage (700+ MB), AND YOU CANNOT MOVE IT TO YOUR SD CARD. It severely cripples the space of this phone and you will get ""Insufficent storage space"" errors if you try installing more apps. Pokemon Go and Miitomo are the only largest apps I have installed and I only have 150+ MB of internal space left. For Miitomo, it is REQUIRED that you get a phone that has larger internal memory than this. Pokemon Go is still quite buggy in it's current state performance of the app can be attributed to both the hardware and software. Pokemon Go is indeed a battery drainer. On full charge, you will get 3-4 hours of continuous play before the phone goes into battery saver mode.UPDATE 10/05/2016: POKEMON GO NO LONGER WORKS FOR ME. I don't know why :(Pros: * Really well designed. The back has a nice leather feel, the buttons feel really nice and front is clean and simple. * Unlocked and ready to be used with any phone carrier (works with Digicel, my mobile phone network provider). * Price. Perfect for anyone who doesn't want to spend $150+ on a new phone and just want the basic necessities. * Display screen is bright and gorgeous, especially with the Lollipop 5.1 OS. * Performs very well and runs smoothly. * I was expecting the 768 of RAM to affect the device, but it doesn't even need to use 50% of the physical memory (idle), that's as long as you pay attention to what you're installing that would eat the phone's resources.Cons: * Camera quality is unacceptable. 5MP back camera, 2MP front camera isn't bad for any mobile device but my old blackberry takes better photos. Heck, my old Nokia C2 has a 3.2 MP camera and takes better quality pictures (I would even still use it today too for any photography). Even in front of a light source, pics are average at best. The camera lacks proper 'focusing' for images.This would be quite the dealbreaker to me if I knew before hand. I suggest spending more if photography is your thing. * Battery isn't bad actually, if you're like me and only use your phone most of the time to only answer calls/texts and probably game a bit, it will at the very least last you the day. If you're a heavy phone user however, you should note that the battery life may inconvenience you, unless you don't mind having to charge it on the go. * Very little internal space. Like a 1GB of space you can actually use. It wouldn't be so bad if games today didn't use hundreds of megabytes for data (that can't be transferred to the SD card), making this phone for gaming not a good option.(Minor) Cons: * No earphones. Every phone I've bought came with some...until now. Not much of an inconvenience if you don't use the earphones that come with your phone anyway. * It does get noticeable ""warm"" when you use more intensive applications.I've attached a photo of a side by side comparison of the phone's camera against my old Nokia C2 phone.",2016年9月10日 在美国审核
Loving it so far...,"This is so much better than my last phone. I can actually text without a stylus because the keyboard is large enough! I mostly use my phone for talk and text with the occasional use of data, so I'm not going to have to worry about running out of app memory. The main camera takes great pictures. At $60.00 you can safely forgo the expense of a case, and tempered glass screen protector (though I did get a cheap one to reduce finger smudges) If this phone breaks after a year or two, you can afford to replace it, and will probably be ready for an upgrade to the newest version anyway. I ran the recommended update with no problems. I really like the features of Android 5.0, and now that my Fire HD OS has updated to 5.0 (basically a modified version of lollipop) I am fairly current on the two devices I use the most. This phone is an excellent value for the price. No problems at all so far, Big enough to use, but still fits in my pocket, and I was able to use my standard PureTalk SIM card. Fantastic battery life with Wifi/Bluetooth turned off, and screen brightness dialed down.Update as of 9/22/2016 after 2 android lollipop updates, I am happy to report that the phone is still working well with no problems encountered.

Useful for anyone,"This was my first phone i ever bought, and got this because it was cheap and easy to practice with. I happened to go through 2 during my learning because the screen shattered the first time. The second time I got a case from another seller and that kept it from damaging. This phone has little storage but its fixable with a SIM card. The camera quality was decent, for the price its almost like an android phone from the early 2000s. But the screen was big and clear, the audio was perfect and the phone was easy to clean. The textured back covering was the best part, it gives better grips than those slippery metal phones. It takes android chargers but a few years after using it, it decided to stop taking the charge. Ive moved on to other phones since then, but its nice to remember the good security features this had, and the easy touch censors and big screen were good for gaming apps.

Not a bad phone overall,"I got the Advance 5.5 HD after my Vivo XL2.I like the lighter weight of the Advance 5.5 versus the Vivo XL2. I like the fact that there are 2 actual sim card slots and on SD card slot versus only one sim card slot to use if you utilize the SD card space on the Vivo XL2.This makes traveling internationally nice because you don't have to constantly swap sim cards.My only dislike for the Advance 5.5 is the difficulty in opening the backing. There wasn't instructions so I had to Google it. Then wished I had a guitar pick. Would have been nice if they had included this in the box. It took a while using my nails, but I got it off.And I just ordered another case for this since you can see the photo below, the top and side is warped and is not fitting the phone well.I didn't go through the complete spec when I purchased this phone.

I am a college student and the interface is easy to understand for all ages. The only down sides I've ran into is the device memory and microphone for voice communications. Device Memory is easily filled with apps and cached data, and this is easily fixed via a $10 32 gb mini-sd card. So in this regard, this phone is for the business aspect, not a gaming one. As for voice communications, I get a lot of ""I can barely hear you"" even with my mouth close to the mic. This is mostly due to a case I purchased for the phone, so be mindful when purchasing one.

"LOW QUALITY - NOT DURABLE.  Although ... Excellent memory options, plastic screen, low-quality earbuds","UPDATE.After less than two months, the phone speaker functions sporadically.The touch screen no longer responds reliably.Given this experience, I cannot recommend this phone.This is my third BLU smartphone.A Studio 5.0, and Studio 5.5.Each served me well, although both became erratic after about two years of use.Concerning the BLU Advance 5.0 HD negative reviews, especially those with claims of low memory, are countered by the youtube video provided by Cheap Tastic Tech.In this video, the version of Android provided on the smartphone (v.6.0) is demonstrated to provide a very powerful tool that expands system memory by up to 64 Gb, or lower pending the size of the installed SD card.Simply plugging in a high speed SD card ($12 item) and following user-friendly system configuration steps will expand system memory to levels beyond the needs of most users.I give this phone a 4-star rating because of the plastic screen - not because of restricted memory.It is important to position the screen protector as STEP ONE of setup.Unfortunately, I somehow scratched the screen during the process of placing and configuring the sims and SD card. If a high-speed SD card were included as part of the package (at least as a low-cost add-on item by Amazon), this purchase would easily become rated as five-star.Finally, I suggest that the distributor discard the exceptionally low-quality earbuds as they are of no real value and when used may very likely damage one's hearing.",2017年2月16日 在美国审核

All you need is a BLU phone,"Amazing phone for the price, I purchase it used and opened it and put my sim in and a memory microsd card and it booted right up and played all my favorite games with the newest Android system and features it's a rare find.Later I find that the camera is not zoomable...wish I would have known that. 5mp camera doesn't mean anything if there is not autofocus...digital zoom is outdated lol...but upon investigation it seems it could be a malfunction or just simply incapable of focusing physically with the lens.I played the newest games and it will play them. Maybe not as sharp as a phone that is especially built for gaming..but I have owned a ton of high end phones and was able to change to this one with no problems at all with the speed and capabilities of the Blu advance 5. Highly recommended. you should be buying all of your family andfriends this phone so they won't wast money with big named junk thats imported and up charged300 ~ 500%...stop this madness. I have blown literally thousands with Apple and Microsoft just to have outdated failed devices with no upgrade options. I'm totally done spending a whole paycheck ona stupid phone. You should be to if you try out this brand. I'm looking at a newer model right now. Ohh and the brightness thing. Be careful with the manual brightness controls. If you turn it all the way down and auto bright is not enabled..it may be blacked out. Auto bright function saved my phone I simply made the ""retina"" detect different lighting after accidentally throwing the brightness all the way down. Hence keep auto bright on when using the slider, Or use the ""settings"" widget and use the ""brightness toggle button"" and never touch the slider..atleast be very careful about the darkest setting. By luck my auto bright was on. Love the phone. Very cool BLU. PS. Nice outer aesthetically pleasing sleek look. Very light and thin.

Only 4GB of internal memory can be a problem,"Because the internal memory is 4GB, you can't fit many apps on -- not nearly as many as I use on a daily basis.So I bought a 64 GB Samsung memory card and installed it, but the phone insisted on steering new apps to internal storage, which was where the problem was.Some apps I could transfer onto the memory card, some not -- the process seemed random.I spent an hour on the phone with customer service, and she couldn't figure out a way to make the memory card the default destination for new apps; evidently the operating system is too primitive for that, and she had no upgrade to offer. Customer service had no chat room, and the customer service person, while very nice, could not gain remote access to my phone, and so could not really explore it.I had to describe again and again and again what I was seeing on my Settings screen, and since that was not what she thought should be there, we went around and around in circles.It was all very irritating.The pattern now seems to be that If I fiddle around inside of Storage, and add apps one or two at a time, I can coax them onto the memory card.And otherwise the phone works all right.But you should be aware that only having 4GB of internal memory can be a problem, even if you're not storing lots of media on the phone.I haven't even tried to do games, by the way.If that is important to you, I'd be wary.",2018年3月17日 在美国审核

Don't waste your money!!,"I bought this phone to take to China so I could have a phone while I was there.It was not my first choice, but my order got delayed so this was the only one that would get to me in time.I'm very sorry I wasted my money on this phone!!I thought 4 Gigs would be enough to put the basic apps I needed, a VPN (since China blocks Facebook and all things Google), Google maps, Google Translate, WeChat, Facebook, and Messenger.I was wrong, I could only fit 5 of the 6 apps (and of course could not delete the pre-installed apps that I had no use for).Adding a 32GB SD card was useless, as only two apps would transfer, and not fully, so I was never able to put messenger on this phone, which made it hard to keep in contact with my family in the States.Another problem with this phone is it only has 2g/3g capability (which I thought would be okay).Problem is I was on Edge the entire time, I don't know if it was a China thing or not, but 2g/3g were never available, it was either Edge, 4g/4g LTE (and this phone was not capable of the latter).So you can understand my frustration at the super slow internet connection.After adding an SD card I was able to use the phone to take pictures, but with messages coming in on WeChat I had to repeatedly wipe the memory to free up storage for new messages.The only thing this phone was useful for was making calls and texting, which did come in handy.Unfortunately I will be trashing this phone now that I'm back in the States and looking for a replacement for my next overseas adventure.",2017年6月13日 在美国审核

One HELL of a phone!,"The phone was a gift to a friend. I have to say he's very happy with it! Regarding the cellphone, it is beautiful.. Metal frame and beautiful color contrast... The screen is big enough for his needs, is very clear and smooth with vivid colors. Camera wise is good enough.. I mean, is not an iPhone 7 camera but it is really good in outdoors.. With low light you may struggle a bit but that's OK... The phone is fast, responsive and the battery life is really good... The speaker volume is decent. Really easy to set up and it came with everything u need... Screen protector, silicon cover and all accessories ... A really good phone for the price.. My friend is very happy with it..",2017年1月20日 在美国审核
Good for traveling,I can only speak to the quality of this phone for short-term use. I bought this phone to use while I was in Europe. It is a good phone overall and I wasn't looking for a top quality phone as I was only going to use it for about a month to keep in touch with my family. Im not sure I would buy this phone to use for a long period of time. The camera is poor but that is to be expected for the price and the battery life is rather short. I didn't have any other problems with it. The display is very nice and there were no glitches or problems connecting to wifi.,2017年5月21日 在美国审核
Update!! To previous review!!,"My phone was delivered 07/21/17, I purchased two phones one for myself and my husband. His was delivered 07/15/17. We both loved our phones until after to return window closed.First the window is not a 30 day window but that is minor compared to both our phones cutting off in the middle of a call,while surfing the web,anytime. I'm furious and we are both without phones that work. I should have listened to previous reviews!!",2017年8月18日 在美国审核
Absolutely love it!,Absolutely love it!!!!!!! I had a Samsung Galaxy prior to this one and I adored that phone. However I bought while I lived abroad and when I moved back to the US I was looking for something that gave the same flawless service but on a budget. I've did my research on my Amazon for over a month and this one was the first to caught my eye because of price and color !!!! Rosegold is a personal favorite. I finally committed to buy it and I dont regret it. The only 'flaw' per say is how to open it. Ive read just about every review on here on this phone and someone mentioned the dent at the top with mild force... Maybe Im weak but it actually required strong force to open it up but i managed to do it without affecting the phone. Other than that it's perfect. Would buy it again and again.,2016年12月21日 在美国审核
I love BLU,"I really like BLU smart phones. They just seem to be like most other phones for less out of pocket cash.Seriously I don't think I would like to pay a few hundred dollars when I know this phone is available. I'm not one to care what my phone's logo is as long as it does whatever I need it to do.I love the screen size, the clarity, I've dropped it several times and it doesn't skip a beat.",2017年7月4日 在美国审核
"Not happy,","Great phone for the price, But very far from perfect. Specs are amazing for the price still I'm Not happy, It was good at first. Great feel and specs Crazy good camera and screen, storage, sound. Then the hiccups, glitches, BT not always working right, until I upgraded to the newer Android and it got even worst. No BT, sudden restarts, crashing often More than once a day,I guess it depends on your needs. If you don't use much it might be OK.",2017年1月15日 在美国审核
Stupid amount of phone for that money,"First things first, I bought this phone for a very specific reason. I needed something temporary in between my old one breaking and a new one shipping out. This was never intended to be a forever phone.That being said, the phone performed fairly admirably.Pros:- decent battery life for all day use- Dual SIM- Expandable memory- Fairly stock Android, not a lot of bloatware- large screen- decent form factor- Price! Stupid amount of phone for that money.Cons:- dim screen- internal storage is abysmal for what apps want in this day and age. Even with just Google apps, I ran out of room right quick- ran into a boot loop problem twice in the month I used it. Had to factory reset to get it to work again.- Browsing the internet, switching between apps was slow and sometimes choppy.If I was in the same situation I was, I'd probably buy this phone again. Despite its failings, it served its purpose with just a couple hiccups.",2017年1月5日 在美国审核
Great phone.,"On to my second one, as they are cheaper to replace than repair. I dropped my first one, and ran it with a cracked screen for a while. The cracks were not even that bad. I waited until I had a method to carry it safely with an outfit who's pockets are unreliable. This is now my third BLU, my wife has the first. People often think they are much more expensive than they are.",2017年7月14日 在美国审核
Wasn't really happy with the storage space on this phone,"Wasn't really happy with the storage space on this phone. Ended up being too small for my daughter (She had another 4GB phone prior to this one, and yet the BLU wouldn't hold the same amount of apps; 4 apps shy actually).So we gave it as a gift to Grandma. Who is perfectly happy with it.But for teenagers who have to have tumblr, Facebook Messenger, Twitter and a game or two, I definitely do NOT recommend. There's better phones out there.",2017年3月6日 在美国审核
Not a bad phone,"TL;DR: Obscenely cheap smartphones have come a long way, but this phone still shows its price in places. I'd use this as a daily driver.Clarification: This review is for the /HD/ model. Specs for the base unit will be a bit lower.The Good: Don't be afraid of this phone's modest underhood specs. It's still capable of handling most common smartphone use cases.Browsing with Mobile Firefox, some Android games, texting, calling, picture taking, are all things I have tested and found rather pleasant.The rear firing speaker is surprisingly powerful and bass-y. Dare I say, sounds better than my Samsung S5!The 720p IPS LCD is another show-stealer. My past three phones have had AMOLED screens, and this phone's panel makes the return to LCD painless.The processor, RAM, and Flash memory are all ""acceptable"" for casual day-to-day use cases, and will tame most social media programs and web browsers without complaining.If its admittedly cramped 8GB of ROM isn't enough for you, drop a high performance SD card in it and enable Android 6.0's Seamless Storage feature. Boom. Major upgrade to your internal storage. (I have tested up to 32GB.)(WARNING: This feature will format and encrypt the memory card, locking it to that specific phone. ""Strange"" things can happen if the card and phone are separated while the feature's enabled, and the card will not work in anything else until reformatted normally.)Dual SIMs make travel painless, if not enjoyable.This phone supports UMTS Band 4, and works on T-Mobile.Build quality and button tactile feel was VERY remarkable for a phone at this price point. The back ""brushed"" panel really is aluminum. You can see contact points in the battery door, where the phone uses it as a conductive plane.They include a basic silicone cover and plastic screen protector right there in the box!The Bad:It's a cheap smartphone. I know I just praised its build quality, but it's imperfect. Mine's back cover will no longer ""latch"" closed all the way around.The touch screen is one painfully obvious place where they skimped to save on the BoM. The digitizer array is horrifyingly low resolution, with obvious ""steps"" when dragging or scrolling. It's still USABLE, but the low resolution can cause a few minor response issues when web browsing or playing games that demand touch precision.Power users will feel the pain of not having premium silicon under the hood.The Meh:Battery: It'll run all day on average use. Heavy users may find themselves reaching for a battery bank before the end of the day.Cameras: The main has 8MPs. You won't feel ashamed sharing its pictures with your Facebook friends, but it won't replace your dedicated point and shoot either. The app launches reasonably quickly. Pitting it against my battle-worn S5, the Blu actually launches slightly faster, but takes longer to close a focus lock. The secondary ... I don't take ""selfies"", but it'll do the job for video calls. My standards for front facing cameras are pretty low.Cellular: This phone is not equipped with an LTE radio - only UMTS HSPA+ 21Mb ""4G"". I don't consider this a deal breaker, because I doubt its modest specs could put the higher bitrate to use...The Ugly:This phone, among other inexpensive phones manufactured in China, were involved in a malware scandal. Afflicted phones shipped with a spyware trojan directly integrated into the over-the-air firmware update program.Blu, who produces some of the stricken phones, claims that all involved phones have had the trojan patched out of them.Google has released a statement demanding that these firmware spywares must be removed from all Android phones equipped with Google Play Store.Adups, who supplies the OTA firmware utility, released a statement that this trojan was never supposed to reach American market phones, and was intended as Chinese market research. Chinese market phones do not ship with Play Store due to censorship.Take from this what you will, and may your purchasing decision be well informed.",2016年11月29日 在美国审核

great phone with good price,"I bought it to replace my wife's Motorola G smartphone. She is very happy with it since it is not overloaded with a lot of bloatware, has a decent screen size and all the functions she needs to use.

Happy with this phone.,"This is my first time ordering a phone off the internet, and honestly i'm not disappointed. I was scared it wasn't going to be a good phone considering I saw a lot of bad reviews after I had already ordered it. and like most things people can buy online, its a 50/50 chance you're getting a good quality, or a bad quality item. But I would count myself lucky since this phone seems to be a good quality so far. I have not found any problems with it. It responds fast, and the whole GB is not much, but I did make a purchase on a more spacious SD card. which makes it even better.I so far have only found one thing that slightly bothered me,when I went onto YouTube sometimes the videos go green, and I had to re-enter the video to get it to be normal. Other than that though. this phone is a good phone for this price.",2016年10月15日 在美国审核
