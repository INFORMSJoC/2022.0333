"Great value, fast shipping, perfect buy.","From reading other reviews I was a bit hesitant. Comparing the S10 vs the S10+ I wasn't crazy about the larger size but upgrading from an older S8 it's not that much bigger. The larger battery did sound like a huge plus considering I had to charge my phone several times a day as a heavy user. A week into using the phone as usual at the end of the day the battery is near 40%. It's amazing as a heavy user to not have to charge the phone in the middle of the day.Pros: Price. Refurbished phone, I would never know it wasn't new except for the packaging. It did come with a fast charger and the sim card pin. No headphones. Battery life is AMAZING. Camera is solid. Bluetooth works great with all my devices, headphones, car, speakers etc. Wifi is solid. Cell coverage is good. Call quality is great.Cons: None so far. If I'm being hypercritical the packaging could have been a bit more protected and the sim pin could have been in a bag and not loose in the box and included factory headphones. BUT for the price I can buy headphones, I already have bluetooth headphones I use daily.Bottom line, phone looks new, works great. No complaints. I'm on AT&amp;T and had zero issues transferring to the new device.",2019年10月3日 在美国审核
Stolen goods!,"Phone is great. However, when I tried to add it to my sprint account,I was getting a message that said it was locked.I brought it to the Sprint store and they verify that they could not have it because it was assigned to another network. After a bit of research I discovered it was assigned AT&amp;T. It was then discovered that the phone was still their property as it was not paid off. Essentially what I bought was stolen from AT&amp;T not paid off and sold to another customer. Do not buy from this seller",2019年7月5日 在美国审核
Brick that takes lovely pictures,"I really wanted to be among the lucky ones who didn't have a problem with their phones but unfortunately that wasn't in the cards for me. I essentially received an S10+ brick that takes lovely pictures and videos. The colors really pop on the screen and the images don’t appear overly filtered. The slow mo feature is fantastic!I received it on a Friday and was pleasantly surprised to see it had no scratches or signs of previous use. Transferring data, apps, contacts etc from my old Galaxy S7 edge was a breeze thanks to smart switch. I tested everything and it all seemed to be working. Due to wifi calling, I didn't realize the phone wasn't connecting properly to my T-Mobile LTE network. It wasn't until during the weekend that I tried calling or texting away from home that it became apparent.An hour on the phone with T-Mobile customer service followed by 3 or 4 visits to the store failed to resolve it. What's weird is at the store it was working but as soon as I walked out the door, it would stop. It was connecting to an H network instead of LTE, but only in the T-Mobile store. This even baffled the associates.I have returned it and will consider replacing it with another S10+, and shall update my review at that time.************ UPDATE *************On November 20 I placed an order for a replacement with the seller 2019BestSale. Delivery was due on Nov 29 - Dec 2. When it didn’t arrive I emailed the seller and his response was to contact Amazon warehouse. He also stated he didn’t have my address in the system. This is weird because I have purchased a few hundred items over the years and not once has there been an address issue. I emailed him my address and a new date was set of Dec 9-12. That date came and went and still no phone. I contacted him again and his response again was to contact Amazon. A new date has been set of Dec 20 - 23. That's a full month from the order date! I went ahead and canceled it.My advice, STAY AWAY FROM 2019BESTSALE!!! He takes orders that he is either unwilling or unable to fulfill. He doesn’t set a specific delivery date. It is always a 3 day window and even then, he cannot produce the goods! Unfortunately this seller appears to be one of a few that offers the blue color that I want so I’ll just have to settle for black from a more reputable business.",2019年11月19日 在美国审核

"Friendship ended with Apple, now Samsung is my best friend.","I was an Apple user for since the iphone 5 and like most Apple users was heavily invested in their ecosystem.I ended up not being able to use my iphone and did not want to settle for a cheaper iphone due to financial constraints.Due to this I ended up looking elsewhere and really liked the idea that I could get a like new S10+ for half the cost of new so I took the plunge and I'm glad I did.I never was a big fan of android but Samsung's One UI is very user friendly and has almost 0 bugs compared to most Android offerings.The OLED displays that Samsung produces are next level, even when compared directly to the new iphone 11 Pro.It's so crisp and vibrant!Battery life is phenomenal as well.The company I went through, used-gadget, sent me a pristine S10+ that looked as though it had never even been used.Will certainly be sticking with Samsung for the near future and will also be buying refurbished from Amazon again.",2019年10月1日 在美国审核

Best Purchase EVER. I'd definitely buy again.,"The thought of getting a refurbished or ""renewed"" phone is always so nerve-wracking but with BuySpry, it didn't have to be! I purchased this phone on Sep 23rd, 2019 and had it arrive Sep 25th, 2019. Thank you Amazon Prime!<br>Disclaimer: I received NO compensation for this review. I decided to write this due to the lack of accurate or honest reviews in this section.If you'd like to check the status of your phone to make sure it isn't being financed, or stolen feel free to check out imei.info, dial *#06# and input the numbers that come up into the website. You'll get a detailed review on your phone! Mine came out clean thankfully!About the phone:This phone is indeed an international model, so don't expect to get Snapdragon. You'll be getting the international version, Exynos. Is it a significant difference? No, not at all. My phone did not come with any preinstalled bloatware which is amazing. It saved me a lot of uninstalling.Condition of the phone:You can clearly see from my photos that it is in pristine condition. I set a drawn wallpaper that I created to set out the color vibrancy and I love it! The screen has no scratches what so ever, though I'm not surprised due to the fact that this is gorilla glass we're dealing with here. The back of the case proved to be just as worthy of its pristine title as there were no scratches to be found, even under a magnifying glass!What's inside:BuySpry really takes the cake with their products. This product came in a generic box, bubble wrapped and upon powering it on it was partially charged, as it should be. It also came with a generic type-C cable and fast charging block. Included was also a SIM card pin for easy removal. BuySpry also included instructions on how to connect your phone and what to do if you find yourself having trouble.My Carrier:I'm on Metro by T-mobile and I had no problems at all. I called them up, followed their instructions as I inserted my SIM card. Once I was advised to power down the phone and turned it back on I can say that in less than a minute I was on my network with 100 percent flawless connectivity.Notes:I was extremely skeptical about buying this phone but BuySpry made me confident with the condition that I received my phone. I'm a working woman, constantly on the go and I rely on my phone for all of my business transactions and needs. The phone is flawless! The only thing that sets it apart from not having bought it from a flagship store is that it doesn't come with any of the goodies I would have gotten. Does it matter? Not at all. With the amount I saved buying from them leaves me with more than enough to buy those items on my own!Before leaving a review, please make sure that you contact the seller before writing a review. Negative reviews reflect badly upon the seller. I had messaged BuySpry with some questions as the phone was on its way and I was answered almost immediately. I would definitely buy from them again!!Thank you, BuySpry!</br>",2019年9月26日 在美国审核
Looks and works like a BRAND NEW phone for 1/2 the price,"It is indeed re-new-ed!!I cannot find a single scratch on the phone.Its literally BRAND NEW looking.We spent all evening yesterday taking and watching pictures on a holiday train and in a few hrs it will be 2 days since I charged the phone.I always buy refurbished products and believe they are better than a new product.Why?Simple.While a human spends a few seconds to make sure a mass produced product works, a refurbished product goes through much more rigorous testing and validation. But 'renewed' seems to be a whole different ball-game.10 years ago, the refurbished product I purchase would have some signs of wear.But it seems renewed products are tested, as well as made to look brand new.I literally paid 1/2 the price for a new product.Why would one buy a brand new product instead of this?Oh wait.I know.They probably want the shiny S10+ box right?because this one comes with a generic white box.lol.Happy shopping.",2019年12月22日 在美国审核
Contact Seller before purchasing,I bought this device from the seller OneTouchDeals. Was a little hesitant because the price was so low and the reviews I read. I emailed the seller upon our purchase to confirm in what I was ordering. They assured me that the device would work with T-Mobile and it does perfectly. Device is renewed but it seems brand new to me. I couldn't find A SINGLE SCRATCH on this device. The only giveaway that this is a used device is the box it came in. Other than that it seems like a brand new phone. For $498 I can't complain a single bit. Upgrading from a Galaxy S8+ and I absolutely love my new s10+!,2020年2月8日 在美国审核
A complete waste of time and money,The phone is labelled unlocked but when I tried setting up service with my provider (TMobile) I was told it couldn't be used due to the device being in bad financial standing. So I contact support and they ship me a replacement phone. All done right? Wrong. The replacement phone (which I was waiting to switch to as I was stuck using the faulty first phone) was ALSO in bad financial standing! Contacted support to se if I could get a replacement from anyone else and was told it has to be from the same people who sent out the first two duds in the first place! Not to mention I would have to wait to receive a refund until the previous two phones were received by them! So not only have I been out of a phone for a week I now have to wait on shipping to get a refund. Ridiculous that people can sell these phones under false pretenses.,2020年1月31日 在美国审核
Like new,"After reading some of the reviews I had fingers crossed that the phone would be in acceptable condition, and not turn out to be a stolen phone, which some have claimed. Needless worry. My device was in PRISTINE condition. Looks brand-new. Popped in my SIM card from my Moto G7 (Verizon) and it worked instantly. Using Samsung Smart Switch I wirelessly transferred data, contacts, apps, etc to my new S10+. All my apps were installed on my new phone very quickly. Some which required higher security (medical) needed to have me re-credentialed by the hospital IT dept, but that was relatively painless. I'm so glad to be back with a Samsung device. My 2 year experience with the Moto was dissatisfying. But I REFUSE to pay $1000 or more, or even $500 or more for a cell phone. With my computers and other devices I always stay a few steps behind the bleeding edge. This Amazon Renewed experience has been excellent so far.",2021年7月3日 在美国审核

Amazon Renewed purchase review,"I purchased this through Amazon's Renewed Store fully unlocked. I honestly can not believe how fantastic this phone is given it's a two years old flagship but looks and functions like it's a two months old flagship that was never opened. The innovation of Amazon to create such a huge marketplace for renewed devices to look and function like new with a three month warranty not only helps the environment, these renewed devices are a fraction of the price. It takes a lot to astound me, but this concept is a major major major win win for everyone. Amazon is truly amazing and its concepts are brilliant which is why Amazon is number one in customer centric satisfaction and retail creativity. I am absolutely thrilled with this magnificent still relevant phone, its brand new condition, 90 day warranty, and unbelievable price. I would never hesitate to recommend Amazon Renewed. I was hesitant, but I considered Amazon's policies and the 90 day warranty and purchased with confidence knowing I could return or exchange. You can buy without anxiety.

I called boost and they walked me through the prosess. Easy to do! Everything went great. I was concerned because of all the bad reviews. I think some people stop after the first try when someone gives them wrong information. I just needed to buy a $10 sim card and put it in then call and they turned it on.

Review: 10/10 (Cricket/AT&amp;T Network),"I was kind of scared to purchase this after reading the reviews, (the price difference also gave me pause, so if you're also side eyeing it I feel you.) but after my s8 took damage I took the plunge.☆Service: I am on the Cricket network (AT&amp;T) and everything works fine, I popped my sim in and experienced no interruption in service, to my relief. I also haven't recieved any slow downs with navigation/messages/ect. and I've been using this phone for a month and some change.☆Hardware: The phone itself is great. The camera takes amazing photos (2 cameras in the front, 3 in the back) and I really dig the Flamingo Pink aesthetic. When deliberating over this or the s20+ a big plus was that the s10+ still has its headphone jack. This means I don't have to worry too much if my headphones die on me in the middle of the day, I'll pack a spare and be done with it. The speakers are loud and clear (significantly if this is an upgrade from 2 or more phones ago) and messing with the audio functions (if you're into that) can produce even better sound quality. The infamous camera notch in the top right corner, while obvious at first, is barely visible once you've used the phone for a few minutes and rests comfortably in the notifications bar.☆Software: If you're already familiar with Samsung's flagships it's pretty user friendly and to the point, if you're coming over from the dark side of iPhone, (or other droids) this setup will take some getting used to. Dedicate a bit to learning the inner workings of your phone and maybe breeze through a youtube video to check out all the neat stuff it can do. The processor is fast and clean and the screen is vibrant and responsive.All in all I am very happy with my purchase and enjoy the device. I personally don't see myself upgrading for at least another 3 Galaxy's.",2020年4月17日 在美国审核
Absolutely great deal unless your on AT&amp;T Network,"Phone arrived on time and was as described, not a single scratch - just like new.The listing states the device will work on any US GSM carrier, and this is partially correct.This is the ""F"" variant of the S10+ and doesn't support Band 30, if you're on AT&amp;T you will likely notice decreased data speeds (no LTE+/5GE). You will especially notice the difference if you live in a major metro area where carrier aggregation is in place.If you're a T-Mobile customer you're fine. I normally get speeds between 20-50Mbps on AT&amp;T and with this device (missing Band 30) I get between 1-5Mbps.Great device, great deal, will probably return next week.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核
Best phone I've owned so far!,"I'm extremely happy with my purchase! This was a major upgrade for me upgrading from an iPhone Xr . I was seriously sick of iOS and missed my old experience on my Samsung S8 which broke and Ihad a deal on iPhone so was like ""why not.."" regretted that decision. Ever since they released the galaxy S10+ I've been earger to get my hands on it.The device I recieved was pre-packaged in a Amazon renewed unit box but seems to be BRAND NEW. You won't tell the difference if it was used, refurbished or open box new. The phone is incredible, extremely fast and snappy. Was extremely easy to setup too. Just signed into google account and instantly recovered my favorite layout and settings so it made the transition that much easier. The camera quality is fascinating. Beats the iPhones camera quality by miles. Can take low light photos very well and the 5 different cameras really make a photo taking experience that much better with so many different modes to play with. The battery life is extremely great! My iPhone would die in literally a half of my s10+ battery charge. And I tell ya, I really missed fast-charging! iPhone always took about 5 hours to charge. Which I hated so much. And it died so fast. While my new s10 I get a 10% to 100% fast charge in just a little over an hour. I couldn't be any happier honestly!Especially for the price! It's a steal!

GREAT service and quality.. not the item for me.,"I was fairly cautious buying a refurbished phone for the first time but I feel that the first thing I should put here is that I was VERY surprised by the quality received. The phone was nearly spotless and functioned with the snappy response you would want to see from a flagship phone (even a two year old one). As advertised it comes in a box that is not the factory direct one, (something that many reviewers seemed to somehow miss written 2-3 times in the description). All in all, the phone had a ""peely"" screen protector within a thick phone shaped bubble wrap ziploc, within a high quality phone box that sperated the peripherals (charging cable and sim pin) from the device and all of that was in a small sturdy ship box. I received the phone two days earlier than slated to but that is probably just because it was only from new Jersey to Connecticut. The phone powered on very quickly and stayed on for over 30mins on 1% charge before I plugged it in.Now to the only unfortunate part. I use a somewhat indy carrier whom I am pretty attached to called Republic Wireless. The galaxy s10+ IS compatible with them but ONLY the somewhat rare factory unlocked model (SM-G975UZKAXAA or SM-G975U1 when abbreviated in the phone's settings). This listing is for unlocked models NOT necessarily FACTORY unlocked models. So the unfortunate result was me receiving an unlocked model SM-G975UZKAVZW or the Verizon model. It's worth noting that more than 95% of you out there will not have an issue with this difference but for me this made the phone completely unusable.That leads me to the last part of my review and the reason I wanted to leave this review after my experience as a whole.On realizing that I had an unusable phone I was understandably disappointed and frustrated and reached out to both the seller (PromoDealz) and Amazon. Admittedly, seeing a name that sounds like a corner pawn shop (truly no offense guys, I'm not what the kids call hip..lol) I was a little worried about the follow up I'd receive but that anticipation, like the ones about a refurbished phone in general, was blown away. What I got was quick clear responses with nothing but the intent to try to help me out. After they had gone through their whole inventory to check for what I needed based on my messaged information they offered to extend contact to phone and we connected to discuss the problem. They didn't make me feel like I was being a hassle at all as they took all the information I could find on what phones work for me and checked their entire stock of s10+ (50ish pieces) then offered to receive their next shipment of 200+ pieces and check those too. These folks seem like good people who are dedicated providing a good service here. Hopefully they weren't cursing me behind my back lol. Wouldn't blame 'em.Unfortunately after the hunt they didn't come up with what I needed and, as they had offered as a worst case (or immediate if I'd preferred) solution all along we processed a return/refund. I somewhat assume that the carrier specific models of this phone are vastly more common because most people buying $800+ flagship phones are doing so because of incentives, financing and deals through larger carriers (""get a new family plan and get FOUR free* super flagship phones at only $300/month"" *phones free for first two months then at a monthly payment plan of $150/month for 97 months and a $700 plan cancellation fee applies when you find all the other plans out there for a quarter the cost.... Sorry I'm a bit biased against big carriers).Anyway, all in all, I'm shocked you're still reading this. I'm a lot less concerned about the refurbished concept after seeing the quality of the phone received as well as the quality of the seller's support and Amazon's backing. (Amazon support fellow actually said ""don't worry, we've got your back if you get any trouble from the seller"" luckily no trouble so I didn't have to call big brother)You still reading this?Why? Go read a book. Or like, listen to one or something.Terry Goodkind's sword of truth series has good audiobooks... On the road listening maybe?Too lame? Maybe go watch something on netflix or disney+?Falcon and Winter Soldier is not bad so far...Evil Genius was good for you true crime nuts..Seriously.I of all people am not that entertaining.At least go find yourself a phone.

Pleasantly Surprised,"I was very skeptical because of some of the negative reviews, but decided to see for myself given the great price (I always buy refurbished) and good return policy.This is a fully unlocked Galaxy 10+. Transitioning my SIM card and files from my old phone was a breeze.I found 1 very minor knick on an edge- it took effort to find the very tiny scratch. Definitely not a deal breaker, and honestly was very impressed with the asthetic condition of the phone. Cameras are prestine and free of marks, screen has no flaws, and the battery life seems good so far.Zero issues here- very satisfied with this purchase and feel like I got a fantastic deal.Again, I always buy refurbished and don’t expect complete perfection and original factory packaging. However I do expect the device to be of good quality at a reasonable price- and this delivered on that.If you're a skeptic and can live with a couple hairline scratches on the case, just go for it. You can always return if you're not satisfied, but based off my experience I would bet you'll be pleasantly surprised.",2021年2月17日 在美国审核
"Still a little Weary, but Feeling Mostly Good about CPRTX!","Ordered from CPRTX!!The phone was expected between May 17-20th, but it came today, May 15th! Very fast delivery from CPRTX!So far, what I can say about the phone is that the screen is perfect. I did notice very, very, veryyyyyy minor scratches on the back panel of the phone—however, I only noticed them because I specifically held a flashlight up to the phone to see if there were any (I noticed 3 really short, really thin scratches in total). Otherwise, they are not at all noticeable! The phone works like a brand new device, but my only con is that the charger I received from CPRTX makes the phone HOT, very hot, because it is not a Samsung-made charger. I will buy a legitimate charger instead (and I recommend other buyers do the same) because I don’t want to risk damaging the battery. Also, the phone has to perform individual updates a loooooot (it was originally released in 2019 and it is now 2021, so it is understandable), and as phones that have to go through a constant cycle would have it, it gets a little hot at times. I prefer to update my phone with it charging, but I can’t due to the charger problem that I stated earlier, so I’m going to give the battery life rating 2 stars. After 3 updates, the battery dropped from 73% to 68%, which isn’t bad! Otherwise, I’m feeling happy with my purchase. It’s only been a few hours so I will give a new update after 1 week, then another after 1 month!Thank you CPRTX! Please send 100% real Samsung chargers with the devices next time!",2021年5月15日 在美国审核

BAD PHONE BATTERY AND POOR QC,"Essentially, the S10+ had a battery problem from the get go. It had 18% battery charge when I received it, pretty normal. It took over 12 hours to charge. Normal charge time would be about 4 to 6 hours. The next day I usedit like my s8+, calls, texts, news etc. The heat coming off the phone was like a radiator, w no cover on yet. It used a full charge in less than 5 hours. Down to about 28% charge left. I went to the battery utility, it showed no excessive battery use. Obviously Ihad a bad battery, no replacement battery, they are permanent.I got an RMA FROM THE third party vendor. He said he would send another one. He said he had many in stock. He never did and played me for several days. Had to call AMAZON to back up the warranty.The phone itself was in perfect condition. Pristine indeed.

I brought because of the camera and it has not disappointed!!!! Wow and the fast charging is awesome!! And it's also a tough phone no screen protector have dropped it soo much not even a scratch but I am getting a screen protector though I don't wanna run out of luck lol but wow storage is incredible just like S9+ and I am with boost mobile all I had to do was call them switching it to my service provider was not hard. The only issue I have is it did glitch once and turned off but after a few moments it was like it never happened also the water detector after getting the charger a little wet the water detector caught it quickly and dried sooo much more faster then my galaxy s9+ it would take FOREVER to get the water out of my galaxy s9+ sometimes hrs NOT WITH THIS PHONE IT LITERALLY TAKES LIKE 2 OR 3 MINS!! And the speakers are sooo loud for a mini get together I didn't even need to hook it up to a speaker!! The only problem I did have is it glitch once turned off and turned back on a few times not sure if I dropped it without the gas a little too hard or it was self updatingidk but then it was like it never happened and it hasn't happened since I LOVE LOVE MY PHONE THANK YOU!!!,2020年7月1日 在美国审核

"Wow, what a deal! Believe the good review score and get the S10+.","This is the second of the two Amazon Renewed items I've bought, the other was a Galaxy Tab, that has lived up to the good review score and impressed me with its condition. I got the S10+ which is only $20 more than the base model and has a bigger screen and 17% bigger battery. It looks and feels brand new, the only exception being the slightest amount of wear around the charging port. The screen works perfectly, with no pixel issues.I'm very happy I decided to go with this formerly top-of-the-line 2019 model instead of the current versions. It looks and feels like a luxury item and the screen design stands out today against to the run-of-the-mill looking S20, 21, and 22 models (S22 Ultra excepted). I can't believe how smooth the front screen is. It's so smooth, in fact, that it begins to glide across any smooth surface that isn't level, so it may end up somewhere other than where you left it like the hard floor. Safer to put it backside down.The fingerprint reader is built in to the screen and thus invisible. I gave it 4 stars only because my previous phone has a dedicated reader on the back that is instant, and it's what I've become accustomed to. The reader on the S10 takes about half a second to register. It has a cool factor, though, in that it works even with the screen off.I gave the battery 4 stars because it was down to 75% after 1 day of light use which is a bit less than I had expected/hoped for. I feel like it got worse after I ran all the system updates vs how it behaved out of the box; I remember being surprised at how little the battery had gone down when doing all the app installations and settings. I have pretty poor cell reception though so it may be due to trying to constantly communicate with the cell tower. Also the battery screen says it's ""learning"" my usage habits so hopefully it will improve.That being said, these are minor sticking points compared to what you get, and overall its 4.5 - 5 stars for me. I doubt there is a phone anywhere near its specs and condition for the price, currently $220 for this formerly $1,000 phone.

FWIW I bought from Chubbies and got a SM-G975U1 with the Snapdragon 855 and it works with TMobile.Edit: surprisingly the display isn't set to the max possible 3040 x 1440 by default.

"Other reviews sketchy, but my phone works 100%","I was afraid it'd be reported as stolen when I'd try to activate it. Luckily, it's the real deal.The phone arrived in an unmarked box, and inside was the phone, a charging cord of roughly 3ft in length, and an off-brand charging brick. every part was wrapped in plastic. Upon initial examination, the screen glass was fresh, not a single mark could be seen, but the back glass had minor scratches, nothing to really freak out about. The metal bezel around the cameras had very minor scuffs and dings, but, again, nothing too serious. There were no cracks on any surface.This phone was powered on directly out of the box with about 90% charge left. No screen burns or afterimaging were visible. After setup, I tested each function. Cameras worked fine, fingerprint sensor worked as well. It took a charge. The accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, heartbeat sensor, compass, and GPS are perfectly functional.I had called my service provider to activate this phone. No issues with this phone were detected by them, and this phone is shown as fully unlocked and in good standing.All in all, this is a phenomenal phone, and it seems that I didn't get a stolen phone, contrary to the reviews I had read prior to purchasing.This review was typed on the phone purchased.",2021年7月16日 在美国审核

Works perfectly and looks brand new,"As I said in the headline, even though this is a used phone it works perfectly and looks brand new. Cosmetically, there is not a scratch or scuff anywhere on the phone. The screen is perfect.<br>The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the battery life. I purchased this phone because of all the reviews I had read and watched on YouTube. This phone was supposed to have one of the best battery lifes last year. When you purchase a “renewed” phone from Amazon if you purchase an iPhone one of the rules is that the phone must have an 80% battery life. However, Android phones don't have to meet that criterion. So until you get a phone there is no telling what the battery life is like. Like I said, I purchased this phone based on what I thought the battery life would be. Why not lease is OK it's actually know better than in old iPhone that I had before this. Renewed phones do have a 90 day guarantee so I could return the phone and try to get one with a better battery. But this phone does work perfectly otherwise. I had wanted to switch back from and Apple phone to an Android so I think I will just keep it. It's only a mild let down. The seller of the phone could have done exactly what I did, just download any one of 1,000,000 free battery applications and found out what the battery life is. It's just a little surprising because this phone has only been out for one year and the iPhone that this is replacing is 4 years old.</br>",2020年8月29日 在美国审核

Good phone to have,"Ordered the S10+ just a few weeks ago. Glad I ordered it from the seller I chose. Phone arrived in like new condition without a single scratch. Outperforms my older S model. The battery is good, charging is fast and it performs well. The one thing I hate is the garbage and bloatware preinstalled by both Google and Samsung. Useless trash that most people don't need. And yeah the new Android sucks and is the worst that Google ever released. Google just like Microsoft and many other tech companies release new editions of software platforms till they get to perfect and then instead of keeping it on the market for people to enjoy start releasing newer degradedAndroid versions with the newest being worse than the previous. And now the new Android is a f-d up piece of garbage. Google maps is the only thing that has improved. Everything else is thumb down. But the phone itself is good.",2022年6月13日 在美国审核

"Undated Review.  The 5-stars is for Wireless Dealz, not the phone.","It looks absolutely, without a single doubt, brand new! ...updated review. One month later.I've done EVERYTHING I can, took it to Tmobile and had them mess with tower selections and fast tower switching.This phone did everything GREAT...except make calls.It wouldn't hold onto a LTE tower for more than 10 minutes and NEVER could get on a 3G. Forget 4G, not once ever.Luckily, I held onto my S9+, which this was to replace. Just put my sim card back in it, turned it on and yep, I'm getting solid 4G connectivity with no drops.Unfortunate.I don't blame Wireless Dealz.This slip could have happened to anyone and it would be very difficult to detect until someone used it for a longer period of time.I'm sending the phone back RMA.AT LEAST they honor their word and gave me no trouble getting the RMA!Thank you.

Great for a refurb!,"I'm always nervous buying refurbished electronics. I've been screwed over in the past, and so I'm extra super careful.That being said, I took a huge risk ordering this device, only after looking through the different sellers and their ratings.I settled on one sold by Hybrid IT, and let me tell you! The device looked practically brand new! There were 2 small dings in the metal frame, but honestly, I didn't even notice them at first! The screen and back were pristine, not even a scuff, and all ports &amp; speakers worked perfectly!My phone carrier is MetroPCS/Metro by T-Mobile, so I did have to take my new phone in for a new sim/IMEI change ($20 activation fee in my area), but that was a short 5-10 minute process to get me up and running. I haven't had any service problems at all, which I know can happen with a used device, but all is good here.I've had the phone for about a month now, even going on a weekend trip to an anime convention, and it's held up very well.

More than happy with the S10+ (refurb.),"I ran my Samsung S7 Edge into the ground and after 4 years and 11 months, and the battery not lasting a day, I finally upgraded. For me, a phone is just a tool so my replacement simply needs to be quality, economical, with a good battery life. Having a phone with strong photo and video capability is also important and the technology has come a long way in 5 years. I am VERY happy with the S10+ and even refurbished, with regular use (but not an extreme gamer, video watcher, or teen-texter), the battery easily lasts more than a day. Typically, I just recharge every night but now, I don't even have to do that! It has all the features you'd want in a smartphone today, even though it's a 2-year old model. I'm still learning all of the features which will be fun, in time. Thankfully, the Smart Samsung transfer was seamless because just a half-day later, my S7 Edge completely died and will not reboot.

An absolute Steal for the Price While Helping to Reduce E-Waste. That's a Win/Win in My Opinion,"The phone is rgeat. The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and USE. Whather just checking your mail playing a game or using Google.docs, with 8GB of RAM and the Top SoC chip from 2019 at it's heart. Great pics, great video, and you absolutely will not find a better phone in the US under $600 USD, never mind the $200-$285 this typically sells for. It also has a headphone jack for one of the 35 sets of earbuds you've collected over the ages. Standard USB charging without the annoying port that Galaxy's normally have.The 1080p 90 FPS (?) widescreen allows for great video playback as well as gaming, which the afore mentioned SoC and the 8GB of RAM help immensely with. $1100 USD two years ago, less than $300 now, unlocked, works great with Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T, Mint, Straight Talk etc etc. The internal 128GB of memory is nice, as is the ability to drop in another $30 128 GB mini sdcard in if you're going to be recording a LOT of video without the ability to get to a PC or Laptop (Or just upload it to the cloud) for some reason. You an also carry around an extra cadrd or two if you want to record 10 hours at 4k for whatever reason.Voice quality is awesome, voice recognition is great, though you may want to keep it off for pricacy; it's just a kickass phone.It was also advertised as in ""Good Shape"" when irl, it was in ""New: condition save the battery which was at 95% available cells. Worth every penny, and if you have a kid, or you like to consume media and play games on your phone, besides an iPhone with it's unbelievable new SoC, this is right up there with any other current flagship (And it can play Fortnite along with numerous other gmes not on iOS for whatever reason). I could go on and on about the productivity, lack of Bloatware besides Knoxx Security and Bixby (It has Mcaffee but never, ever use that. Get the free version of Avast and Malwarebytes, or lol, anything but Mcafee or Norton's). You can also just wipe it and install whatever OS you like, though sticking with Android is advised do to drivers, but you do you, as it's great to tinker with and fantastic out of the box.Hope this review helped, and the seller get's an A double plus on this one.",2021年10月13日 在美国审核

Arrived in flawless condition. Magnificent phone.,"The phone arrived in flawless condition and only contained an extremely tiny little scratch next to the front camera lens.Watching videos on this giant Quad HD display is outstanding.The added telephoto and wide angle cameras make for very bright and beautiful colors allowing you to take many diffrent types of pictures.All SM-G975U1 models of the S10+ come with the Snapdragon 855 and are be factory unlocked. The 855 processor with 8gb of ram is still plenty in 2020. If you plan on having this for a while you might want to consider getting the upgraded storage, or buying a micro SD down the line.The phone still has the headphone jack, and 15w fast charger.My example came with a Samsung Adaptive Charge brick, and an unbranded 4ft black cable. The phone came cool to the touch in bubble wrap.The battery is 4100mah and has so far been plenty to last me through a heavy day of usage. As it is being bought renewed this can vary with each device as some may have been used more, therefore some batteries could be more degraded than others.But in the long run this phone is still amazing in 2020.

Excellent condition!,"So far it's EXACTLY as described. This is the first time I've bought refurbished, and I must say I'm impressed with the quality that I received and I'll probably end up buying refurbished for my next phone. I popped my AT&amp;T sim card in and memory card and it worked immediately. After a few updates and setups I was ready to go. The phone I received was factory unlocked like advertised. I seen a few reviews where they received carrier locked phones, but mine was unlocked. There was literally not a scratch on this phone. It came with a generic box that was sealed, came with new generic charger and cord (was not fast charging block though, but no big deal as I already had one). Speaking of charging, I was a bit worried when I first got it because the phone would start charging and then all of a sudden stop. I would wiggle the cord around and it would start working again, and then stop right after. I thought for sure I was going to have to send it back, and I didn't want to after it was perfect condition and unlocked. However I switched cords I was using and so far it hasn't done it yet, but it's only been a day. If I starts back, I'll have to send it back because what good is a phone if you can't charge it? I know it has wireless charging, but I paid for a phone to work completely and that's what I would want. Besides I don't even have a wireless charger, and wouldn't want to spend the extra money on it when it should charge by cord in the first place. Anyways I'm hoping it was just my cord, but it's weird it didn't do that on my other phone. I will update review later after I see how that goes and hope it's not the charging port going out. Battery life is so so, I mean it's probably expected for a refurbished phone I suppose. It does go down pretty quick, but I'm sure it's where I've been on it nonstop since I opened it too. Will update review later on over battery life too. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase! The seller I used was OlympicWireless I believe that's how it was spelled. Very satisfied SO far. The blue is very nice on this phone and I'm glad I got the blue instead of the black like I was originally going too.

I was very apprehensive, but in the end I'm 100% glad I did.I was shipped two items in a plain white box: a Galaxy S10+ phone and a charger.* The charger was an off-brand and it works just fine - just be aware that it's not a ""fast-charger"", so you might want to buy one à la carte.As far as the phone itself? AMAZING! I love it.** As far as quality it really did look brand new. There were literally no marks, dents, or even hairline scratches. I was super impressed actually. My package even shipped a day early, so that was sweet.Overall, I'd say don't be afraid to buy a used phone from this seller so long as it's backed by Amazon as ""Renewed"" - that's very important.

In the upper left corner, it now says ""Prefered System"" instead of Verizon, etc. I was able to get rid of the T-Mobile app by using ADB (four packages). The only bummer is that you cannot get rid of the T-Mobile start/finish logo with a very loud jingle!

It's important who you buy from.,"The most misleading part of reading these reviews is that most don't identify the seller. This review is mostly about the seller which was Hybrid IT.

The phone only had minor scratches on the top and bottom edges the screen was like new and back was very clean. I did have to use Odin to flash my providers firmware but after that all features including wifi calling which would not work with the firmware it was sent with. This is not really the sellers fault but something you should consider that you may have to do the same thing to get the full functionality out of it. Mine was flashed with AT&amp;T firmware but all are available from Samsung. I read many reviews that said it would not work with Xfinty which is not true with the right firmware.

In all other ways, it has been a dream come true for me, finally stepping into the twenty-first century from an old iPhone. It's wonderful to have tons of space on the phone, and the cameras take immeasurably better photos than my old iPhone (a 6). The real selling point of this phone for me was the sound, however. I love that it still has the 3.5 mm headphone jack. I use my phone more like an iPod or other music player, so the great sound from this phone was all I had hoped for. For those on a budget who want something that can last more than a few months, I highly recommend this refurbished phone.",2020年1月11日 在美国审核

Best value for the price,"My Galaxy S10 Plus arrived in near new condition. Upon expecting it there was only a extremely fine 8 mm long scratch on the bottom third of the screen, and impossible to see unless you are really looking for it.

At the end of each day I still have had around 60-70% battery remaining. I have not encountered any stutters or slowing performance whatsoever. The screen is beautiful and crisp, with no dead pixels. The cameras both front and rear take sharp images, and the focusing is quick and accurate.I also purchased a Galaxy Watch Active from Amazon Renewed and it is like new as well. I didn't want to spend $1000+ on a phone, and typically buy whatever looks like the best mid range phone for the price, with some good features, and others not so good.

You'll be surprised to get a great phone for a cheaper price,"I was skeptical about buying a phone online as you never know what to expect.

There were no scratches on the phone (I'm a perfectionist and like my phones without any damage) it also came with the original charger. Some people in previous comments mention there wasn't an original charger, but there was with mine. Also, others were concern with the phone carrier and if the phone is fully unlocked. I will like to say that the phone I received was described as fully unlocked and I also have AT&amp;T prepaid and the sim card corresponded to the phone perfectly.

Copying the sample IMEI that the seller gave to one person's question into Sprint's device checker showed compatibility. Also, it is a factory unlocked device (Unlocked by Samsung) - when you check on the ""Unlocked by Samsung"" website, you see that they state that the devices will work on all major U.S. networks - both GSM and CDMA! I received it yesterday and got it registered and activated today. Receiving calls, texts, and wifi calling all seem to operate as expected. Upon activation, the phone even downloaded some Sprint apps for account management and such. All is looking good.",2020年2月29日 在美国审核

"Great phone, worth saving your money!","At first I was skeptical of getting a used phone on the web but I'm happy I did, to save me some money. I love my phone, even though I have been so nutty going back and forth with trying out Samsung S10, S10 Note and now S10+. I love the ability to use wifi calling but wished texting was the same concept too. A lot of my texts takes a while since I have very little cellular bar. Cuz I live in an area, that has shotty cell service to all phone carriers. I'm happy with the memory of the phone and the sd expandable storage. The battery life get me through majority of my 12 hour work day. I'm not crazy about the finger scan lock screen, so most of the time I use the patern instead. And the speaker port on the bottom of the screen is poorly designed but okay. I like the option of a headphone jack. And this phone does everything I need a smartphone to do. I'mvery happy with my purchase.",2021年10月12日 在美国审核

How to keep your customers.,"I'll keep this honest.Buying an S10+ 1T, for $718.88 (half the price of a brand new one at $1499) is a lot of penny's to give up. I happily admit that I have no regrets doing so. I've been a Samsung customer since the S4, S6, S8 and now this.I was definitely sketched out purchasing a renewed phone from Amazon, as it was my first time doing so in general. Especially with a bunch of 1 star reviews claiming it's a scam and not unlocked. But I'm definitely impressed! The phone was delivered literally 2 days after purchasing, and it came with only a charger as an addition, no complaints there.Also I didn't have to change my carrier or anything booting it up, as the description indicates it's a Verizon unlocked phone. All I did was insert my sim card and expandable storage sd card in (only 1 slot space) and it connected right away to T-mobile without a hiccup.I'm content with this purchase.",2020年5月7日 在美国审核
"Best ""sweet spot"" at the moment","I never am a ""technology"" leader, having to have the lastest and greatest.I typically hang a few iterations back, as prices drop and the phones typically have bugs worked out and I've allowed other adopyers to pay the ""full price"".That said, I've recently decided to move on from my S8 Plus and purchase the S10. At a minimal outlay of cash, the improvements in the phone from the 8 to the 10 are easily warranting the upgrade. The camera improvements alone warrant the move.Very happy with the purchase. Several independent reviewers cited the S10 as the best phone of , and I'm inclined to agree.I didnt see a justification to jump up to the S20 just yet.",2021年1月22日 在美国审核

I'm so glad I got it, it doesn't look like it's ever been used. No cosmetic damages. It's been 5 days and everything thing has been a smooth transition from my old phone to this 1.Since it was unlocked all I had to do was put in tmobile sims card to get service didn't have to call and set up anything. I did checked imei code when I 1st got it bc I was told to do that before anything else and its clean.When I initially started set up the setting was in English but Australian not America but that was easy to change. I also had to change setting on conversions like °C to °F etc.The camera is clear and screen is smooth the curved edges don't bother me at all when I'm using the phone.I will definitely be buying from this company againin the future.",2019年11月10日 在美国审核

From not so good to excellent,"The first phone I ordered arrived well packaged cosmetically goodwith just a slight chip on the bottom left, to be expected from a used phone,not not a problem, especially when inside the case. The problem however was mobile network performance.Connection on T-Mobile was intermittent to non existentAfter a getting a new sim card twice, and a couple hours on the phone with t-mobile things were looking hopeful,but in the end network performance even witheven a a five bar signal was intermittent to non existent.Turning off and on mobile networks along with switching between airplane mode usually could establish a connection for a short time. My suspicion ended up being that this was not an actual t-mobile phone, as I once had very similar results with an unlocked Verizon phone on the T-mobile network. I returned the phone and a few days later the replacement had arrived.When I turned the replacement on I immediately noticed ed a difference.Unlike the original, at-mobile logo appeared with the familiar jingle.Needless to say the phone is working flawlessly and cosmetically better than expectedwith no visible blemishes at all.

Going to five star it for now.,"I'll update if I find any issues.So far, I've found none. However, if you are looking for a completely untouched phone, I suggest going new.This is a renewed phone. You may get one that's unscathed and looks pristine, you may get one that has dings and scratches on it. That is the price you're going to pay for going the cheaper, renewed route. The only thing that mattered to me was that the screen was flawless and it worked well. All I'm saying is make plans to cover any dings (and to protect your investment).Mine came with a bunch of little dings and scratches along the edges but I had already planned ahead of time on using a waterproof case that covers everything. The screen is in perfect condition, as well as the backing, and the phone runs like a dream. Even if the backing wasn't perfect, I was planning on covering it with a decal anyway.I am waiting for that decal to come in because the case I chose is hell to put on and take off. I know from my previous phone.It's a Lanhiem underwater case with a built-in screen protector and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a case that you don't plan on taking off for a while (and have a clear backing to show off the back of the phone/decals). I don't plan on going underwater with it either.Edit: SD card and Sim Card worked flawlessly. Got impatient and decided to start using the phone without the decal since my s9+ had that green tint screen issue that started to worsen.I'll come back if there's anything to report.

Amazon Renewed is where it's at!,"I must say I was very skeptical at first.I have heard unfortunate stories where people would go and buy a refurb phone and when they get it it comes and doesn't charge, has scratches, etc. What I didn't want to happen is to buy the phone, then it comes and turns out its bad and I have to return it. That's such a hassle and a waste of weeks with waiting for a refund or for them to send out a new one so I totally understand anyone reading this if they are hesitant. It took me 3 days to decide to take the risk. Anyways, I ordered a Galaxy S10+ from FiestaRenew (make sure you know who the seller is and check their seller page ratings as the quality of the refurb is based on this!) and when it came it was packaged nicely and came with a charger and SIM card slot opener. Unfortunately, the charging cable that came with it was bad and could not fast charge the phone so I used the USB-C charger I had from my previous phone and that worked perfectly. After further inspection of the hardware and testing of my mobile connection (I have T-Mobile) I confirmed that everything is working perfectly and as it should. Honestly, there is no point in buying a new S10+ if you can get a refurb one. If I handed someone my phone they would think it was new just bought.

Product Exactly as Described! Fast Shipping! Amazing Phone!,"Pros: Exactly as described<br>Fast ShippingGreat Phone at a great priceCons: None, it's a Galaxy S10+ that was exactly as described by the seller.I bought two of these Galaxy S10+ from CR Daily Deals - Amazon Renewed, one for my husband (upgrading from galaxy S5) and one for myself (upgrading from Galaxy S7 Edge). Both phones showed up a day earlier than originally projected, exactly as described.The phones are both beautiful, no scratches on the front or back glass, no scuff marks or scratches on any of the sides or corners. Both did come in completely uncharged, so expect to give it a full charging before starting your setup. They did not come with Samsung branded chargers as advertised, however the charger they did come with does not feel flimsy at all, and provided a very fast charge to the phone.Phone is fully GSM Unlocked as advertised, we both use Straight Talk and upon swapping sim cards from old phones to new the service was immediately active. There were two software updates available, easy to find through the phone settings, and both updates only took around 20 minutes.Cameras front and back work like new on both phones. All buttons seem to work. I chose not to rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition yet as I haven't used those features yet. I will update this if and when I do.Overall it's an amazing phone that showed up exactly as advertised. Looking at it laying here I wouldn't know it wasn't a new phone if I hadn't bought it renewed myself.

Seller shipped via FedEx.....many problems occurred with shipper. Missed delivery date (item was not delivered by end of day), FedEx didn't want to ship over the weekend with FedEx center less than 30 mins away.

"Great, almost perfect.","I saw more than a few mixed reviews for buying renewed. My seller for buying renewed was TradeMore Services. Happy to report that my experience has been great, with one small hiccup. Looks brand new without any scratches. Checked the battery capacity with an app called Accubattery and the battery is rated at 96%. Everything so far is working as it should.About the hiccup. The phone I received was a Verizon unlocked phone and my sim card worked but with a limitation at first. I could call, send/receive texts and had internet on my phone. However at first it was only limited to 3G data. I contacted the seller and they told me they were happy to refund me if the issue wasn't solvable and recommended double checking the settings. I Googled the issue and manually reset a few things on viola! The 4G LTE is now working on the phone.Overall very happy with the phone.",2020年9月24日 在美国审核
Like New Condition,"Amazon renewed is an outstanding program. The device arrived in like new condition. You could not distinguish the device externally from a new device. The only possible issue I have noticed is that the battery drains a little quicker than I expected. However it lasts much longer than my old iPhone and it charges much quicker than my old phone. It might just be the nature of smart phone batteries or it might be a slightly bad battery. But it is barely enough to notice and it lasts so much longer than my old iPhone, that I decided to keep the phone and not return it. I would recommend Amazon renewed to anyone.",2020年12月4日 在美国审核
Better than New!,I purchased 2 of the Samsung Galaxy S10+ Factory Unlocked Phones with 512GB for the price of 1 and I am COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this purchase. The phones arrived on time and without a blemish on either phone. I was able to transfer the SIM (Cricket Wireless) from our old phones and start using them immediately. We recently received the Android 10/One UI-2 OTA update from Samsung which added some additional features and increased battery life to 2 days (Dark Mode) between charge. I GIVE THEM FIVE STARS X 2,2019年12月27日 在美国审核
99.95 satisfied  and a good purchase,The only thing you need to know about this phone . Is that it dont come on any instructions is. The little key like pin that come with the phone. Is used to push in a hole in the top right corner of phone. Aproxmotly a inch and a quarter in. The slot for the sd card and sims card pops up. They both go on the slider.And you might wanna get a usb c cable. Mine was brand new with the phone.But didn't work. It also comes with a quick charger which works well.Besides that It is a brand new phone. With no scratches at all. And it was packed well and the delivery was real fast.

Great Phone. Great Deal.,"I would say this is more of a review on the renewed program rather than the S10+ overall.I was a little skeptical of ordering something refurbished, but with a $400 cheaper price tag than a new S10+, I had to try it out first. I ordered a Galaxy S10+ from FiestaRenew and so far everything has been great. The shipping was quick, according to Amazon, it was supposed to take about a week and a half, but I received it in just two days. It came in a generic box but the charging adapter and cable provided seems like genuine OEM parts. The device itself looks incredible. As far as I can tell, everything works as intended, the fingerprint sensor, the cameras, the display, the buttons and the charging port, the headphone jack, however I've yet to test the SD card reader. The battery still has 95% of the original capacity according to Accubattery, so much better than the 80% promised by the renewed program and it lasts me a full day easily.The only ""notable"" imperfection is a small hairline scratch on the bottom right of the back of the phone, which is no big deal. The only thing I'm not sure about is whether or not it still has the IP68 certification since it is refurbished.",2020年7月12日 在美国审核
Solid feel &amp; easy to use.,"It's a Samsung.This Galaxy phone is very fast with plenty of memory. I easily (and inexpensively) added another 256GB of memory. I save all my pictures, videos, and documents there. The phone allows me to use encryption to secure this data as well as secure the data on the internal memory.It also has a split-screen capability that is a game-changer, at least for me. Wow, what at difference it makes!It's slim, so it fits easily in the palm of my hand, but because it's a little taller than other phones, the pictures and videos look superb!It definitely is an excellent phone specially for its low cost.",2020年1月10日 在美国审核
BUYER BEWARE,"My previous review is below written when I received this item on October 14 2019.As noted in that review the phone came with a screen protector which effectively disabled the fingerprint sensor.I considered removing the screen protector until today, January 22 2020 when I removed it.It is then that I discovered that the real reason for the seller adding the screen protector.The screen below had deep scratches and chips hidden by the screen protector.The seller should list these defects - but they did not.I will see if Amazon will honor a replacement.-----Previous review October 2019Just received this yesterday as a replacement for my beloved but expired S6 Active.So far so good.It arrived in an Amazon renewed box with a charger that is not a Fast Charger - it just cable charges which is very slow - so discard the charger and just use your old fast charger or buy a new one.The phone looksnew with no visible defects - except one - whichappears to be caused by the screen protector that has been applied to the display screen.On the fingerprint sensor there is a quarter moon of what appears to be micro-bubbles from the glue of the protector - which I initially thought was an abrasion.This causes the sensor not to ""see"" a fingerprint.When attempting to set this up the Samsung software complains that the sensor is dirty.This S10 plus is an Australian with an Exynos processor which is used on Samsung phones in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, etc.The US phones use the Snapdragon processor which is supposed to have marginally better GPU performance.The phone (GSM) works perfectly on ATT's network and it was just a matter of contacting the provider to register the IME of the microcard with the new phone.Fortunately, most of my settings, Apps , Contacts, etc, were previously backed up to the Samsung Cloud so restoring them to the new phone was not difficult.I recommend remapping the Bixby key to open your preferred App and downloading and configuring Google Assistant which is superior, imho.The only irritation is the problem with the fingerprint sensor which I could possibly resolve by removing the screen protector.Otherwise - a good bargain. (Caveat -reviewed after only one day of use.)",2019年10月15日 在美国审核
Really good for value,"Thinking about it now, I almost gave up buying one of this because of some reviews here. But it was half of the price, so I went for it.Package arrive at the hotel, I ripped it open and there was the box. My fear was to open the box and find a somewhat damage phone. When I got it out of the box it even had the protector you need to pilled off from an original phone. I got it off and there was a brand new phone, with no scratch and for almost half of the price. It was so wonderful!!!Went to a trip to New York with my wife and we took so many pictures there. The phone really helped on capture that magical city. And so far I have no problems with it.

The battery life is so much better than my last phone so I have no complaints. I'm extremely happy. It also came with a thing to stick in the sim card holder to pull it out, before when buying refurbished phones they never do that so I end up having to use my earring so that was a major plus in my book.

Exceptional quality despite the sketchy reviews you see on these types of products.,"I have to say I was a little sketched out because their promised delivery date was 10 days out and I've seen reviews where instead of a smartphone, a burner flip phone was inside the case.I got it two days after I ordered. The packing was sturdy. There was definitely an S10+ in there.Now don't expect the original packaging, they print their own cardboard box in varying sizes for the different phones I imagine, which means you don't have to worry about cutting the box as you get into the package, if you'd like to save the box for display proposes.Onto the phone, it's wrapped in plastic and has a peel off cover on the front. Upon peeling it off... Amazing. Just a few tiny scratches, like the ones you'd get just from putting it in your pocket without a screen protector, only visible upon a scrutinizing glare against the light. No chips, dings, cracks, scratches on the back, nothing. Came halfway charged with a AC adapter and a type C cable, both Samsung and not third party.No major phone brand company logo on the boot screen. No bloatware. Stuck my SIM from Straight Talk in and it instantly worked. Twice the LTE speed that I got on my S7, more bands available to the S10+ I bet.Overall am I happy with the purchase? If you gave me a brand new one and then this one, the only difference would be some very, very light and tiny scratches on the screen, only seen with the screen off and directly in the light. Is that worth 300$? Absolutely! I'm amazed it's actually this good and refurbished. Totally satisfied.",2020年4月19日 在美国审核

"My Experience, Very Good!","I was hesitant on getting this, because I see all the reviews that have 1 star, 2 stars, saying their SIM Cards don't work, and the screen came cracked, and that it doesn't work right or isn't what they ordered. My experience, I got exactly what I ordered. I ordered a Black Samsung Galaxy S10+ Unlocked with 128GB of Internal Memory, and that is exactly what I got! It is an official Samsung Galaxy S10+ (NOT a Chinese knockoff, or a really convincing fake) and it works perfectly fine with my T-Mobile SIM Card, and everything works great (LTE, Calling/Texting, Wi-Fi Calling). All of the buttons work fine, my screen had no scratches or cracks (looked brand new), Fingerprint reader works perfectly (for me it works 98% of the time) and the screen looks amazing.I cannot personally guarantee that you will have the same experience if you order this product, but I can tell you, the product I received is a Genuine S10+, has the same specs as is listed in the title/description, and it works exactly the way the phone is supposed to (which to me, it works amazingly)",2019年11月28日 在美国审核

Fingerprint reader works great, but I find it a tad bit slower than the ones on the back, but I believe it's due to the technology of being integrated in the screen.Only weird thing I found is that sometimes when I try to listen to a Whatsapp audio on my ear it takes a bit of time to switch to the ear speaker and it keeps playing full volume. Not sure if that is a software or hardware issue, but nothing I can't live with.Overall I'm extremely satisfied for saving so much money and basically getting the same phone.PD: Honest review, wasn't paid or even asked to write a review on the phone. The company never contacted me for any follow-up after purchase.",2020年5月27日 在美国审核
Love the device,"I did my reviews on the device and I am pleased with performance.It is very similar and carried over all of my apps and almost all of my passwords.

"When they say unlocked they mean global whitelist,  price may mean it's us blacklisted","I thought this could possibly be too good to be true. Well, for a while it was as good as the price. But it was a blacklisted phone, a Verizon unpaid. I was on metropcs and had no issues but all major carriers here will not allow it. So not as advertised,but hey the phone was in decent condition. Returning this and going to Verizon to buy a new one outright, as should you if metro or boost isn't your cup of tea.",2019年10月10日 在美国审核
"Functional, Fast, and Accurate","I'm unsure what went wrong with some of the other reviews I've seen with complaints, but The item (S10+) arrived exactly as described in a plain box containing the phone, a charger, and a cable. Battery life seems to be just as it should be and while I was told there would be some minor blemishes, I honestly can't find them. Phone is legitimately unlocked, so setup consisted of putting in the SIM card and turning it on. Price was great and storage is ample. Basically, I got exactly what I asked for and it showed up a day earlier than advertised. Can't really complain about that.Item sold to me by ElectroWireless and I would recommend them to anyone",2021年8月9日 在美国审核
Samsung Renewed Galaxy S10 plus on Metro PCS,"The phone arrived a day early. No visible damage. I activated the phone thru Metro PCS service and it seemed liked everything worked great on the phone and I was able to use all of my apps. The signal kept dropping after a few minutes. After calling Metro and troubleshooting 3 times and bringing it to a store to have them test another sim card, it still didn't work. So I had to return it after keeping it for 2-3 days. I would gladly take a chance on another renewed phone. It could have been an issue with the internal antenna. The phone arrived at the shipper today and I'll see how long the refund process takes. No issues with the seller. 5/22 update: The seller acknowledged my return and processed my refund which takes about 2-3 business days. I would certainly purchase from this seller again, even though the phone didn't work for me. Rob from Chicago, IL",2020年5月20日 在美国审核

Hit or miss,Bought two phones from this seller for gifts.First one came packed in a protective casing. It had no visible scratches or defects. However the second phone came in a thin plastic wrap that provided no protection for shipping whatsoever. It also had many scruffs on the sides of the phone. This phone also Started overheating the moment we turned it on. On top of that there was so much dust built up in the charging port and mic jack that the charger would not insert easily.Giving this review a 3 star till I receive my refund then i will bump it up if there are no issues with the returns. I will also update if the first phone has any issues that were not seen right away****Update****Refund was issued in a professional manner. If I dont have any other issues with the first phone I will definitely buy again!,2020年12月7日 在美国审核

Great phone,The phone arrived in almost perfect condition and works smoothly. The battery life is pretty impressive for an avid user. Comes with generic charger and USB so I used my own samsung one.

Works With Verzion,"In the listing for the Variant ""Samsung Galaxy S10+, 128GB, Prism Blue - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"" it says it does not work with Verizon, but I did research on the model number of the S10 plus and it said it worked.

Like New! Better than expected!```,I have combed over the reviews for this seller/phone and decided to try my luck and buy a phone. I messaged the seller prior to purchase to ask if this phone would work on my Verizon prepaid account. The seller was prompt with a response and ensured me it would work fine. The phone came in the original S10+ box but the charger was not original. I did not receive any headphones but I'm ok with that. The phone did come with the sim card key which was great. The phone itself was in immaculate condition. it pretty much looks brand new! I put my sim card and 128G SD card in and everything worked perfectly with no issues. All my photos and apps ported over seamlessly. I'm upgrading form another Galaxy phn and I am very pleased with this phne! it crystal clear and takes great pics!,2020年7月13日 在美国审核

I ordered my phone on the 8th it arrived on the 11th...WAS scheduled to arrive between the 16th and the 24th. The only thing I did want was a blue, green or purple phone...but like I told my husband it doesn't matter that much because I'm getting a purple wallet case anyway!

Like a new phone,"UPDATE 2. Bought another S10+ from""Synergy"" as an Amazon Renewed. Went over it with a magnifying glass and could not find one scratch. I ran several battery tests that tested between 97% and 99% battery health. Synergy tested it at 98% and placed that information on the Box label. I'm getting approximately 2 days battery use after charging to 85% and recharging charging at approximately 20%. I've tested the phone microphone which was the reason for the return and it has been perfect. People I called or called me couldn'thear or understand me after about 1 minute. No problem even after several 2 hour Whatsapp calls to Brazil and numerous calls locally. Problem solved. Also very fast free shipping. SYNERGY,I'll do business with you again.UPDATE!! Returned the phone today. After around 1 minute of calling someone, they couldn't understand what I was saying. Happened on local calls, distance calls, Whatsapp and Messenger. Att had no solution. Mictest app showed very low voice levels but when put it on speaker phone people could hear me fine and Mictest levels were fine. On the positive side Amazon Return went perfect, basically no questions asked which I found strange. You'd think the seller would want to know what to fix. Oh well. I'll try one more time. I really like the phone. Blazing fast from what I'm used to and updated to Android 12.This is like a new phone except for the battery. Per Accubattery after 8 charges it has a device capacity of 81%. This is within Amazons requirement that it be no lower than 80%. It started at 55% then 53% then came up charge after charge to 81%. Took it to Phone Doctor for 59.99 battery replacement but am still happy with the purchase.",2022年2月7日 在美国审核

RE-CELL- BEST.CUSTOMER.SERVICE.EVER!,"Quick version:Phone condition is Like New. Seller, RE-CELL, is exemplary and quick to reply.Long version:Received phone with 2-day shipping and was near perfect except for what looked like a small smudge below the screen cameras. (Picture 1). Barely visible unless the light hit it at a certain angle. Because it was the screen I contacted the seller to see if this was normal. He apologized saying it was not acceptable and to return it and he’ll send another out and included a rebate for my inconvenience. He didn’t have another white, but a black. Thinking about the black, and looking at images, I was getting to think I might like the black better than the white. He contacted me saying he received a white one. I told him I’d rather have the black he had instead. He said it was sold, but he’ll source another black one for me. Which he did. Same day. At that point I realized he sourced a white one for me, and then a black one. Geesh. He sent the 2nd phone out once the return package was sent. So free return shipping, his exchange was sent FedEx 2-day to get it to me asap. He included a small wireless charger. Email responses were prompt.Phone looked Like New (Pictures 2-4). The seller checked that it would accept my carrier out of the box. And it did. I checked with CPU-Z app and verified this was the better regarded Snapdragon (7mm, USA/China), not the Exynos (8mm, International) that should sell at a lower price-point. After 2+ weeks with the phone the only way I can tell this was a used phone is the battery. Everything is working perfectly. I’ve just started checking the battery with 2 apps, but they differ. One is just above the Amazon 80+% at 81% (AccuBattery), the other is showing 71% (Battery Guru). More charges are needed to be more accurate, and AccuBattery is highly rated and reviewed. Nonetheless, way more than enough battery capacity to last me a day and still have 30-40% left, and the phone is 2 years old. So there's that.In short, anxiety about buying a used phone, especially if problems arise, are a non-issue with this seller, RE-CELL. I will be searching out this seller for the next phone for anyone in my family.I was very pleasantly surprised with their customer service and can recommend RE-CELL without reservation.",2021年12月6日 在美国审核

S10+ from Verizon using on Consumer Cellular (which uses ATT network),"OK. This was purchased from ""Prime W"". It was advertised as ""For AT&amp;T"" - so you can imagine my head just about blew up when I powered it up and the Verizon logo popped up. (Verizon phones are generally CDMA phones and AT&amp;T are generally GSM phones), since the description of the phone did not indicate this phone had a dual SIM capability, I assumed I was going to have to go through the return process to get a phone that would be compatible with Consumer Cellular's AT&amp;T network requirement. Lo and behold - the phone was compatible with Consumer Cellular. Usually, kismet in my favor in these matters is not in my favor. This time, God's finger reached down and touched me.The phone itself came in pristine condition. Only a consideration when you're buying a ""renewed"" phone. Prime W not only included a genuine Samsung fast charger, but they also put a cellophane static cling screen protector for shipping on AND shrink wrapped the phone. Good on you Prime W. The charging port appeared unused - usually a good indicator of how the phone was used by the previous owner. For all intents and purposes, this was a new phone - which is important because the phone is now my wife's.The only issue I've encountered is the inability to remove a phone alert that I've inserted a non-Verizon SI"" card into the phone. With this phone, I spent some time with Consumer Cellular's customer service department, but after some nudging they were able to get it in service.The phone immediately updated to Android 11 and the most recent Google security patches. The Samsung Smart Switch accommodated the transfer of files from her S7 and Google did the rest. Since my wife never deletes anything - I added an additional 128G SD card and she's off and running.Samsung's S10+ is the same phone as the S10 except the screen is .3"" larger than my S10 but I didn't find it unwieldy - and she likes the larger screen, but it's not like some of these phones where you find yourself suddenly carrying a ""notebook"" around. Women carry their phones in purses -- men generally in their pocket. So, for her it's the cat's 'jammies.As with any phone that you're using out of the original network, it came jammed with Verizon bloatware which can't be removed but can be deactivated. It'll just sit there wasting memory but by-and-large isn't an issue. Many apps can be moved and stored on the SD card freeing up phone resources - unfortunately useless Google and Verizon proprietary software are largely permanent squatters on your phone.Plus, this phone is compatible with all of my wireless Anker chargers so that's nice - but the Samsung fast charger wall plug adapter is really quite impressive. Just saying.I'm not a ""Samsung guy"" because I got used to and spoiled by LG until they decided to get out of the phone business and I had to switch phones to get on to Consumer Cellular but this phone, like my S10 is really something. The cameras are vastly superior - I mean, the difference between these phones and my old LG is the difference between lightning and lightning bug - not even a close comparison.On the same note, the audio is just kinda ... WOW! Understand that I'm not a kid, I'm a tail-end boomer and proud of it, when I'm listening to my music or watching video, I'm not using buds ... I'm using full blown Bose noise blocking headphones. I've got to say that I didn't know what I was missing all these years. Really quite impressive.Now understand that this phone does have a 3.5 headphone plug which is nice ... but it also has a dedicated Bixby button right below the volume buttons on the left - so even deactivated, Bixby will be a recurring irritant ... like a bad, bad laxative. Come on Samsung ... dump that P.O.S. :o)Anyway, very, very nice phone - props to Prime W -- for a bunch of ""East Coasters"", you folks are aces in my book.",2021年10月9日 在美国审核

Looks and works like brand new!,"Received the phone and charger professionally packaged. I unpacked expecting to see maybe a scratch or 2 but to my surprise this phone is flawless!! I wouldn't have expected anything less if it were brand new. I purchased the unlocked phone that was previously a Verizon phone since I have service with Verizon.I was told I could just take the sim card from. My old phone and place it in theis one but when I did my sim was not recognized. Verizon was closed so I proceeded to transfer my info from. My old phone to this one. After a few taps and some added info all my stuff wirelessly transfered with not so much as a hiccup! Wow! Something works like they say it does!! The next morning I took the phone to Verizon and they installed a new sim and I was up and running!! The only negative I see is how out-of-date the android system is. This thing has been prompting me to install updates for 3 days now.I called Samsung and they said if the phone hasn't been updated in a while then yeah, there have been a lot of improvements to Android over the last 2 years. Normally an up-to-date phone will update in the background when you're sleeping or the phone is on idle unless you have turned it off and you can only do that while in developer mode. All I really heard was blah blah blah update, blah blah blah, developer mode.. so I will let it do what it has to do.All in all I couldn't be happier with this purchase and will definitely pass along my positive experiences to anyone who may be looking for a replacement phone!

"Not bad, not amazing but worth my money","So I broke the screen on my original s10+ and it was cheaper to just buy a refurbished phone the take to a repair shop...However the fastest network for this ""S10+"" is H+.... how? 4G was the lowest speed I get on my cracked phone.Yet... the phone is other wise upgraded software wise??I'm so confused.But happy confused I guess... I live in a 5g area so its not my network provoder and I own a private booster it still won't go over a 3g connection.Othe minor annoyances:The back camera screen was cracked, but you can't tell with gorilla glass on it.The charger they sent with this phone nearly melted and wouldn't charge the phone it was spazzing out going from charging to not charging for a good 5 mins.Luckily it didn't damage the phone which charged just fine on a real Samsung cable afterwards.Lastly it didn't come with the Sim tool like stated, I had to find the one from my old phone (not a big deal).",2021年6月3日 在美国审核

This is NOT a completely unlocked phone,"When you check the phone settings, it will tell you it's a SM-G975U1, which is a completely unlocked phone.That's not the case.I use my phone with Ting, which now has 3 possible service providers:Sprint, T-mobile, and now Verizon.This phone is NOT compatible with Sprint.If you upgrade the phone to Android 10 (or it comes pre-installed), this phone is also NOT compatible with Verizon.There is some incompatibility between Verizon and the Samsung Android 10 implementation that doesn't allow any data connection to work.I can only assume the two companies are pointing their fingers at each other, because there's no ETA for a fix.So the only option is to prevent the phone from upgrading to Android 10 somehow, or downgrade to Android 9 using a process that could possibly brick the phone.In other words:DO NOT BUY!",2020年3月4日 在美国审核

It's an older 'renewed' phone ... can't expect perfect,"Don't care much for Samsungs phones.Too much bloatware &amp; other shhhtuff from service providers.But we needed a Samsung as it was the only brand that will work on the secure system we have to work with.The price of a newer S20 or a new S21 is astronomical.My justification for a renewed S10+ ... I can buy two of these for price of a new one &amp; still save money.Researching the seller is the trick.I needed a seller that would sell me a 'truly' unlocked phone &amp; not a wannabe that is more trouble than necessary.Hybrid IT was one of the only sellers I could find with a rating high enough to feel comfortable with; 98% in the last 12 months.The phone is truly unlocked &amp; everything is working great.There was a slight blemish on one side of the screen I discovered when putting on a screen protector.With the screen protector on the phone, you can't see any blemishes at all.It looks beautiful.The phone was wiped &amp; reset to its factory settings &amp; immediately wanted to update the moment it was connected to a wifi.Initially the S10+ came with Android v9 Pie but after the firmware update it was running v11.I needed v9 or better &amp; didn't want to take the chance with an older phone not updating so the S10+ was a 'bottom of the list' pick for me.Being a 'renewed' phone, the page (Amazon) does warn you of the ""possible"" generic packaging &amp; charger &amp; I expected as much.What I didn't expect &amp; found funny &amp; a touch disappointing was the Lightning charger cable included in the packaging.Samsung S10+ requires a USB-C charger cable, not an Apple Lightning charger cable.The two are completely incompatible.The charger itself is a true generic that has specifications with the S10's necessities so I just need to invest in a USB-C cable.You'd think a seller with a high rating would have enough pride to check their packages before shipping.Perhaps they have a new 17 year old packager who doesn't know the difference ... oh well, like I mentioned earlier, it was funny to find the Lightning cable in the package.",2021年6月16日 在美国审核

Everything I wanted and a grey price,"Was pushed to upgrade by my carrier (AT&amp;T) making network changes.I wanted a reliable fingerprint reader and my wife had the S10+ and loves hers so I pulled the trigger since the price point was VERY attractive.I am finding this phone has plenty of space for apps and performance is snappy.The 5G download speed is outstanding as well. I have been most pleasantly surprised by the 'all day and ilate nto the night"" battery life.When I do run the battery down I'm getting lightning fast recharge with the adaptive fast charging.To be honest, I was dubious about the claims but the night my dog tangled the cords over night and I woke up to less than 10%charge and got to over 60% by the time I finished mycommute less than an hour later.I might note that 60% battery will see me through the workday and my adaptive charger for the car was worth every penny.Other items of note:Graphics are excellent.The camera has done everything I asked it to do including a pretty nice job with low light conditions.Speakers have good volume and passable sound but you will be glad for earbuds if you take your music listening seriously.I might be coming off as a fan-boy, but closer to the.

Screen protectors are factory-fixed in some brands like Vivo and Oppo across all models (which is really useful). I wish Samsung followed it. Aftermarket protectors don't fit properly on the curved Samsung flagship front screens.Also, dual band GPS is available for accurate navigation in Xiomi, one plus flagships which is absent in Samsung flagship models. Hopefully Samsung improves.The camera modules, too, have not seen improvement and remain stagnant. They are the same sized sensors for s9, note9, etc. Other brands upgraded to 1/1.7"" and 1/2"" sensors. Every next model shows improvement in optics and sensors.

"They are lying. It's not renewed, it's unlocked and now doesn't work!","Bought three of these phones. One didn't work and was sent back immediately. Five months later one of the phone's ""calling and receiving calls"" function stops working. I tried having my phone repair service fix it and they tell me it's a phone service issue. I take it to AT&amp;T and they tell me that with the recent upgrade to their cell phone towers that phones that are ""Unlocked"" rather than ""Renewed"" will stop working. They then take a look at the model numbers of the two phones and tell me that they are both unlocked phones and that the phone that is still working will stop working soon as well. Because it's past the return date both the seller and Amazon refuse to refund me for the phones even though they were fraudulently sold as ""Renewed"" when actually they were ""Unlocked."" So I'm out $646.02. Very disappointed that Amazon let's a third party seller get away with fraud and that Amazon didn't have my back. My advice is now what the AT&amp;T rep told me. ""Don't buy a phone from Amazon, because you never really know what you will get."" And let me add there's a pretty good chance you will get screwed.",2022年4月8日 在美国审核

"Not Fake, it's factory unlocked. (Green one I bought)","This is not fake. It took me on we 2 months to finally purchase because I was so scared. Read the reviews about this phone and they were mostly positive. The company also had good ratings but I was still sceptical because of the bad reviews.<br>Firstly, my phone arrived early. And it saved me the trouble of doing without a phone for couple days as my s6 started shutting off.Secondly, the phone was in pretty good condition. I only saw a small crack on the back which is minor.Thirdly, the phone is unlocked. I used T-Mobile and my SIM works works perfectly. It was easy to do smart switch so the phone was up and running. It came in a box, and had a charger. It had a booklet that gives info about contacting your network provider.Fourth, I AM LOVING IT. battery life is good. When it first came I charged it which you should do with every new phone. It did not take forever to charge.</br>",2019年12月4日 在美国审核

"""Renewed"" means ""Used"" pre-owned phone.","I got this 512GB s10+ one day ago.Happy: The phone are well packaged, and the seller, ""Pro Wireless"", use sealed plastic bag for all items.The items include wired AKG ear buds (thanks for seller's kindness), charger, type-c cable, usb 3 female to type-c adapter, and type-c to type-c adapter.Fireware model is G975USQS2ASGB.After a short setup, it seems it is full functional phone and worked out with AT&amp;T as well.I did not see any problem with battery. It comes with around 50%. It can be charged to 100%.I did not test how long it will last in the run.Not so good:There are one small screen crack on the left corner. Since it is very small, it does not impact screen function.There are one significant scratch and many obvious scratch on the screen. All of them do not impact screen function as well.I believe ex-owner did not use screen protector and case to protect this expensive baby. That's why the price costs $200+ less than a new one.Regards to features and specification of S10+, I am ok with it, but I feel the price is bit of high. High end cell phone price was pushed into $1000+ and all functions aimed to be the replacement and invasion of personal life. Only history in the future can say.",2019年12月9日 在美国审核

Unlocked and worked with my service provider,"I was nervous about ordering this phone, because of it's of reviews saying that it arrived locked. This was not the case for me. Overall the phone seems great.I havefew things that are really irritating me. I miss the easy gestures my Motorola has to access the flashlight and camera. I have medium sized hand (for a woman) and I'm finding lots of issues with this, even with my Popsocket installed. I have to stretch to reach the fingerprint sensor.This is more complex technology, but a downgrade from using a place your finger naturally touches when holding the phone. Also, the senor does not work with the screen protector that I bought.Reaching the main 3 bottom buttons are uncomfortable to reach, especially on the bottom right (I'm right handed). I'm hoping that this could be fixed with a system update. I find all the side buttons hard to reach also. When phones were smaller having the high buttons was fine, but now I have to use two hands to press a button. This phone doesn't even appear huge to me.Ergonomics were not carefully thought through. The comfort of navigating and holding my phone is huge to me.",2019年11月2日 在美国审核

A bit more scratch up than I would have liked,This review is for the Samsung Galaxy S10+. Received a day early. Plain white box with new charger and cord. No directions but didn't need or expect any. The phone is scratch up a bit more than advertised but with a case and screen protector you can't see them. The phone only has 79% battery life as mesaure with a battery app called AccuBattery (Am sure there are other apps that measure the same) after 3-full 100% to 0% charges.Over all am happy with the phone (Awesome Phone and camera) and not worth returning since case hides the faults and 1% less battery life than advertised is not worth the effort. I'm sure there are better phones but for $224.00 it was worth it.,2022年4月1日 在美国审核

Had I been proficient enough it would have been unlocked in 15-30 minutes. It cost $60 or $90, but well worth it. I'll try to find the name of the company I used. The phone works great now with the exception of when I put my SD card in, the phone won't work. I'm going to try to put the SIM card back in the old one and slide it into my new phone, hoping that there's just something wrong with the tray they sit in.",2021年10月17日 在美国审核

"Great value, great phone.","I was wondering what phone to get for a few months now since my old phone wasn't working the way it should. I eventually decided the Samsung galaxy s10+ provided me with all the things I want in a phone 8GB ram, headphone Jack, great cameras, great speaker and current android. I was a little worried about buying this phone renewed considering it's been a year since the phone was released. Also, I never bought a renewed phone. So I was very afraid to receive it and I also had already received the accessories I bought for this phone so if I didn't like it I would have spent too much money on something Ididn't like. When I received my phone yesterday I was surprised to how new it looked and it had the screen protectors both on the front and back of the phone. The front screen protector seemed to have a hole and a scratch though but I bought one so I didn't mind replacing it. The phone came with a charger and the cable unfortunately it did not include the pin to open the sim card and sd card tray. Luckily I saved the pin from my leg phone.1. I love how there wasn't that much bloat wear on it.2. Download Accubattery the moment you receive it as I had found out after purchasing that Amazon Amazon renewed phone have at least 80% battery capacity. Accubattery will tell you how much battery capacity is on your phone, min ranged from 95-97% on 2 phone charges since I received it yesterday.3. I easily transferred files by downloading Smart Switch in my old phone. It is already included on Samsung phones. I did the wireless transfers. You will need to backup WhatsApp and WeChat if you use those as you will have to transfer it through those apps and not on Smart Switch. Smart Switch comes in handy for anyone who likes having old text messages transferred over.4. Make sure you have a pin to open the sd card | sim card tray.5. Fingerprint sensor is ok. It works 95% of the time for me.Overall definitely have not been disappointed with my purchase so far and I know it's been a day but if anything comes up, I'll update on here.-update:Just realized my phone software is Verizon, not tmobile however it still works but can't tell if I'm getting software updates since apparently there is a March 13 update but I have yet to receive it despite clicking updates on my phone.",2020年3月12日 在美国审核

EXCELLENT PHONE,"COMPANY: OM-WIRELESSITEM: Samsung Galaxy S10+, 1TB, Ceramic Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)MODEL: SM-G975U1My Item came in the original box, with the original paperwork, with the original charger and a USB C power cord.

This was better than I expected, so I was well pleased.This ""Fully Unlocked"" phone was easy to set up with my phone carrier and I have used it for two weeks and it seems flawless.Be sure to do your homework, to make sure that the phone you buy is a match for you, as the company (OM-WIRELESS) isn't very knowledgeable at answering questions, and they are not very quick to respond, so do your homework, (I took off 1 star because of poor communication).That said, again, the item looks and seems flawless !!(and I am very, very happy with it so far)I would buy from this seller again, (provided I didn't have to ask them any questions, as they don't seem to be very knowledgeable).",2021年10月17日 在美国审核

I ordered one of these back in October, the phone itself was in great condition, no scratches, looked brand new, however... the camera was damaged and had a spec on every picture I took. I asked for a replacement but instead I was refunded my money and the price increased by $70 the next day. I've waited MONTHS for the price to drop again so I can reorder.. well it finally did but once again I was sent an even worse phone. The charging port was FULL of lint, the phone itself showed a warning sign when charging and the screen is full of scratches.guess I'll take another refund and order from someone else.",2021年7月11日 在美国审核

Look at the sellers! Not all phones are correctly listed as your carrier,"First of, let me point out that every one of these renewed phones comes from a different seller that is NOT Amazon, so people's experiences are based off of individual sellers and not Amazon.This is my second renewed phone from Ana Amazon Seller and it works great BUT it won't text. When the description says ""fully unlocked,"" that doesn't mean factory unlocked. The first phone I got was for AT&amp;T/Tmobile but it was still locked to Tmobile and wouldn't work. This second phone works on my network and everything, but something is delayed or stopping my texts on occasion. I've been on the phone with AT&amp;T everyday for a week but still no fix. The phone was previously locked to Sprint and looks like has some sort of issue with the AT&amp;T network.The phone is perfect with no scratches or damage. Powered on without an issue. Set up was fine.But if you get this phone, don't spend your entire day setting up. Put your sim card in FIRST andmake sure IT WORKS. I spent hours setting up my first phone only for the sim not to work. This second phone worked as soon as I put the sim card in but the texting issue is sporadic and you couldn't tell there was an issue until your texts fail to send or you get a pile of texts half an hour after they were sent.As for replacements from the sellers, you need to do a return, wait for them to approve it, then you have to pay return shipping. They will not send you a replacement, you need to do another purchase. Because of that, my Amazon credit card bill sky rocketed and it takes them weeks to process the return to put the money back into my account. If I need to return the second phone bwchzwe AT&amp;T can't fix the texting, then I will need to purchase A THIRD phone and put another $500 on my account until the other returns are processed. Message the sellers before purchase if you can.",2020年6月26日 在美国审核

Good phone that I'm still getting used to.,"Upgraded from MOTO G7 Power and here's my take. The Moto has a bigger battery but this one is doing fine.

Camera was one of my main reasons for choosing S10.The S10 has lots more memory 512 vs 64 and 8 vs 4 gb ram.I struggle more to open this phone, but once in it rewards with power and functionality.All in all a good buy.Received in like new condition without any micro scratches.

Beautiful phone,"I returned this phone because of a couple glitches and shaky video. After going through three other Samsung phones since, I'm realizing that the two glitches (at least one of them anyway), aren't glitches after all. Apparently, Samsung built these ""glitches"" into their new phones. One widget ""glitch"" is with the weather widget. Before this OS change, when you have the weather widget on the home screen, you swipe down slightly on the widget and the city changes. I could swipe through 10 cities in 10-seconds. It doesn't do that anymore. Now, if you want to look at 10 different cities, give yourself a few minutes. This is a big deal to me because I change cities often. Now we have to tap the widget - go to settings - change the city - go back to the home screen, and then do that process all over again to go another city. A 1-second swap is now a 20-second swap.The battery life is top notch, phone looks beautiful, and it's extremely fast.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核

No problems with this Renewed S10+,"I was a little nervous about the ""renewed"" (vs. refurbished) concept. But I didn't want to spend $800-$1000 for a ""new"" phone. Spoke with a friend who is a cell phone reseller on the side and he assured me it would be fine. And it has been for two weeks. No scratches or any other noticeable ""pre-owned"" issues.We wanted unlocked phones as we were leaving Boost Mobile [with the other droves] and like to use our phones overseas when we vacation by simply buying Vodaphone [or other providers] sim cards so we can use Google Maps, texting etc.So this will check all the boxes.We switched over to T-Mobile and just had them pop in the sim card, added our SD expansion card from my wife's other phone and bada-bing it worked flawlessly and my wife reports zero issues.The only very minor thing is there was NO MANUAL. Of course, today most of us are all pretty tech savy with our phones and they are so intuitive that really has not been an issue. Especially since we have been Samsung Galaxy users for about 6 years this wasn't a big deal. I only mention that IF YOU NEED A MANUAL.

Permanent Screen Protector or Liquid Glass added to Screen - take note,"Pros: Quick Arrival, body of phone in great condition, screen initially looked good, great battery life.Cons: Permanent Screen Protector (I believe liquid glass), no fingerprint recognition, occasional touchscreen sensitivity or delay, wireless charging issuesThe long of it:This was probably my fault for not reading carefully enough or not really understanding what liquid glass is, since I've never used it.I cannot get the phone to read my fingerprint or wireless charge which I think is due to the ""permanent screen protector"".At least my online forum reading has lead me to this conclusion.I've never had these issues before and I've never had a phone with this kind of screen protector. Additionally, when putting my phone case on, I pushed hard on the top corner and the screen protector cracked.Not the screen.Just the hard plastic-ish screen protector.The screen is actually un-cracked but now the screen protector is peeling back further and further a tiny little bit at a time.I mean tiny and I have to pick away little pieces and it appears as though there is now a long crack on the upper left corner but, again, the actual screen is fine underneath but everything I can find is telling me there is no 'safe' way to remove this kind of screen protector so I'll just deal with it. However, knowing what I know now, I would not recommend using this kind of screen protector.The screen looks cracked and the phone repair place said they would charge me for a full screen replacement since they cannot remove the protector so it doesn't feel like it protected anything because it 'cracked' so easily while putting on a phone protection case.No service problems with the actual company.",2021年2月9日 在美国审核

"Better to buy New than ""Renewed"" from these guys","I gave the seller a second chance at trading out the previous device they mailed me.

Its probably the same adhesive that made the forst device they shipped me lose its back glass. The seller said they would check it but this seems like a case of ""Good Enough ♂""<br>Below was my review for the original device the seller mailed as ""Renewed""----------After owning a Galaxy s8 for several years now, I decided it was time for an upgrade.Waited eagerly for this phone to arrive, and today was the day. I open it up pop my SIM card in and connected it. At first I thought I felt the backpiece wigglin but I figured it was just my hands getting used to a bigger phone. Not even 3 hours into owning this device, the back piece came completely off. I took the chance to compare it to an iFixIt video and I can tell there are screws missing and the wireless charging piece was put on crooked. Very poor use of ""Renewed.""

So the phone was suddenly an expensive brick that we have to go through the hassle of factory resetting and packaging and mailing back to the seller, finding a replacement phone and waiting for that to come to try this all again....

But since I don't have sprint, the update fails and uses mobile data.I also can not make MMS messages or receive them. After 4 hours on the phone with my carrier. They placed the blame on Samsung not releasing a patch for unlocked phones to send MMS messages. Which, by law. They are required to allow the full unlocking of phones.Beside these problems. I really love the quality of the phone itself. It was a major upgrade for me, as I had a Galaxy J7 Crown.The camera is amazing. The video is equally amazing.

GRANTED I was expecting this with used Samsung phones, BUT the price should be less than what i paid for (~$300) if this is what I'm getting. I will be testing out the battery in different uses (games, drones, ect), but currently the battery drops 2% in 3 hrs not used and not connected to wifi/cellular. I get about 6% battery use per continual filming of 15 mins at 1080p 30 fps. and about 1% battery use for 5-8 mins of normal use, but I will update once I completed testing it.I will also add photos at a later time, and will update connectivity/unlocked status once I connect to a mobile service provider.I got this purely for the camera and to use for drone flying, so I'm not fretting to much. But if you are planning on buying as your standalone day to day cell, I would implore you to invest a little more on a new unit due to the battery.

However, even after AT&amp;T transferring everything from my old cell to this new cell, I had no voicemail, even though, after checking my apps, themselves, it says my visual voicemail had also been transferred to the new cell, but, I have no way of getting voice mail. It tells me to dial *86, but, I get a recording that says it's not the correct number. I've tried installing different apps, but then it asks for my Samsung password, which I can't remember. When I try to reset it, I get a message that sounds like I'm going to have to reset my entire phone, and possibly lose everything that's on there, so, I'm afraid to take the chance. Good thing, is, that my SIM card from my old cell works in this one. I didn't need a new one of them, since I didn't even get one of them with this new phone. Nor did I get any kind of instructions with the new cell. So, what I did, was, put SIM card back in my old cell, looked up the voicemail number to call to get voicemail, then put that in my contact list on the new cell. So, I can get voicemail by actually dialing that number.Next, I've tried to pay my online credit card through the app on the cell. But, that also has to be all reset. That's when I get a message that says they're texting me 6 digit code that I have to send to them to confirm it's really me. However, the text never comes through. I've tried different things, with no luck. Now, I'm not saying every renewed cell will have these problems... it might just be mine, or just an isolated incident. But, I will probably be sending it back. Next time I'll just buy a brand new cell... possibly an S20.B Andrews",2021年8月28日 在美国审核
The company that refurbs these did something that blew my mind,"When I first received the refurbed phone it looked good, until I turned it on... Once I turned it on I noticed there was a weird circle in the middle lower section of the screen. You could see through the circle but the circle was so noticeable it was distracting. I decided Id mess with it a bit and see if i could get used to it but shortly after that I encountered an additional problem. There were a couple of keys on the on screen keyboard that mis-clicked a lot. I decided to take the tempered glass screen protector off that the refurb company had put on there to see if that was the cause of the issue thinking if thats all it was I just order a new screen protector and be done with it. Well to my amazement when I went to remove the screen protector I found out what that circle was in the middle of the screen. IT WAS GLUE! THEY GLUED THE GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR ON TO THE SCREEN! Which meant not only did it produce that annoying circle but also meant that if you ever broke the screen protector youd be unable to pull it off and replace it. Not only that but once I removed all of the screen protector except the circle that the glue was holding in place I tested the 2 keys out that werent working right again and low and behold they worked just fine once they were uncovered. Im convinced it was the fact that the protector was glued on that caused all these issues because after returning this refurb I went to new egg and bought another refurb phone just like this not realizing it was from the same refurbishing company. YUP!, you guessed it It had the same crappy circle of glue in the middle of the screen and while I had a bit of a different issue with the glued on screen protector interfering with proper screen performance it was still causing problems none the less. Why this company would do this is beyond me, Ive seen some dumb things in my time but this one is definitely in the top 5.",2020年12月25日 在美国审核
Not off to a good start…UPDATED,"UPDATE: I have had the phone a few weeks now and it works fine with a good lasting battery charge. Other than the screen being scratched up, it is worth it to just keep it at this point. To be fair, switched rating from 1 star to 3 stars because it works.I don’t know how this phone functions yet, as I just got it today and opened the box and I’m already very disappointed! The front of this phone is VERY scratched and looks like it’s been thrown around quite a bit. I have owned several phones for years at a time and none of them got scratches on the display! This is ridiculous. The phone wasn’t charged, so I have it on a charger now. I may try to see how it performs but do not want to go through with the whole set up if it functions as bad as the screen looks. If I decide to keep it and it runs good/great, I may come back to change my review, but as of now and the way it looks for almost $300 after “taxes”, it’s not looking too promising. ",2022年2月8日 在美国审核

"Definitely a reconditioned with a new screen, but not the best...","I took a chance with this one. It arrived in a generic box with the charger and cable (generic). Once I took it out, the screen looked new, but immediately noticed a 'ripple' effect on the screen. Clearly it has been replaced, which I dont mind, but it was not the best job. It was a glass 'gel replacement' which is how they fix the screen inexpensively. When held against the light in an angle, you get a waterdrop effect.. The back was original, and had acceptable light scratches, nothing crazy. Phone operates fine, sound is good, and once you turn it on, you cannot notice the ripple effect, so I decided to keep it for this reason. It leaves me wondering though about the IP68 rating - is it still valid for 30 mins under water? I would prob not risk it considering the screen was replaced. For the price, I would have expected a 'used' phone in very good condition. If the screen was replaced, I would have expected OEM parts or a new digitizer altogether. I honestly would not pay more than three hundred for this phone, but since I already have it. I will keep it.",2021年3月11日 在美国审核

The build quality is also premium with glass and metal. The screen is amazingly beautiful. This is Samsung's best phone on the market. Period.Finally, about the renewed phone condition...Mine appeared to have never been used. Not a single scratch. It was still on Android 10. It even had the original screen protector.It was a Verizon unlocked phone. It changed to T mobile when I put in my Sim. I updated to the latest version of Android.The only drawback was that sitting around idle had made the phone battery degrade to 87 percent health.

NEVER WORKED PROPERLY,"This is a review of the Samsung Galaxy s10 plus, blue... sold by Chubbie. The item arrived perfectly packaged. That's the 1 star. The phone never worked properly. I could never get service even though I had service. So, no phone calls or text messages in or out. And, no internet. The phone would occasionally work inside the house and occasionally (2 mins here or there) inside the cellphone store. I spent over 6 hours at 2 different stores (just in case the person at my original store wasn't a techie) having them try and get service on this phone. 2 new sim cards, verifying apn, setting up a new apn, confirming the phone was compatible with my carrier, resetting the service on the phone itself, resetting multiple settings inside the phone and even so far as to factory reset the phone. It never worked. It had service the entire time, but NEVER worked. What good is a phone that can not call out or receive calls? Do we still have bricks in 2021? I won't even get into the fact that it couldn't even get the text verification in the store to even authorize my account. I had my carrier print out the entirety of everything done to get this phone to work and it never did. The battery also lost charge very quickly even when not in use... BECAUSE IT NEVER WORKED.",2021年7月21日 在美国审核

Would have been an ideal cell phone if it had come unlocked!,"I love the beauty of this Samsung S10plus so I was disheartened after spending hours trying to get it to work to learn that the APN’s were locked down preventing me from activating it. The phone was in good condition with 381 battery cycles used yet the company called KISS did not send me a FULLY UNLOCKED phone as described at Amazon. So disappointed and can’t trust to reorder from them worried I’d get the same thing.Amazon stood behind their renewed warranty and I reordered from another company and the phone came unlocked with only 8 cycles used on the battery. So after incredible frustration trying to get the first one to recognize my sim card in the long run I ended up with a better phone, so I am happy.For the phone it is a delight especially if you are an avid smartphone photographer!

The phone I purchased was the Unlocked Verizon Refurbished version so that may be the reason why I kept having problems along with constantly roaming.

The phones came out less than two years ago, and I received mine with a battery that has already been recharged so many times it's deficient. This means they're REALLY used phones that have almost been run into the ground by the first owner. It's a working s10+. It's going to have problems though. It's $100+ to replace the battery it came with, which would nearly offset just BUYING a new one. So, your call.

No voicemail indicator,"Doesn't indicate when you have voicemail. This phone started out in life as a Sprint phone, and apparently there is known problem caused by the Visual Voicemail App that Sprint loads on its phones. I wonder why, when refurbishing and unlocking the phone, they would choose to ignore a known issue. Research tells me that the app cannot be removed without rooting the phone. While most features on the phone are great, I consider voicemail an important function on a phone. Additionally, while I'm sure many people like the curved sides of the screen, the fingerprint reader being in the screen makes it impossible to use a tempered glass screen protector, and the film protectors that will work with the fingerprint reader will not conform to the curved edges of the screen, in spite of the claims they will ""relax.""",2020年2月4日 在美国审核

I'm afraid to use this charger because it might damage the phone outlet with all the forced action.,2022年1月22日 在美国审核
"Nice little 4G phone, if it's working right.","This is a heck of a lot better than the LG V40 that I replaced. It works better, has a brighter screen.. the battery life is a little iffy, but I keep it plugged in most of the time for my job anyway.I LOVE how FAST it is switching screens between different apps!//edit 6-13-2020I had to have this replaced because the GPS never worked properly. It would show me going down a street BACKWARDS and SIDEWAYS. I'm unsure if this was a phone fault or a network fault, as it was a unlocked phone on a Tmobile network - it's possible that it could be a network issue. Regardless, it's been returned for another one which seems to be working fine.",2020年3月17日 在美国审核
Bluetooth not working,"Phone looks like new. Arrived quickly unlocked. The problem with it is the Bluetooth, we bought this phone and since we got it we had many connection problems, in order to use Bluetooth you have to be only 1 foot away from the phone or it will cut off. We couldn't pair it with smart watch or even use an earbuds because it will cut off, I tried everything and also resetting the phone but unfortunately we had to return it . I give it 3 stars because the seller issued our refund quickly but I wish they inspect the Bluetooth before selling it.",2021年10月30日 在美国审核

"NOT UNLOCKED, DON'T BUY","I ordered this phone, this *Unlocked* all-networks-compatible phone to use with Cricket.

Bonus: the wifi doesn't even work, and was certifiably working for other devices. I was so excited to finally have a new phone, and I'm really disappointed.Now I have to wait up to 48hrs to see if they respond to Amazon's inquiry to exchange this for the correct, unlocked phone that was advertised. Even if they fix it properly, I won't change my rating; they literally had one job.*Update: Customer Service assures me that if I use wifi to circumvent the Verizon registration, the phone should eventually connect to my carrier.

It may be clean but it's not as advertised,I feel like they refurbished this phone with an inferior screen replacement. Besides the battery life being garbage! My wife has one of these phones and the battery easily lasts all day even with heavy use with light use that can last almost 2 days. But not mine not this one. My phone is at 25% by 2:00 in the afternoon at best. And on top of that 5:00 or more parts of my screen just can't be interacted with. I did the touchscreen test and there are several spots that I just can't touch and less I hit the power button and then hit it again then I can touch the whole screen but maybe for 5 or 10 seconds.I asked for a new phone and they said okay. They said that they shipped it and that it would be here in 3 to 5 days. 3 to 5 days later I found out that they never even shipped it and when I asked about it they said I could wait about a week and Amazon would cancel my replacement.

"Terrible scuffing on phone bezel, perfect screen, horrible packaging","I suppose I can't complain given the purchase price (it worked out to about $270CAD shipped), but I am really disappointed in the Amazon Renewed S10+. Every other Amazon Renewed product I have purchased has looked brand new, and come in durable packaging.My phone was taped to a cardboard insert and the only packaging for the phone was the box they shipped the packaging in. At first I thought customs had opened and removed the contents, but upon closer inspection, everything was taped down by the refurbisher/reseller.The metal bezel on the phone is heavily scuffed - I have no idea who owned this before, but it looks like someone took sandpaper to the edges. Strangely, the screen and glass back look perfect.

Texts seldom went through or were received.Took it to the Verizon store thinking it was my sim card. But the same problem persisted, and eventually led to the conclusion the phone was not ""Fully Unlocked.""Now I don't know if the seller genuinely didn't know because of the person they bought it from, or they just sent out a random phone, nor do I care, because the phone simply didn't work.

One Very Upset Customer,"Phone arrived completely dead. Once charged, I could not import data from my old phone. I took the phone to my service carrier only to be told the device was not unlocked and is not compatible with my service carrier. I switched the sim card back to my old phone to then discover it no longer worked. At this point (I'm still at the store) I am told that my service had been suspended because my sercice provider does not support 3G devices and, because my 'new phone' was a 3G device, it automatically suspended my service. Twenty minutes later, customer service was able to reactivate my line.I am beyond upset! I currently have a Galaxy S8 and attempted an upgrade to the Galaxy S10+ to find out, after much trouble, that my new phone was actually a downgrade from the phone I already have.This is completely unacceptable.I've read reviews where customers have returned the item for various reasons, and their refunds were extremely so or not at all. Unfortunately, I read these reviews after my order was placed (which, for this very reason I Never do) but I needed a phone quickly. This seemed like a good deal since it was backed by the Amazon guarantee. I guess we'll see....",2021年5月19日 在美国审核
Horrible Customer Service,"I bought this refurbished from RE-CELL.Right at the end of the return period, the phone developed a bright white bar at the bottom of the screen.Following is the text from our conversations:From: RE-Cell HI there, I apologize for the issues with the device. I would double check to see if you purchased any extended warranties that Amazon provides as options, unfortunately due to the time elapsed since the order was placed the warranty period has expired.

"""Verizon"" model still locked to Sprint overdue account!","This phone was sold to me as a refurbished Verizon Galaxy S10+. In fact, when I received it and inserted my SIM card it did not activate and would fail over and over again. I was able to ""activate"" the device itself through Verizon's website but that still did nothing. The phone cannot connect to the Verizon network. It constantly try's to activate through Sprints network, failing every single time. I cannot update the software either. It drops any type of network connectivity every 15-20 minutes and will display ""Sprint"" in the top left corner of the screen; where the network name should displayI tried to bring it into Sprint to explain the situation and see if they could unlock the phone manually and after telling them the device's IMEI number, they explained to me that they cannot unlock my device because it is tied to a Sprint account with a massive outstanding balance.This phone is essentially a giant paperweight now. Not to mention the headphone jack and charging port were caked with sulfation build up from the battery and moisture exposure.Keep in mind I specifically bought a Verizon based model, according to the seller.This has been an incredible inconvenience as I do a lot of my work via mobile. Extremely unhappy at the lack of vetting and detail or just sheer laziness of this seller. 100% would not recommend. I WILL be returning it for a full refund.",2022年6月25日 在美国审核

Received a defective phone,"I really want to like this phone, and 90% of the time I do, but that percentage is directly related to the fact that I'm staying home all of the time thanks to COVID-19. That's because it works just fine on wifi but is utterly useless and infuriating whenever I need to use the mobile network, like when venturing out of the house or trying to send and received text messages or phone calls. I live in an area with a very strong signal, and the phone itself reports high signal bars at all times, but it mobile data is almost unusably slow when it works at all, which I would guess is only about 15% of the time.If the phone worked, I would love it.Unfortunately it is very hard to love a phone that doesn't work as, you know, a phone.

When tried to reach seller (Promo Dealz), they told that they didn't have ceramic version at that time, why would you charge people extra money for it? If you simply reach buyer and explain at least it would look like honest and clear buiseness, instead you try to trick, and get extra dollars.Why I put 2 stars?

Several issues that I could not fit in the reason for needing to return the items.,"At first, it seemed like a good purchase, but right off the bat, I noticed that the phone's power button had somewhat of a delay. I thought nothing and figured it may have just been a temporary deal. Anyway, I charged it and took it to Verizon. They tried to set it up and while it seemed like it 'accepted the SIM'. The weird thing was that it made calls and took texts, but would not accept the SIM cards. There was also an issue with the touch screen. For example, I couldn't tap certain letters or apps because I guess they weren't detecting any touch (I didn't have a protector on either). Also, the package didn't come with a SIM removal tool, which was OK, but I thought that was odd that it didn't. I don't even recall it coming with some protective later like bubble wrap. I get that these are refurbished, but it's practically not 'usable'. I can't utilize all parts of the touch screen and it won't recognize the Verizon sim.

We initially tried consulting T-mobile and they advised that there was nothing wrong with their signals. We have not been able to use the phone in the way intended because 4-months after we realized the phone was not actually unlocked. We attempted to contact the seller but they insist that they are past the 90 day warranty period and cannot make this right, despite selling a product not as advertised (unlocked). It’s unfortunate to deal with sellers like this during a pandemic, especially considering this was my only way to communicate and can’t even make emergency calls now. The wifi calling does not work either. I’m down $500 and have a clock. Consider investigating the seller and reading previous reviews before buying.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核

Microphone to place and receive voice calls does not work - to low to hear,"This is my second Renewed phone and the expectations were not fulfilled as per the Renewed promise.3 major issues I have with this pone are: volume of the device when making and receiving voice phone calls, scratches on the item and the accessories.1. I always wanted to have this phone and particular model because it has nothing to envy when it comes to appearance, performance and features to similar or recent models.Most importantly for me is to be able to make and receive phone voice calls but that is simply impossible because the volume of the device when in microphone mode is so low that you can not hear the other person nor they can hear you back. - I don't have the same hearing issue when in speaker mode or when syncing to my Bluetooth earbuds2. The item came with scratches on the edges like if someone used it before.3. The charger and cable are not recognized by the device and a message pop up to check and use for supported accessories. - They do charge my phone but it takes ages to get a full charge.

BEWARE: Read Reviews!,"I wish I would've read the reviews before I bought from this seller... The phone looks good with no scratches or anything. It LOOKS brand new, I'll give them that.. but when I switched my Sims card over to this phone, I got NO bars.. couldn't call, couldn't text and couldn't use my mobile data. I reached out to Verizons live chat and was told that it was my Sims card.. So the next day I went to the Verizon store.. got a new Sims card and it still wouldn't work. A tech came to see what he can do and come to find out It's NOT the Sims card! It's the PHONE! Was told that whoever ""refurbished"" the phone didn't do a good job and knocked lose a part that aids in my ""activation"" and the connection to the towers.So no matter what I do, this phone will NEVER activate my service; was told to return it and get a refund.

Broken Promises :^(,I'm not going to say do not buy but use caution when purchasing. I took a chance and bought a unlocked Galaxy S10 Plus and when it arrived I set the phone up called the number on the box to set up MetroPCS / T-Mobile service.Completed that and when I left the house to go to work and my phone instantly lost signal. I had to keep rebooting and restarting my phone to send a text or call. This problem continued for three days straight. Even after going to MetroPCS and having them call customer service to troubleshoot why my phone won't stay connected. It works fine on Wi-Fi but once I leave the house it is useless.

"Carrier Unlocked, NOT ""Factory Unlocked"".","The phone looked brand new. After turning it on, I got a message saying that the network could not be verified, that I needed to contact Sprint. That's when I realized that the phone was linked to a carrier before and it was not ""Factory Unlocked"" as specified in the description. After inserting my AT&amp;T SIM Card, the phone connected to the network and started working which was good but I had an icon all the time saying it was attempting to connect to Sprint to validate which was annoying. Then I started trying the phone for 1 week and it seemed to lose connectivity to LTE network and going back to 3G. I also noticed that the phone would heat up during phone calls probably after 5 minutes on a phone call, you would not be able to hold the phone on your hand because it was extremely hot. After some reaserch, I found that that's a common issue for S10s from SPRINT (not sure about the other carriers)Called Amazon to try to fix it and they were helpful and put me through to Samsung. I shipped the phone to Samsung for a motherboard replacement. After getting my phone back, it was locked to the sprint network again so I could not use my phone anymore.Tried reaching out to Sprint but they were as useless as always. Had to send the phone back to amazon because I can't use it anymore.I'd recommend reaching out to the seller before placing an order and asking if they have a phone that belonged to your current carrier so you don't can minimize the amount of problems.",2019年11月12日 在美国审核
Stay away from Samsung if you want quality,"Horrible excuse for a phone. I wish HTC were still making new android phones, they were the best. Everything about this phone is off, the placement of the backspace on the keyboard and the accuracy of the touchscreen for example, it constantly registers me hitting the letter ""L"" rather than the backspace despite my thumb hitting the backspace. Predictive text is absolutely atrocious and won't pick up what word I am typing until I type 80% of the word, then I could select the word to move on quicker, but before that it will suggest words that have no place in the sentence I'm typing.The fingerprint scanner is built into the screen, rather than a separate button, this makes it much less sensitive/accurate. I constantly have to put my finger on there several times or give ups and just enter my code. The curved edges of the screen serve no logical purpose other than them bragging that they're there. They only thing they are good for is helping to ruin your screen protector by allowing it to slide off to one side easier.Battery life is good, that's about the only good thing I have to say about it, but you HAVE to use a Samsung brand charger. I tried using a quick charger from a different phone manufacturer, and it would not charge.",2021年4月19日 在美国审核

"Great phone, but always check the SELLER","This phone is perfect for my needs as a previously limited-app, non-gaming user.Now I'm using more apps, games and functions that my previous S9 couldn't even dream about.The functionality in this S10+ model leapfrogged exponentially.The phone itself was so pristine, one would think it was brand new- which I really didn't care about at this excellent price, but it's totally gift-able :)Huge internal storage capacity (probably more than I need), great camera for a phone (I'm a photographer and prefer actual cameras), and not too large. No S-pen, if that's what you need.Battery life under 35°F isn't optimal, or even very functional until it's warmed up next to body for ~30 min, but at this price, what battery is?Lesson learned: do not leave in cold vehicle for 3+ hours, haha.I purchased this phone I am reviewing 2.5 weeks ago from Re-Cell in CO.Superior service and communication from this seller.Caveat Emptor: I had previously purchased this same model a couple months back but had issues with it being locked to a certain carrier.Seller told me that it was *my* problem, or my new carrier's problem, which sent me on a very non-excellent adventure for a few weeks... they were poor at e-mail communication, and I had to find their phone number on my own.Finally, after a strongly-worded phone call, the shifty company had me send it back to them, but they could not unlock it; told me that sometimes their Unlocked phones ""slip through the cracks.""They should have known this instead of blaming me for being incompetent right off the bat. Very sketchy company out of Edison,NJ, and they've changed company names at least twice. Please beware.",2021年12月21日 在美国审核
I would call it clearly used not renewed but the seller made right,The screen has scratches on it and the edges see scratched and dinged. Also around the camera there was a lot of wear. I did not attempt to activate or turn on the phone. This may not bother some people if you put on a case and all it would not be as noticeable. But the scratches on the screen are the most bothersome to me. For a $340 used phone I guess I expected it to look newer. I can't judge the functionality as I did not use.<br>After contacting seller and finding that functionally the item was great they offered a partial refund as the item looked used instead of new. I did keep the item and received a partial refund. They were very helpful to make things right and very fast with communication.</br>,2021年5月21日 在美国审核
Such a difference from S6,"What a great phone!Had galaxy s6. I keep my phones as long as I can. Finally s6 going bad.

Battery life is fantastic! I will charge my phone before bed, then leave it on and only mute the phone for bed and 8 hrs later when I wake up, I have 97% battery life!Doesn't get any better than that!

Was Not Expecting Very Fast Overnight Delivery,"Review of Samsung Galaxy S10+ Original Release Date 2019.For last 30 yrs I've used Tracfone Prepaid with ATT service except Tracfone sold out to VerizonAT&amp;T is the only tower close to my home; no other carrier gives me even one bar.At the same time AT&amp;T shut down 3G in Feb 2022, my LG G6 stopped working. I keep mobile phones a very long time, so I polled my friends and ended up searching for S10+.I also searched for an ATT MVNO and found RedPocket.The problem was finding the correct S10+ Model # that was compatible with ATT, not all S10+ are VoLTE enabled. Finally Chubbiestech listed Model G973F and I emailed them to confirm that was the correct Model. They replied with Yes it is the correct model # so I placed the order.Amazing, I received the S10+ today, the next day from NY to FLA. Although it's a different model #, I'm so happy because it works. The phone appears to be in new condition even though it's renewed.Thank you Chubbiestech/Cellfeee for the excellent customer service and what I hope will be an excellent product.",2022年6月29日 在美国审核

10/04/21 REVIEW OF S10 PLUS FULLY UNLOCKED PHONE/This listing and store front keeps changing.,"This listing and seller name keeps changing Buyer Beware this use to say the seller was WBB LLC now says something different I have seen the sellers name change within the last few days, twice now! Buyer Beware!Hopefully this review will help all of you.I'll start by saying this phone is unlocked as it says, but ours was a unlocked Verizon phone and will not receive any updates NO security updates and NO new android updates, unless your phone carrier is verizon.It will work with any carrier as it says, you can connect it to your cellphone provider, but it will not get updated to the latest android system or any security updates. You would have to flash firmware on to phone to get it to receive updates.This was very misleading and upsetting when we got the phone.What I suggest is, what ever your carrier is, buy there version of their phone, that way you are guaranteed updates. Example&gt; If you have Metro or T mobile, look for a t mobile unlocked phone.If you have Verizon as your cellphone carrier, get an unlocked Verizon phone.If you have ATT as your cell provider get an unlocked ATT phone. Trust me if your going to spend $250 or more dollars for refurbished you need to get your security updates and android 11 or 12 updates its only fair!Thank heavens Amazon took care of this issue for me. I was quite upset when we found this phone was useless with Metro PCS. I wish sellers were honest and would say no updates on this device.. Instead if you notice they leave out anything in the description about updates.One more bit of info the phone itself was in really good condition! But the whole reason were updating was to get the Samsung support for this model as we have old note 8's. Our note 8 had a more recent security update than this newer phone. We were updating for the security portion of the phonenot just to have a cool newer phone.So good luck remember if you don't have Verizon as your cellphone carrier and you don't no how to flash firmware, look elsewhere, this isn't the phone for you, unless you don't want updates. Also make sure to take screen shots of your purchases. Use your phone take a picture of the screen or take a screen shot with your computer for your backup on item description.",2021年10月4日 在美国审核
Perfect for the price,"Don't trust the negative reviews. Besides some slight scratches on the back that I don't really care about because I'm going to use the phone case anyway, the phone works perfectly fine with my AT&amp;T sim card. With that price, I really can't complain.",2021年8月20日 在美国审核

Junk Phone,"Phone was working phenomenally for about 3 days. After that everything works on it except to make and receive calls. I've factory reset it, I've called ATT, who then transferred me to Samsung. They remotely looked into the phone and still couldn't figure it out. I tried downloading a different calling app even (Google Phone) and still, am unable to make and receive calls. Very inconvenient if I end up having to return it and wait forever again for a replacement. I've never really had any bad experiences when it comes to Amazon. But this could be the first. Hopefully someone can resolve this or I hate to say, I'll have to ask for a refund! I've even bought a new sim card to see if that was the issue. ATT Prepaid told me phone isn't compatible.",2022年3月11日 在美国审核

Doesn't have a single scratch.I will also add that I didn't need to charge it for two whole days! I don't live on my phone but I do spend at least a few hours a day on it. Overall I'm pretty happy with the phone.<br>P.S.Side note, I originally thought I bought the Galaxy note 10+.

Almost as good as new,"I must have spent hours going through reviews on this page, so when I clicked on the ""order"" button, I was already determined to add my two cents to them...I received my phone within a day, and on first inspection, it looked really good. Only when I was cleaning the screen like a maniac to put the protector on did I notice some minuscule scratches on it, never to be seen under the protector anyway. The IMEI test came back clean and having had the phone for close to two weeks now, I haven't had any problems at all.The phone came in a generic box with a charger, a charging cable, and one of the tools to open the sim card slot (by now, I have decided that stud earrings are more convenient for that job). The phone was factory reset with no company affiliation, so no bloatware. Setting it up with Mint Mobile took me about 5 minutes, mostly to copy the settings for wireless data. There was no manual in the box, but this is easily found on the Samsung website, and who wants paper copies anyway.There are five things that I bought (or had laying around anyway) to get the phone to fully functional:* a screen protector* a case (at $500 it's still a lot of money to break)* a MicroSD card. I was debating to reuse the one from my old cell phone, but they are cheap enough and did not want to sort through the photos on that one at that point* earbuds* even though it came with a charging cable, it was pretty short and I ended up getting a longer one. The one it came with got commissioned in the car.The phone itself is a bit larger than what I had envisioned, but no complaints there. The only thing with the size was that it did feel a bit awkward in the beginning when I tried to talk without a headset; having it in a waist pouch and talking using a headset is way more convenient for me. The camera looks great, but I need to play more with it to really learn its tricks. All the apps I was used to are working great. Overall a great experience!",2020年6月13日 在美国审核

Amazing Refurbished S10+,"I use the S10+ as my secondary phone to my iPhone 12 Pro Max and I must say I love it quite a lot. The phone despite being a few years old at this point still runs flawlessly and smooth.The battery life may have been depreciated due to it being refurbished, but for what I paid it still works perfectly. In my opinion the best way to go is to buy a high end refurbished phone from a few generations and replace the battery. You would have a much better experience and time rather than brand new mid range phones of the same price. However, keep in mind that this phone has only a year of Major android version updates left, but security updates would still get pushed regardless.The android versions don't really matter all too much as Android has hit a point of maturity where Android 8 through 11 isn't a whole lot different and they all perform pretty similarly. So you can continue using the phone for quite sometime even after official major android updates have stopped.In terms of performance the Snapdragon 855 paired with 8GB of RAM works wonders. The phone has never lagged and I doubt it will. The cameras still hold up pretty well.I highly recommend getting the phone around $200 to $250 if your budget allows for it",2021年8月12日 在美国审核

My experience has been flawless,"So, I wasn't in the market for a new phone, but when the screen on my S8 completely died, I kind of had to do some research pretty quickly.Since I don't need the newest, best phone out there, I decided that the S10 Plus was the one for me. Better yet, I decided that I've had good experience with Amazon recertified, refurbished, whatever products in the past, so I was willing to gamble on a refurbished phone if it could save me a significant amount of money, and I'm writing this review to let you know that I'm so glad I did!For starters, I purchased the Verizon model, since I have Verizon service. I don't think that actually mattered, though, because I'm fairly certain I have an unlocked model. It does not have any company branding or software installed, and the first time I booted the phone up with my Verizon SIM card, it informed me that it was going to restart itself to format itself for Verizon. And then that was it. No Verizon bloatware or anything, and just a Samsung logo when I start it up. So that was an unexpected plus, especially since buying the Verizon one was $20 cheaper than buying the unlock one!The phone itself looks brand new. There was a single smudge on the back of the phone, which I was able to very easily clean off, and there is literally no other indication that this phone has ever been handled before. The battery life is phenomenal and the condition is flawless.I was admittedly a bit skeptical of buying a recertified phone, but 3 days in, I have what I'm fairly confident is a brand new phone for about 25% of the cost of buying it new.Highly highly recommended! :)",2021年9月4日 在美国审核

Why is the battery so slow to charge?,"Compared to a Huawei mate 9 and a Pixel2 XL, the Lock Screen operation of fingertip or facial recognition both pale in comparison to the super-quick response of the rear-touch fingertip operation of my prior phones. Both ways on this Samsung are inferior. Then there's the battery. Slow to charge and not slow to discharge. By the way, I am not using the charger sent w/ this phone. Using a better, hi-powered one.Screen is nice. Camera is good.",2021年11月23日 在美国审核
Great condition!,"I love my new phone it just came in today, it actually came a day earlier so that's great! The phone overall is in good condition the back has a couple of small barely visible scratches or dings but nothing too major , the phone was fully unlocked so that was amazing since a couple of other people had some issues with theirs and I was worried about that happening to me but thankfully mine came in almost perfect condition :)",2021年4月23日 在美国审核

Absolutely perfect,"Perfect condition straight out of the box. The only thing I found to be a bit annoying was the fact that the charger I was sent was a very poor quality box and I also received no charging cable. I literally got the phone a sim tray tool and a charging box. Thankfully I already had another S10+ that came with the actual Samsung charger and a good quality cable. The other thing was that the firmware on the phone I received was T-mobile firmware. It was advertised as unlocked and not just specifically an unlocked T-mobile phone. Luckily for me this wasn't an issue and I simply flashed the unlocked firmware to the phone immediately inserted my sim card and it worked with the new firmware since it wouldn't recognize my sim card being installed with the firmware that was present when the phone arrived. Other than that though the phone was in immaculate condition for something that was pre-owned and only 1/3 the price of a brand new model. Not a single scratch anywhere on the phone and the battery life is better than expected considering I've been using the other one I have since it was brand new and it doesn't last as long as this one. Amazing quality, amazing service other than the charger not having a cable and me having to flash the firmware myself but I planned to flash it anyway so no big deal there. Thanks so much for beating my expectations!",2021年8月21日 在美国审核

Unbelievable price for this phone | Excellent Condition,"Ok so reading the top reviews on this page I obviously was a little worried. The ones you first see, that have the most helpful markings, all claim to received a defective product. While I don't doubt some or maybe even all of those are true, I believe that most people don't receive such a product, and if they did, they could probably just get a new one that isn't messed up.If you read the reviews that are recent, you'll find a lot of people saying they got exactly what they ordered, and to trust that you'll receive a working Samsung S10+ in good condition. I trusted them and am very glad I did. The phone I received is what I'd say is perfect condition. It looks new, feels new, runs new, is fully unlocked, is super fast, and has no issues. The screen doesn't have the slightest mark, and neither does any other part of the phone. The battery life seems like it may be a tiny bit less than brand new, but maybe not since it has dropped 23% over 7 hours with on and off use. I'm not sure. I haven't written a review before, but with the quality of this product, I felt it most definitely deserved so.Not only am I pleased with the fact that I received something better than I even expected, the phone itself is amazing. Way better than the iPhone XR or iPhone 11 I had. The last samsung I had was an S7, and I am very excited to have a galaxy again. For the price, I don't think there is a better option out there for a very fast and sharp looking smartphone.If you are looking at this phone but worried because of all the negative reviews marked the most helpful, know that those are probably the few unlucky cases if they are even true, and reality is, as inconvenient it would be to a defective product like that, I doubt that they were ""stuck"" with it and couldn't return it.I would most definitely buy this product again, and at the price may even buy an extra in case I lose mine or break it.",2021年7月23日 在美国审核
"Phone is fine, seller great!","I HATE getting a new phone! I'm super fussy about how I want mine set up so I spend day after frustrating day trying to get it right. And moving to a different brand adds to the frustration.I liked my original Google Pixel XL a lot. It was really comfortable and just worked the way I wanted it to. But it started dying finally... Got this Samsung Galaxy S10+ renewed from Gizmotrader. They are the best!The phone is like new. So far it works well (having to get used to it). Seems like everything works perfectly.When I bought it, my charge didn't go through. (oops!) I contacted Gizmotrader and they were super understanding and patient about waiting the day or two for me to fix it. Once paid, they sent it immediately, and quickly. It arrived complete except without the SIM tool. They apologized and sent one out right away.If I were going to buy another phone (God forbid), I would search out Gizmotrader for my purchase.",2021年8月10日 在美国审核

Virtually indistinguishable from being new,"Purchased a couple weeks back now, and so far I am very satisfied. No scratches on the screen or camera lenses, and almost unnoticeable marks/scratches on the bottom and near the sim card tray. However with a case on, like the headline says, it is indistinguishable from being new.The only tell of real use is the battery health. The battery's capacity was ~3150mAh out of the 4000mAh that it starts with. It still lasts plenty long, a couple days, on a full charge. Though, I only like to 'full charge' to 80% in order to maximize my battery's lifespan.I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but I specifically made sure to go through Chubbiestech since another phone I got from them was in even arguably even better condition. The battery on that one was ~4350mAh out of 4500mAh.",2021年8月10日 在美国审核

Am Amazing Product,"I've had this phone for almost two weeks, so this is only my initial impression. I was very pleased to find how good of a condition this phone was in. I'm not kidding..... it is like new. Not a mark on it, not even the smallest scratch that I could find!It functions like a new phone in every way. Big test was how the battery would hold out as I used it all day at work. Listening to podcasts all day, texting, phone calls, some internet usage. It passed the test no problem. Still about 40 % left by the time I got home.I love this phone and what a deal compared to the price when new!!What's really good is that I just received the Samsung Android 12 One UI 4.1 update (this is the latest one). And with it,the latest security patch. From what I've read, this model should continue to get regular, quarterly security updates, so I feel good about using this phone for a while.And kudos to Amazon Refurbushed, for ensuring I received another great product from a good seller.All around, an excellent experience.I give it 10 out of 5 stars!",2022年5月25日 在加拿大审核
El producto está acorde con la descripción,"El producto es justamente como se describe. Hasta ahora solo llevo tres días de uso, y el teléfono responde bien. La batería dura un poco menos de lo esperado, pero es un tema de consumo de energía de los teléfonos de Samsung en general (probablemente agravado un poco considerando que el producto es renewed). En general, estoy satisfecho con el producto y la compra, considerando el gran ahorro que representa versus un producto totalmente nuevo. Si bien el teléfono se ve con un poco de uso, la realidad es que no he encontrado defectos físicos o imperfecciones relevantes, y todo parece estar en orden. La entrega de hizo en tiempo. Actualización: detecté un par de rayones en el equipo, nada serio y supongo que se deben al uso; mantengo la calificación ya que el producto es tal como se describe.",2020年1月13日 在墨西哥审核

AMAZON NO SE HACER RESPONSABLE,"Jamás compren un Celular Renewed, es tirar su dinero, yo compré un Galaxy S10+ en $13,700 pesos Mexicanos y aunque la descripción dice que te dan 90 días de garantía, es una MENTIRA, la pila del celular no dura, lo tengo que estar cargando varias veces al día y cuando me comuniqué para solicitar la devolución, me dijeron que no podían hacer nada, que me comunicara a Samsung para solicitar la garantía, lo cual es una estupidez, la garantía de fábrica ya expiró, es un producto USADO, si no van a dar los 90 días, mejor no pongan nada, el vendedor es GECV Electronics y no hay forma de contactarlo desde la plataforma de Amazon.

The phone was NOT totally wiped from previous Vendor (Sprint),"When I tried initially to insert a new SIM, it showed some issues, had to work with my USA Mobile supplier for hours to get it to work, that's the bad part, eventually -after 5 hours of technical support, we got it to work.<br>The good part: the phone is basically brand new, no issues cosmetically or technologically that I can see or experience, it's perfect once the new Sim card is activated and the new Mobile network is updated.It also updated to Android 11, with no issues, however, it shuts down intermittently after using it for 2 weeks .The Amazon (Reliable Cellular)vendor did not reply, even after 48 hours, so don't expect to get support, if the phone was defective I would have made a major issue with Amazon, thankfully it is ok. Beware that the previous mobile software and mobile locks are erased BEFORE you insert your new Sim card.When I added 128 SD extra memory to be able to download my music, the card appears to not be able to be written to, intermittent problem, after speaking to the vendor, they promised to look into this when the phone is returned. So far (now 1 week later) the refund HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED. This vendor has a Canadian drop off depot in Calgary, I am in Toronto, had to pay $20 for special registered delivery to Calgary, the Vendor DID NOT specify this little detail during the return instructions, totally unacceptable return procedure, avoid this Vendor for ""renewed"" cell phones shipped to Canada from the USA.</br>",2021年7月9日 在加拿大审核
Vale la pena?,"-------Update 6 de mayo 2020---------La cámara se puso en un estado peor que antes. Ahora se escucha un clic cuando alguna app quiere acceder a la cámara (incluso la app de la cámara). La cámara se tarda en responder a pesar de que reinicie el celular y borre la caché de la camara. Era un gran teléfono ): ya incié el proceso de devolución.--------------------------------------------En cuanto llegó el celular me percaté de que el cargador no era original (he visto vídeos de copias chinas) y efectivamente el cargador solo sirvió una vez y el cable era de la peor calidad posible. A pesar de eso, decidí darle una oportunidad a este teléfono. Lo usé un par de minutos y lo actualicé por completo pero me dí cuenta que la parte trasera no estaba bien. Parece que abrieron el teléfono y ya no les dio tiempo de cerrarlo correctamente. Por esta parte, dudo que tenga la protección IP68 y no me atrevo a sumergirlo.Aun así, todo funcionó perfecto... hasta que abrí la cámara ):Al usarla por primera vez, parecía ir bien pero cuando abrí el modo x2 se empezó a congelar excesivamente al punto de que tenia que cerrar la cámara y volverla a iniciar pero después de unas cuantas fotos se pasmaba de nuevo ): Igualmente noté problemas con otras apps que usan la cámara, por ejemplo, whatsapp o un escaner, que decían tener error al abrir la cámara o abrían la cámara totalmente desenfocada sin oportunidad de enfocar. Tenía que cerrar la app y volverla a abrir para que funcionara de forma correcta. Al momento de esta review parece que encontré la solución a este problema. Haré update si funciona al 100%.Estos fueron los pequeos grandes detalles que encontré en este teléfono. Todo lo demás funciona de maravilla: WiFi, NFC, Carga inalambrica, Bluetooth, micrófonos, bocinas, sensor de huellas, batería, flash, lector de ritmo cardiaco, etc...Me quedaré este teléfono un par de días más a ver cómo se desenvuelve.",2020年4月29日 在墨西哥审核

"Phone faulty, just out of revised warrantee","Four months after receipt, the screen area around the fingerprint reader became intermittently unresponsive.It sometimes starts working properly after a cache clear, but soon goes back to its evil ways.The phone is essentially unusable, and the seller says it's out of their 90-day warrantee, and I'm outta luck.Looking into the config, it seems this was originally an Australian phone, which Samsung Canada confirmed when I called for help: they said they don't support my model variant. even just tech support.I assume Amazon stands by their seller but that's s a little odd.Be careful, because the hardware may not be supported by the manufacturer locally.And their 90 day clearly isn't enough: if the thing is renewed to ""as-new,"" why not a full year?",2020年6月19日 在加拿大审核

"Cumplen con lo que prometen, pero hasta ahí!","Para empezar debo aclarar que compre los equipos con Chubbiestech. Y la verdad es que las dos veces me llegaron equipos con una estética de 9, si tenían un pequeo raspón en el cromo de la cámara, o un rayoncito en los laterales pero nada más.Te llega el celular en una caja genérica, con un cargador y cable de muy baja calidad, por lo que toca invertir en un buen cargador y cable, pero la verdad no hay quejas por ese lado.Los dos equipos llegaron desbloqueados y en México agarraron la red 4.5g.Ahora, el tema más controvertido es la batería, dicen que los celulares mínimo llegan con el 80% de vida de la batería y en ocasiones así es, un equipo de los dos que compre tenia justo el 82% de vida. Pero en otras ocasiones te llega un celular con un 95% de batería lo cual es excepcional para ser un celular ya con aos de desgaste.En resúmen, cumplen con lo que prometen, y es un buen ahorro aún en 2022!",2022年5月28日 在墨西哥审核
Updated review:,"Waited more than 10 days for the phone to just ship, then when it did arrive it was AT&amp;T locked, which means that I cannot update it and I'm stuck with having 10+ AT&amp;T bloatware apps that cannot be uninstalled. (one of them is half a GB!) Have to return it now.However, the condition of the phone was very good. I could only notice a few faint marks on the back, and the screen was basically new.It came in a generic box but inside it had the original Samsung charging brick, cable, USB-C to USB adapter, sim eject tool, and AKJ Earbuds. All of them were packaged in small plastic bags and haven't been opened. I don't know if I just got lucky or if everyone received them... also for those wondering mine did not have the plastic screen protector that is usually included with Samsung phones.Update:Just received the replacement phone (very early!). This time it is actually factory unlocked and I could update it. Condition of the phone was like new apart from some dust or something around the Earpiece. Unfortunately this time it arrived without any accessories except the Samsung charger but that doesn't matter too much. (Still no screen protector either in case your wondering). I'll update my review to 3 stars because of the inconveniences.Overall satisfied but it took some time.Update (2): Seems like the charging brick and/or cable they sent is defective and heavily used, need to buy a new one. Not too big of a deal but still inconvenient. Lowered to 2 stars.",2021年8月27日 在加拿大审核

BUYER BEWARE!!!  Phone was neither Canadian nor unlocked,"When I received the phone I was very happy with the condition. It was immaculate and everything seems to be as stated.

After speaking with an Amazon representative I decided to return the merchandise. The problem was when I attempted to return the merchandise it was not an option that was available. So at this point I am stuck with a phone but I cannot use and cannot return. Luckily Amazon being a very fair company provided me with a full refund which I appreciated very much.<br>I am writing this review was a warning for anyone buying from this company.

save your money,"I bought identical volts for my wife and i because it seemed like a good price for a smart phone. Within the first month both phones crashed repeatedly and would freeze up during the most remedial tasks, such as checking the time ect. Both phones now have to be restarted atleast 4 times daily so they can atleast bring the keyboard up in under 3 minutes. I am a heavy user and my wife barely uses hers for anything other than phone calls. And they both have the same issues. We are getting other phones just incase we might actually have to use them in an emergency, we won't have to reboot the phone to call someone. Navigating the phone is a nightmare due to the slow pace and the phone sometime freaks out and takes you where it wants you to go and you have to reboot before it will stop.

So disappointing,"I am so disappointed. This phone has to be the most difficult phone I have ever had. I replaced my Samsung galaxy rush for this one as I needed more space and apps to handle my business. It wont even let me dial a number without tapping the keys at least five times each. In addition, I am now thinking that it is refurbished which was not marked as such. The pros is the size weight and features that it has if they worked, in addition it has a lot more space for the apps I need and I could even print to my printer which is a plus. I will keep searching for the right one, but in all honesty I don't have time for this and I don't want to pay 600,00 for the phone that i really want. Ugggh",2014年10月19日 在美国审核

"Very good phone, so-so carrier","Would have been a much higher rating for the phone without Boost Mobile.Getting my number transferred to Boost was much, much harder than it should have been.Took over a day and only because I chased after it.Boost has a lot of things wrong with their system.And I don't like that Boost charges extra just to use the phone as a hotspot, when I already have more time in the plan than I will ever use to cover the data usage.The coverage so far has been good, but I don't travel much.On to the phone.It has a nice screen, clear and sharp.Not ""Retina"" sharp,but sufficient for real use.The phone is responsive, both with the touch screen and for performance.A more expensive phone might be smoother, but this is fast enough that I doubt I'd notice much difference.The phone isn't thin, but with the protective case, it has a nice feel in my hand.The size is very good for me and I think it would be for most people.The battery life isn't quite as good as advertised, but it stands up to heavy use, even on-line.I've yet to drain the battery below 50%, even if I'm on the Internet a lot.The quality of the 3G/4G signal is fairly variable, even when standing still.That could be the phone, Boost or a combination.But I can get streaming video with minimal stuttering in the basement where I work, a notoriously bad place for signals.It does switch automatically to an available WiFI signal, so that helps.The call quality is generally good, but I suppose that's typical now for even a mid-line phone.One surprise is that I can still make calls when no bars show and for the most part the call remains stable.It takes nice photos and video, but low light conditions make it very grainy.Of course, the lens is tiny, as must be the image sensor.So the quality is OK, considering.One point to mention is that the OS is KitKat.It seems to work very well on the phone, but be aware that Google changed the way external memory is accessed.Only apps written specifically for the OS can readily write to an external SD card (i.e., the one you add to the phone).Many apps may not updated.It's isn't an issue for me, since I don't really have that many apps installed (unlike my tablet).But if you want to use an app you install and that will need access to substantial amounts of storage, make sure it can write to the external in KitKat.The phone itself only has about 3 GB available.Note that the apps on phone don't seem to have any issues writing to the external, which makes sense.All-in-all, I'd say it's a excellent phone for the price.The jury is still out on Boost Mobile.But suffice it to say I'm already considering finding a new carrier.",2014年10月24日 在美国审核
"TLDR: Phone was great initially, then it took a downturn.","Alright, where to begin? Let me preface this with the fact I've had the phone for going on 11 months now. When I first saw the specs on this thing I was salivating at the price point. Quad core processor? 8GB memory? High end battery? Couldn't convince me a phone was better when I was shopping around. But as with most things like this it eventually starts having issues.You notice right off the bat that the already low 1 gig of RAM is clogged up about 70% of Boost Mobile crap you can't uninstall without rooting it. I have only rooted once and it was pre-done for me. So I chose to operate with all the floofy crap loaded on it. Well being as there isnt enough RAM to run fully, I cant be listening to music while surfing a website and texting someone. Typically it will cut off my music to my annoyance to allow me to surf the web. Not like it pauses, it completely exits the app and I have to back out and reopen it to listen again. This also makes the phone run very sluggish now with all of my personal stuff on it. I transferred everything possible to my SD card, but this doesnt help with RAM, just storage.Another issue is the battery. Sure when you first get it it seems like an awesome battery. And I ran it dry and charged it only when needed like you're supposed to... It didnt stay a good battery more than a couple of months. Now i have to charge it when i get home from work if i want to used it in the evening at all. Very annoyingI also have a weird liquid defect under the screen. Its like a bubble is trapped in the dead center, it follows movement of the finger if you press the screen then quickly goes back after release. Its not much of an issue unless its sunny outside.Then it clearly shows it like a stain over the screen. May have something to do with moisture with heavy humidity in Texas.And last, but certainly not least, the keyboard issue. This happens in texts, google, facebook, whatever that i possibly could type on. The keyboard seems like the phone is overloaded and cant handle it. When i click on the area to type, it pulls up the screen like the text box should be there, only its not. Its just blank wit ha blinking type indicator teasing me. Then the keyboard pops up! I get maybe a word or 2 in, then it disappears again and im stuck with a misspelled word and a half a sentence, have to wait again for it to come up. Now sometimes it works the whole text, but a lot of times it does this. Trust me its annoying, its as bad as watching a YouTube video that buffers every 5-10 seconds, yea i know, brutal.Anyways, the last 2 started about 9 months in, if thats the value youre looking for then this is perfect. But seeing as the average phone can last 4.7 years in todays day and age, im at 11 months and shopping for a new phone. Take it as you want",2016年1月7日 在美国审核
"LG phone is plain but works and provides adequte Android experience. Boost is marginal, depending on your needs. Shop carefully.","Decent phone for the money. Locked to Boost only. I kinda like the phone. I have switched providers (and phones of course) because off the interstate or away from big cities you have no service. We travel out west and lose coverage in much of Oklahoma and Kansas, etc. Boost is a pretty good deal if you don't stray away from their coverage areas. When I switched the phone out I tried to transfer over my phone number and found that Boost doesn't provide users with an account number. When I got email from them they referenced phone ending in account number, and then provided the last four digits of the phone number. So I conjectured that my account number was my phone number. It isn't. It isn't even close. The account number is a random collection of nine digits. You don't have access to your account number anywhere without contacting an agent. You can't get an agent over a regular phone line (impossible), so if you're out of a service area you can't speak to Boost at all. The only way to get your account number is through 611 on the phone and even then they want to put you through 20 questions before they provide it. Like satellite tv people. So decent enough phone if you don't travel much or travel only on the interstate and they (Sprint) provide towers in your area. I also got coverage blocked now and again, even from Sprint towers. Other providers are easier to talk to and the costs are really pretty close for the same data package. Shop around carefully and please note coverage area maps.",2016年8月22日 在美国审核
"Slow, horrible battery life, laughably little storage","I got this phone because it was cheap and it was on a monthly plan. In retrospect, I probably should have waited until I could afford something better. It has been alright, but over time it got more and more sluggish and the battery life got more and more atrocious. And don't even get me started on the storage. It has laughably little storage, which I thought would be ok because of my microSD card. How wrong I was. First of all, you have to have enough space on your normal memory to download the app. So even if you have 5GB left on your microSD but none of your normal, it won't let you download. This would be ok if you could move all of your apps to the SD card, but not all apps let you do that for some reason. So I am constantly scanning my apps to see if they are absolutely mission critical or not. OH and the spamware is AWFUL. Most of it you can't get rid of and you can't move it to your microSD so that takes a ton of memory as well. And the default launcher sucks, so when you first turn it on you'll be like ""GAH what the heck?! This sucks!!"" But at least you can fix that part with the Google Now launcher.Conclusion: Do not buy. Ever.-A Thomas Burgess Review",2015年8月18日 在美国审核
The competition's grass is not always greener,"A surprisingly good phone for the money (even if I did pay too much.) Priced at $59 on Amazon (I paid $149 at Best Buy), you won't be disappointed. It's fast, has an acceptable screen resolution and one of the best batteries among cell phones (at any price.) Although Boost/Sprint coverage generally can't compare to Verizon or AT&amp;T, if you live in or near major urban areas, you should be fine. Works great in Chicago, DC, and even Green Bay/Door Co, WI. I did have bad reception INDOORS in DC but, as I'm rarely there, I can live with it. Having said that, I considered Verizon Prepaid recently since they finally offer 4G. Forget it. Verizon Prepaid is NOT the same as Verizon contract service. (For instance, in Door Co., WI, I would be ROAMING with only 3G for data. And it costs more for 1/5 the data... So, I guess I'll live with Boost.

"good phone, can't transfer apps to sd card, bad camera, clear and bright colors/screen, loud speakers. good call quality","First of all, NEVER EVER give your credit card info to Boost Mobile.After 2 years of doing the prepaid cards, they lured me in to autopay with a $30/month plan.I've heard horror stories about credit cards, but figured they'd fix it by now, WRONG.They screwed me over big time, overcharged me, told me to dispute it, then suspended my account after I disputed it, and after 2 weeks of constant emails, phone calls, msgs, NOTHING was fixed after they did all this.So now after being a loyal customer, I've switched to Verizon.This phone was good for only 6 months, now it's all glitched up, slow, the keyboard is the worst with it popping up and down, and not being responsive.The worst is internal memory.You can't transfer apps to your sd card.It says you can, but really it doesn't.Good thing is the big screen,bright colors, 2 loud speakers on the bottom which is a total positive in terms of placement, sound, loudness, and quality.The camera sucks though.Pictures are so awful on here I never really feel like taking pictures on it.Front camera is even worse.The shutter button is slow, good luck capturing that perfect moment.It does have HDR on it which I just found out, not sure if it was always there, an update, or what not since I rarely use it as a camera.It has panorama as well which is great.I currently have an LG Transpyre.The LG Volt beats this big time.I wish Verizon had better prepaid phones.Overall great phone, loud speakers, bright colors, calls come in loud and clear, great until you use up the memory.",2015年8月28日 在美国审核
Works well for the price.,"I got this phone about two months ago and it works pretty well.Added an Sd card and was super happy that I could actually transfer apps to the SD card (old phone could not do this) so I have plenty of memory.Works pretty snappy.I was having an issue where when I'd exit an app I'd bet a black wallpaper but I think that might have been an app issue not a phone issue.The rear facing camera is absolute crap (worse than my old phone) and while the screen is nice and crisp when I take a forward facing pic, the pic always comes out a lil fuzzy.Not sure what that's about.A lil disappointed because I was hoping for a better camera (hate lugging my big camera around) but I got it at a great price, it has a bigger screen and works faster than my old one.Call quality and speaker is good.I often have no bars showing for signal but am able to make clear calls without issue so don't know what's up with that.Overall, good purchase.I hope it lasts awhile but since I got it at a good price if it dies after a year I won't be too disappointed.Lg's warranty is also kinda pathetic.made me not want to buy the phone but I did anyway.hopefully I won't have an issue.I'd recommend it.",2015年1月31日 在美国审核
worked GREAT for almost 3 weeks... then the phone stopped recognizing touch correctly,"Worked wonderfully for almost 3 weeks. And I mean it was great I LOVED it.Then one day the screen stopped working.And I have NOT dropped this or anything.I have baby'd this thing.Had it in a very protective case covering the front even since it was a fold over case.Not a scratch on this thing.When I try to swipe to open the screen, it thinks I'm tapping on it.It almost never recognizes touch correctly anymore other than just a tap.You CANNOT drag touch on this, it thinks you're just tap tap tapping along.I bought mine at the online retailer radio crack.I sent them an email from their website about getting it replaced but that was two days ago.I can't be without a working phone so I was forced to buy a much more expensive phone that has a better track record however, the S3.I'm on Boost Mobile.My wife has the S3 and it's held up for about 2 years, hoping the one I get stays solid, unlike my experience with the LG Volt.Too bad, it seems like LG picked some bad materials?If you search other sites or just google, you can find people saying similar things about the Volt about it not allowing them to drag anymore and hardly ever recognizing touch.For some reason I don't see many of those reviews here but I have found them elsewhere.If it was for some manufacture defect probably with the materials for this phone, it would be a killer phone.If it worked like it was DESIGNED to, it would be great.KUDOS to those who have the phone and it's working good for them.I thankfully only paid $30 for mine so even if I can't get it replaced for free it's not an outrageous loss.In fact due to all the bad reviews I've seen on other sites and FORUMS (look there you will see what I mean) I was VERY hesistant to get this phone, but when I saw I could get it for $30 I thought WHY NOT.I even tried doing factory resets, downloading the image directly to my PC and doing a totally new factory download.It just doesn't work anymore.I was super excited that I got a killer phone for $30..... then it died.I don't think I will EVER do a budget phone again.Just can't take the risk, I use my phones for working and I have to be able to use them in the field.",2014年12月27日 在美国审核
"Little miracle phone, more user friendly than the S5","Fantastic for the price and the phone service--I originally was trying out the S5 on Verizon and had nothing but a terrible experience with the service. So I discovered this little gem, and even though it's not a fancy Samsung, I learned that LG is elegant and cool. I love all the little effects, how easy it is to get access to my messages, voice search, maps, etc just by swiping the top down. The screen is about as big as the S3, and it has a sharp and snappy response time. Most importantly it's got an 8mpx camera, which for 80 bucks is quite the steal. My only problem is just not having the Swype feature, and apparently I'm going to need my friend to root the phone and input Swype manually.

It's not all that. But Good.,"This is an ok phone, the main problem being all the bloatware.

Comes with 1gb. this can cause the phone to lag. Not badly, but sometimes pretty noticeable.Screen is sub HD, around 580p or so.Screen shows smudges and definitely wouldn't take a hard fallFrequent freezes, and some apps can be hard to get to work probably, especially speech to text on your keyboard.Horrible speakers (headphones which most use) sound good.Other than that for the price is is a good deal, I decided to go with the Kyocera Hyrdo Icon, because of it's near indestructible build quality, also has great battery life. Super loud speakers, water resistant 30 minutes in up to 3.5 feet of water. Scratch resistant, dust, military grade build. I'm not accident prone but I took it over this for the fact of ""just in case"". It's like a patio brick compared to the build of the LG. But for the price the Volt does have more features. But the Kyocera slightly faster because it has 1.5gb of RAM, not 1gb. And that extra 500mb makes it snappier, I tried the LG for almost a week, and just wasn't liking it. The one TERRIBLE thing about the Kyocera Icon is the call quality, especially on MSync. Very low, and robotic, but no one has a problem hearing me. So that's ok, it sounds good enough. Some calls are louder than others btw.This is a GOOD phone, just not for me. Also I like to have things most people don't have (or buy). Enjoy!!",2014年11月9日 在美国审核
Good for two months until some MAJOR issues erupted with it (Updated to 7 month review),"I have had this phone since Black Friday of last year, so I've had it for two months now. I don't like the reviews of people who just got their phones, because it's no real way for us to see how an item stands up to long usage. So, here we go.Pros:-This thing had AMAZING battery life for a smartphone. I am a moderate user, so I can go sometimes two to three days before needing to charge the phone.-Call quality is very clear. I had an LG Venice before this phone and the call quality really sucked on that phone but this one is crisp and clear.-I usually use strictly wifi as I don't like using my wireless data, yet when I do use it, when I'm in 4G compatible areas, it's SUPER fast.-Screen size is nice. It's not as massive as some of the other phones out so it fits easily in the pocket, even with a case on it. And it's not so small as to make using the onscreen keyboard hard.-The power button is on the side of the device, so once you get used to the placement, you will find a lot easier to use than those ones that use the top of the phone for power button placement.Cons:-Being on the Sprint network, it's really bad cell-reception in rural areas (which there is a ton near where I live).-It doesn't have a lot of free space, but it's not that big an issue since you get a microsd slot.Now with that big said, I have run into a MAJOR issue with the phone over the past couple of days and is the result of it being 3 stars instead of 5.Several times throughout the day, everything on the phone has become unresponsive. Try to get into an app and it shows a black screen for a minute. Reboots if you try to use multiple apps in a row. Won't allow you to dial phone numbers or text. Won't allow you to use apps that have been moved to the microsd slot, claiming they aren't installed. The microsd card doesn't even show to be mounted in the device.Text messages won't show up until it decides to sort itself out. Rebooting causes the screen to become devoid of all icons when it comes back on. I've had to factory reset the phone because of how bad it's getting, so I hope it will do the trick. If it doesn't I think I may be forced to get myself a new phone entirely.Update 5/17/15:I've had the phone for now 7 months. This is what my phone is like now: The phone remains very much the same, but now several new issues have arisen.Now, the phone half the time doesn't bring up the keyboard. The other half the time, the keyboard only stays up for a few words before it disappears and you won't be able to bring it back up. The camera also doesn't like staying on. Many times you push the button to take a pic, it will make a snapping sound, but won't capture any pic.In short, the phone only gets worse.",2015年1月29日 在美国审核
Nice starter smart phone or upgrade to older smart phone,"I bought this phone 3 weeks ago from a local big box store and got the 1 gig no contract plan.After three weeks here is what I think of it.ProsLarge Screen. Uses latest Kit Kat Android OS. Easy to read outside if you have brightness at highest level. Has 8 gig of internal memory which is enough for a non-power user (limits number of apps you can have on the phone) plus you can put in a SD card to expand data storage (Photos, movies, etc).Sound quality of calls is good. Speed of the phone is good. The camera takes fine pictures inside and out.NOT quality camera pictures, but fine snap shots.Battery life is two days if you use it lightly, maybe a little more. Charges back up in two hours or so. Battery is removable so you can carry a spare if you wanted to.Back comes off with some effort and stays on well.Generally nice build quality for a plastic phone.Looks nice. There are many cases available for the phone.ConsLarge phone, too big for most shirt pockets. While the case selection is okay, many of the cases look just like the others, so your choices are more limited than for the more 'famous/popular"" phones.OtherCoverage is limited to Sprint network (same for Virigin Mobile model) which means you get Sprint coverage.Could be very good, good, average or bad depending on your location.Verify what you get in your area. Generally very good along interstate highways and large towns, not so good in rural areas.$35 Data plans are okay if you don't use a lot of web stuff. If you do use lots of data, move up to the 5 gig plan. Customer service is fine, nothing to get excited about but they can answer your questions and they do call you back.

Worthy of my money!,"I purchased this phone because I needed the 4.7 inch display to see things a little better.Recently upgraded from the Moto G which boasted a 4.5 inch display, but the drawback about the G is that the home buttons is incorporated into the display.Thus, the user loses .6 of the viewing area, which comes to about 4.1 in actuality.Although the Volt operates on the Kitkat 4.4.2 OS, the G recently upgraded to the 4.4.4.Truthfully, could not see that much difference between the two systems, except that for the Moto G, the appearances for some of its apps changed somewhat.And... the G ran just a little bit faster.Irregardless, I use a memory cleaner to help keep things clean whenever I'm done surfing the web or downloading apps.Weight wise, the Volt is lighter to hold than my old G, both have a protective case installed.The Volt of course is slightly wider than the G, but still, am able to hold it in one hand while scrolling or typing.And the Volt is about .1 to .2 of an inch longer, but still, no problems holding onto it.Between the Volt and my old Moto G, I just love the way the Volt performs.Of course, the larger display is a bigger plus in my book, since I am getting the full 4.7 inch viewing area, not feeling like I'm being gipped.Battery life is great on the Volt, and I like the fact that it has an option to view the battery level without having to install an app to monitor it.And of course, I love the fact that most of the apps I downloaded onto the Volt could be moved onto the SD card, to free up space in the internal memory.Too bad most of the installed apps can't be moved onto the SD card, although, if you wanted to, you could delete them to free up even more space on the internal memory.My wife has the Volt from Boost's sister company (VM), and both phones (hers and mine), perform almost identical.The only difference I noticed is with the notification light.On her phone, the light constantly flashes to alert the user of messages received, whereas mine flashes in a sequence of two bursts every 3 to 4 seconds.Another little annoyance I observed is the sensitivity of the power button.Whenever I pull the phone out of my pocket, one of my fingers is always hits the power button, and after its removed from the pocket, the home screen is smiling at me.This could lead to premature battery drainage since the phone can be accidentally turned on constantly without the user's knowledge, especially if the phone is situated in a tight pants or purse pocket.I also installed another text messaging app simply because the one that I downloaded, has a pop up window that appears when the phone is asleep or is on the home screen.It's easier then having to scroll down the task bar to access the SMS screen to read messages.The stock messaging app on the Volt has that feature also, but it only appears briefly, unless you're quick enough to tap on it to read your messages.Have not experienced any problems with making and receiving calls.But... I wish that the audio output while in speakerphone mode was a little more louder.I work in a noisy environment so can't use the speakerphone mode too often.Listening to music without headphones or earbuds is awesome though, too bad phone calls weren't as loud as the music.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核

Even after moderate daytime talk and text I have never gone below 50% battery use. This phone does freeze up every now and then and I just remove the battery and put it back in and it's good as new.

Best phone i owned yet!! This phone is great! Great price,"I have had this phone for a week now. I love this phone! I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Rush. The speeds on the phone are great. The swiping and use of the phone itself is very easy to use. The 4g/LTE is great to have. The apps i use run great on this phone. The picture quality is very crisp! Has a micro sd slot for extra memory. The sound and volume are great as well as using speaker. I was ready to buy this phone at $130 here on Amazon only to come back when i was ready to buy, and saw it on sale for $80...Best phone for under $100 you will find!! If its still on sale...Jump on it!!",2014年10月1日 在美国审核
Better off spending money on a more higher end phone.,"I had this for about little over a year with Sprint prepaid. Let me say you're better off spending a bit more money on another phone with better specs. It barely picked up any LTE signal. No 4g signal at all.Plus if you are using an app the keyboard won't pop up since you're using a lot of ram using the app. All the ram space in this phone wasn't big enough for my usage.This phone is great if you're only going to use it to text and call. Any more then that, spend more money on a better phone.One thing I did like is how long the battery was, only when I set it up to cdma mode. If I set it to LTE my battery is going to be gone in less then a day with the phone heating up.On top of that GPS sucks big time. I could never navigate any where.Please just don't get this phone.",2016年5月24日 在美国审核
Crappiest Phone EVER!,"This has been, by far, the s***tiest phone I have ever had in my entire life.That includes my 1st cell phone ever, my beloved Kyocera that was before smart phones.I have been late for work twice (yes, shame on me) because the alarms are just not reliable at ALL.I have had calls, texts and voicemails just never come through.I have had my own calls/texts/voicemails never go where they are sent (I know these could be service issues, but don't get me started on Boost).No app space, what-so-ever.I have had apps randomly go missing.I have had it NOT call emergency services in an emergency....it just sits on the call screen with a turning loading circle.Thank god I am still alive.There are always crashing apps and programs randomly while it's just sitting there and let's not get into how many times it just restarts itself for no good reason. It is notorious for being on but not letting you press anything.And now, finally, after ONE HORRIBLE YEAR, it has died. I used to love LG.Never again an LG and never again Boost.I take very good care of my phones and clean them out monthly so to have all these problems just blows my mind. You people should be ashamed of yourselves.I will take pride in throwing this thing into a brick wall over and over when my new phone comes in.",2016年1月15日 在美国审核

Phone pretty much activated it self. But any who those who have the monthly plans or the $3 a day; your Volt is only compatible with the $3/day or $55/mo plan.

Love this phone enough to have purchase four,"I been on Sprint ever since I had a cellphone and I went from Sprint to Virgin Mobile with a LG Volt and now I'm on Boost with a LG Volt. I originally went to Virgin because of the $35 plan but I needed more minutes then I thought I could live with, so since Boost had a plan that would suite me better for the money I switched. So I guess I will still be on Sprint a little longer.I liked the the white Lg Volt because I've always had a black or gray phone and the white one was refreshing.I sold a mint condition Galaxy Note 2 which payed for 2 Volts, screen savers and 3 cases with cash left over to pay for the first months service.This phone is really nice but it could be a tad bit bigger especially coming from a Note.The thing with the Boost vs Virgin Volt is that it doesn't allow apps to sd card, other then that and the color it's the same. I like the nice bright clear screen which looks good to me regardless of the resolution. It's fast, thin, light weight with a nice big battery that will last days with normal use.This is one energizer phone if you care about battery life...I now judge my phone purchases by the battery life. I had a galaxy Note with a month old battery and this will run circles around it in terms of battery life. Make sure you go through the setting and make adjustment to certain apps like mail, gps, etc to get the best battery life.Unlike Samsung phones this phone has lots of useful features that I actually will use unlike the Samsung phone which I turn off most if not all of them.For the money you get most the features of the feature of the flagship phones, in a IR blaster, KItKat at a 1/4 of the price.I brought four Volts for less than the price of a iPhone or Galaxy S5.I would highly recommend this phone for anyone on Boost or Virgin Mobile.",2014年9月14日 在美国审核

Avoid Boost Mobile like the plague!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I decided to write this review for two reasons:(1) To warn everyone about Boost Mobile, and (2) Hoping that someone might have the same problem I am having now and can provide some help.This review concerns my whole Boost Mobile experience.Here goes!I purchased the phone because Boost Mobile has a great $35 unlimited talk, text, and web (2.5 Gb at high-speed 4G LTE) and Hotspot capability for $5 for 1 Gb of data (in addition to the phone's allocation).I went to the Boost Mobile website, created my account, and activated the phone.The phone appeared to work OK, but the data was only 3G.I called Boost Mobile customer service.I have to warn you... the 800 number is nothing short of voice-mail hell!!The options given only run you in a circle.You can talk to a customer service agent only if you want to ""add a service.""All other options are just information that never leads you to a real person.Once you reach a customer service agent, you must be able to speak Filipino-ish.You will NOT (even if you demand it) be able to speak with a Customer Service Supervisor in the United States!!No matter how much you scream at the Filipino operator.It's not going to happen!!!The first agent told me that the $35 plan would only provide 3G data.I told him, ""According to your website, the service is 4G LTE until 2.5 Gb and then slows to 3G speeds.""He told me that the site was wrong.I hung up and called another operator (wading through voice-mail hell again).This operator spoke clearer English and told me the first operator was wrong.I did all of the normal ""reboot"" and ""refresh"" crap with nothing helping the situation.I finally gave up, wiped my information, and took the phone back to the store.Oh well, another surprise was to be had.The phone can't be returned once activated!NICE!!Since I had already paid for one month of service, I decided to ""reboot"" and ""refresh"" the phone.Still 3G!!I did notice that the phone would show five bars for 20 seconds and then zero bars with a red ""x.""It would cycle through this 3G, five bars, no bars with a red ""x"" about every minute.When out and about, the phone would do the same thing.I felt that the phone having reception and losing reception was a bit dangerous... after all, most of us have our phones for emergencies while we travel!!Finally, I found an option to switch the phone to CDMA only.This keeps service at all times and the ""off and on"" information mentioned above stops.Also, I had to turn the ""Connection Optimizer"" off in order to keep the phone from switching back to ""LTE/CDMA"" mode.Remember that I mentioned that I purchased the phone for hot spot use?Well, if I log into my account, the hot spot are ""grayed out.""A banner near the hot spot information says ""Options are grayed out because account is in restricted status.""Nobody (and I mean NO ONE) at Boost Mobile can tell me what this means, why it's on my screen, and why I can't add hot spot service!!!!Apparently there is no Filipino-ish translation for ""restricted status.""I have to add that I went to a local Boost Mobile store.I should have known there was a problem when I walked up to the store and noticed the bars on the windows!!:)I felt like I was stepping into a third-world country when I walked in the store! ha ha ha haThe person there told me the phone was broken and it should have been receiving 4G data.Hmmm....Perhaps this ""expert"" is not really an expert at all!!He made the diagnosis with the phone in CDMA mode.I would have thought he would have checked the mode FIRST!!Oh well, who am I?Certainly no Boost Mobile LG Volt expert! :)So, now I have a beautiful phone that can't do the two things I purchased it to do!!I would stay away from this company.The lack of any customer service and ability to resolve problems has turned me against the company!!I could have purchased the same phone (LG Realm - 3G only) for $70 less than I paid for this phone!!!!!You have been warned!!!:)",2015年3月26日 在美国审核

"Some features don't work, Bloatware, HORRIBLE Customer Service","I've had this phone just long enough to NOT be able to return it.Although it is fast (though slowing with a few apps) and call quality is good, I am getting very frustrated with it.First, speakers are really terrible and very distorted at higher volumes.Second, the phone comes pre-loaded with lots of unremovable bloatware.LG's File Manager ONLY allows you to connect with Dropbox.I haven't found another file manager that works.It comes with Lumen Toolbar (bloat) - can't uninstall it.Voice Mate (Siri clone) doesn't work worth a darn.I am also unable to stop the phone from vibrating in the middle of the night for notifications without also turning off phone calls.Why being able to customize notifications is such a big deal is beyond me.But what is really infuriating and making me change this review to a one star is the absolutely ABYSMAL CUSTOMER SERVICE.Days and hours of trying to find out why I am unable to connect my phone with Bluetooth or what LG calls ""Mobile Storage"" (should be able to access your phone through your wi-fi router).There is nothing on web about this.Many, many emails to Boost and LG, chatting, phone calls, led me to an LG technician who said, ""It's probably something simple"", but I'll just have to plug my phone via usb.On top of that I had had every representative from Boost and LG tell me too plug my phone in with a usb cord whenever I brought up the issue of the phone not making a wireless connection.LG and BOOST are misrepresenting their products or I have a broken phone (How would I even know?)There is no support from Boost.Reps from both companies didn't even know what I was talking about when I ask about the ""Wireless Storage"" feature.Boost's customer service was never stellar, but it is useless now.I have two LG tv's and was thinking about buying a Miracast dongle, but can't imagine that it would even work or the hours it would take to get it to work just wouldn't be worth the trouble.The phone does have a remote control for your TV's which I thought was kind of neat and it works, but I find it's still easier to just use the remote that came with my TV.I am actually thinking of downgrading my phone, between Google and phone manufacturer's, I don't even know if my phone is broken or not.Apparently Google Kit Kat is having issues with you moving files to your sd card - I did.I really wanted to phone to make things easier, but I'm finding the hours needed to try and get it to do what it is supposed to do just isn't worth it.",2014年6月26日 在美国审核

Republic Wireless is also the Sprint network but is only $27 per month. My old Net10 phone which was on the AT&amp;T network would also get service and roam. I called Boost to find out why my phone would not roam and they said that Boost does not roam because it is a no contract network.

Great phone!,"I have only been using this phone for a few days so far, but I have tweaked all the settings and checked out all of the features. My previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, so I skipped a few generations in between there. The S5 Active is definitely a huge improvement over the S2!My only disappointment with this phone, and it is very minor, is that I had thought the black bumpers around the edges were going to be more rubberized. They are not. They are hard, matte plastic. It makes me think that if it were to hit the ground hard enough, those black pieces would crack. I will probably end up buying a case of some sort, just for a little extra protection.There are way more good things about this phone though! The battery life seems to be amazingly good. The first day I got it, I charged it up the whole way and then spent about 10 hours straight transferring pictures and videos via Bluetooth. I was also using it for texting, using the browser and making calls and tweaking the settings. By the time I was done with all of that, the battery life was only down to about 70%. I didn't charge it again til late the next evening when it finally got down to about 22% after using it all that next day. That is a remarkable improvement over my last phone! I haven't noticed this phone to get hot or even warm at all, even after 2 hour conversations or web use or playing games for long periods of time. Just using Google maps and navigation on my old phone would turn it into a serious heat source and drain the battery quickly. That stuff doesn't happen with this S5 Active.The screen size is great. Bigger than my last phone, but not too big to feel to bulky and you don't feel like you're talking on a tab. The display is beautiful and I can definitely tell the difference from the S2. Everything is so crisp and clear, with beautiful color.There are so many great features with this phone and they all work flawlessly. I won't go into too much detail about those since you can read all about them up in the product description, but I will mention a few of my favorites -Taking a screenshot by simply swiping the side of your hand over the screen. No more having hold multiple buttons at a time!Videos will pause when you look away from the screen so you don't miss anything and need to rewind.The screen stays on as long as your looking at it, and you can scroll by swiping your hand (hovering) over the screen.The camera is great and id say the best camera I have ever used on a phone so far. There are a lot of options for editing and taking pics and all pics turn out perfectly.The fitness tracker app that is pre installed looks to be very useful. I haven't started using that yet, but I plan to. I registered my info on it awhile and plan to get started with that soon. I think it will be beneficial.So far, I am loving this phone and all of the great features. I should mention that call quality is great as well, of course. If I think of anything else, or come across any bad experiences, I will be sure to come back and update.I came back to mention the battery life again. Even with heavy use, this battery is amazing! After 2 full days of fairly heavy web use, games, email, and texting, the battery only got down to 55% by the end of the second day - which was late at night. I think that is excellent.",2014年8月16日 在美国审核
Red Moon trading Co will take your money and run,"I ordered a phone from Red Moon trading Co that was described as ""in good condition with light scratches on the plastic"". The phone received not only had several deep scratches on the plastic but the gorilla glass had scratches. I could live with the scratches on the plastic since it is a used phone and they do not effect the functionality, but the scratches on the screen are quite annoying. The case was also missing pieces which was not noted anywhere before or after ordering the phone.After turning the phone on, the screen hardly works, it constantly flickers with different intensities and often gets stuck with different colors than should be showing. Like someone turned inverted colors on the screen. Typically a reboot will fix the color issue, but it is very annoying to restart the phone multiple times a day.Then there is the Red Moon Trading Co. customer service. Which is non-existent. Multiple messages were left and over a week has gone by with no response at all.Do yourselves a favor and get a used phone from a reputable source, that will stand behind the product delivered.

"For adventurers, cooks, or anyone around water frequently! Camera sucks compared to other smartphones.","Happy that I was able to buy this phone for over $100 cheaper than through my carrier. The back piece to this phone is insanely hard to take off compared to my old S4 Active. I guess it is made with a tighter seal to keep water out but I feel like I am going to break the thin plastic battery cover every time I need to take it off. The battery charging cover on the bottom of phoneis also sturdier compared to the S4 Active, but I'm hoping it doesn't break off after unhinging and rehinging it a couple times a day, every day.The phone does not feel like it even needs a case, the edges are bumper-like. It is definitely heavier than your average phone but worth it if it's waterproof. One thing I HATE about this phone is that I was expecting the camera to be better. There is a known problem with the focusing function. My camera will refuse to focus on things at random, and it becomes annoying after a while. I despise the camera on this, the only reason I upgraded from my S4 Active was to get a better MP camera and so I am completely let down. I do hope that Lollipop comes out for the S5 Active soon.The AT&amp;T and Samsung bloatware is also outrageous! It doesn't slow down the phone that much but rooting would be a great idea for someone who hates bloatware.",2015年2月12日 在美国审核

Worth the try!,It is definitely refurbished which is not specified but I should have assumed. The phone did not hold a charge for more than a couple of hours on power save mode. I was a bit devastated at first because I couldn't afford to go without a phone during the return process but decided to try to buy a battery before the hassle of a return. I bought a Yontex battery replacement (less than $15) and the phone holds a charge all day and works as if new so I have no complaints.,2018年2月11日 在美国审核
The preffered phone for active or clumsy users is the galaxy s5 ACTIVE.,"The galaxy s5 ACTIVE is by far the best cell phone I have had to date.I am somewhat clumsy and drop things easily. I was pleased to see a phone which is built to withstand some abuse.I own a galaxy tab so that has made the phone functions familiar.My complaint with the tab is that two of the three function buttons on the front are not actual buttons but are activated by touch.As I am constantly inadvertently swiping them while using the tablet I have found them to be a pain.In the active phone version all three function buttons are actually buttons which fixes that issue. They have changed the function of the first button and I preferred it as was originally and hope I can figure out how to reprogram it permanently.It is supposed to be more resistant to impact, water proof etc. but I have no intention of deliberately trying it out.I have purchased a case and screen protector to be on the safe side but this phone feels meater than the others so that may be redundant. It has always been my experience that phones should function as phones first and most importantly and that trying to turn them into everything under the sun is often a mistake.Let's face it there are excellent heart rate monitors and pedometers on the market sold for that sole purpose and it is unlikely that a cell phone can match their performance. The heart rate monitor was accurate enough when I checked it against a medical one. The pedometer is a waste unless you always carry your phone around.The ones that you wear on your ankle or wrist are far more accurate and easy to use. The fitness app/program which is heavily promoted requires an invasion of privacy I consider unacceptable plus it would take forever to keep it updated.This phone came preloaded with a bunch of apps installed which I neither want or would ever use.I am trying to uninstall them and so far there are a few that do not provide an uninstall option. I think the price you pay for the phone is a direct correlation to the amount of preloaded programing and your willingness to sign up for a 2 year contract.While I have little interest in all the bells and whistles, they are there for those who do want them.It may duplicate some of my existing tablet functions and those things like reading books, listening to music or recorded books are nice to have but if I want to take a beautiful picture it will be with my 35mms camera and not with my cell phone!The camera on the phone is superior to many other cell phones cameras but for a planned picture it would not be my first choice.It was nice to have that phone function as I took several pics of a funny bumper sticker through my cars window while stopped at a red light and after cropping the picture I could see what the bumper sticker said.But the best feature is that I can if I so desire turn off the bells and whistles thus extending the battery life and insuring I have what I really need, a working cell phone!I will update further after more usage but my initial impression is that this is the phone of choice particularly for people who are either active or clumsy or both.Update: The phone came with a set of in ear headphones with 2 additional sized ends which I did not look at closely.To my delight I found out last night that they are actually good headphones as they have an in line volume control and stop button.It is about 5 inches off one side but the controls are raised so it only took a little practice to get the feel of how to operate. It is my opinion that the failure to have that control makes most headphones a waste of time unless you are setting in a chair listening.While I walk my dogs I stop to talk to neighbors or traffic sounds change or if using inside I turn on the vacuum, etc. and I don't want to have to dig out my phone to change the volume or turn off the phone. I do have to get the phone out to turn it back on which is a shame. I received a phone call while listening to an audio book.It temporarily stopped the book and automatically restarted when I ended the call.These headphones would cost at least 20.00 with the inline controls so kudos to Samsung for providing them for free.",2014年9月23日 在美国审核
Nice features but charging port is busted,"Have used the phone for 3 weeks after buying it 5 weeks ago and the charging port is not working. Seems to be a common problem with Samsung phones. Repair looks like it is too comprehensive to do as you have to remove the screen and lcd. The repair shop stated that they would not do the repair unless they got $400 (labor, $170 for new screen and lcd, and 15 for charging port part) and suggested swapping out batteries and using a different charger for the batteries. Samsung would not warranty this as it was refurbished and the seller only offers a 30 day warranty which expired last week. Have not tried moving files via the usb port but assume that is broken as well. I have had HTC and LG phones and they have held up for the most part during the two year contracts I have had over the last 4 years. Buyer beware.",2015年2月15日 在美国审核
... this phone I intended to order one in the best condition possible,"When I went to order this phone I intended to order one in the best condition possible. Instead apparently because what I wanted was out of stock I was charged for one in ""fair"" condition instead. Generally I use a bluetooth to take calls on my phone. The first time I did left my bluetooth in the car and took a call I was greeted by a hissing scratchy sound accompanied with every word uttered. It sounded like I was standing on the other side of a machine that was grinding metal and the person was talking to me through an opening on the other side. Furthermore, previously I was using a phone that was so outdated that when I tried to download applications on Google Play they would tell me my phone wasn't. It was a Samsung Infuse. Yet even with it being so outdated there's places that I was getting text messages and was able to make calls that I'm not able to now. This makes no sense to me being that a Samsung Infuse to an S5 is like jumping from riding a bike to driving a Corvette. After contacting Amazon, even though this product is Amazon fulfilled they tell me I need to just pay full price for the other phone and then after I send the one I have back and everything is processed I'll get my money back. So I order a product, get the wrong thing, then I'm told buy the other one and I'll get my money back sometime down the road in the future? hmmmm........ well, I guess I need to rethink paying for the Amazon Prime renewal and doing my Christmas shopping on here",2015年11月15日 在美国审核
It survided my first day at work with it.,I upgraded to this from a LG expression. A huge jump as it were. I am very satisfied. The phone works great and as described.

Fantastic phone without being tablet sized,"So I did a lot of debating before I got this phone. I was constantly going to different stores to try out the display models, compare cameras, operating systems, and ruggedness. I have had this phone now for a few months and I still really like it. However it did let me down in a few areas.Camera:Okay so I bought this because I looked at a ton of reviews on the samsung cameras in general being awesome. And they are. Don't get me wrong, this camera is better than the iPhone 6 any day, but for an artistic person like me, it has to be perfect. With 16 mp's, the resolution was never a problem, but it was more the fact that I have to hold my breath to get a fantastic picture. Unlike the Galaxy S6 or S7, this phone had an issue with auto focus that was because of the software used for the actual camera. So if you are taking still pictures or macro of a tulip, you have to be 2-3 inches farther away than any other phone, or it just keeps over focusing. I was pretty bummed out. I had an iPhone 5S before and I did side by side photo and video, and the iPhone was crushed in all aspects except for close up photos. So if this is critical to you, get an S6 or S7.Memory:Another key feature with this was the removable back. You can put in an SD card and put any number of photos, videos and apps on there. This was what set the S5 and the S6 apart for me.Ruggedness:This was a pretty exciting thing for me. When I got my phone I was pretty nervous until one day I just put it in the shower with the water on while it warmed up. Nothing seemed wrong with it, which is pretty cool. I love the hard casing that is part of this, I didn't feel a need to do what I always do, which is to buy an otterbox. I've dropped this so many times and not had anything happen.Screen/display:This is about as HD and clear as it gets. Beautiful graphics. The screen is smooth to the touch and I find that it doesn't seem to get fingerprint smudges on it nearly as easily as some other phones. No cracks or scratches on the screen.Performance:I can usually play pokemon on here for an hour or so and it won't glitch, freeze or get hot. I like Android much more that Apple because it doesn't lock you down or limit your options. I mean, you can't play pokemon on an iPhone without a jailbreak. So I felt a lot of freedom in the software. You can also delete or disable apps, which is awesome. Bloatware can't always be completely removed, but disabling in the app settings will keep it from taking away from processing power. One thing I've found is that this phone likes to be restarted sometimes, just like any computer. If you don't turn it off ~once a week, it will glitch and freeze on occasion, but restarting really doesn't take that long.Overall:I think if you don't have a super high standard for something, this phone is perfect. It isn't the newest flagship of phones, so it is cheaper, but you get a lot of bang for your buck. Maybe a lite photographer like me is a bit stuck on the camera, but I'm sure others won't notice the little things, so if you're searching for a solid phone, this will more than do the job!",2016年4月11日 在美国审核

I wish I would have purchased the HTC One M8,"I've had this phone since July of 2014, and I have an overwhelming feeling of buyer's remorse. I did research for about two weeks on the phone, and the majority of user reviews noted the formidable processor and the amount of RAM that the phone has. While the processor definitely isn't an issue, the TouchWiz Interface and LACK of RAM is. Samsung's skin is way too heavy for a mobile device, and incredibly inefficient. It causes just enough lag on a regular basis to really tick me off. Sometimes my S5 refuses to run applications due to a lack of available RAM. As a matter of fact, the phone out of the box sits at about 80-90% RAM usage. This phone would probably do just fine with 3 GB of RAM.The biggest peeve of mine is the update system. No matter what I try, I CANNOT update my phone past 4.4.2, and the S5 Active has already had the lollipop release. I imagine that I could take a trip to bestbuy, but I live in the country and would have to travel over 30 minutes to get to one. PAIN IN THE A**.The moral of the story is: Don't be enamored with a pretty phone with pretty icons, a pretty screen, and fancy bells and whistles. If you're looking for a great 2014 flagship device, get the HTC One M8.Update 8/24/2015: I finally got to a Bestbuy, and had the phone's updating system fixed after going to the store, being sent home, completely wiping and restoring, then returning to the store. The Bestbuy associate was friendly and helpful, but for some reason the phone wouldn't cooperate with her software (no surprise). Android 5 was great for about two days, then the nightmares returned. It's back to its slow, lethargic self. I dread having to switch apps, and often the keyboard will crash while typing text messages.Please don't buy this phone. Right now I'm desperately looking for a way out because this was a $200 investment in productivity that I would just prefer not to use. I feel like I've been good to this phone: I've always been diligent about closing apps, clearing ram, removing junk from phone, but it has not returned the favor.

I'm really tough on phones especially the more fragile smart phones. I'm also a bit of a nerd,"I've used rugged and active phones for years due to the fact that I help out at the family horse farm a lot. Between horses and weather, not to mention my own carelessness, I'm really tough on phones especially the more fragile smart phones. I'm also a bit of a nerd, so I've always tried to go for the best I can get of durability and available technology. Samsung has been the best answer for me for years. It took almost two years, maybe a year and a half (I forget) for me to wear out a Galaxy Rugby Pro, and after almost a year of use I drowned an S4 Active - while helping neighbors in the midst of a tornado downpour. And even then, the phone still technically works, just not the back button. So I was expecting the same kind of quality from the S5. Boy was I wrong.I got my first (yep first) one in December. Was very pleased with it until it started holding less and less of a charge. Slowly of the course of a month I found myself having to charge it two or three times during the day when suddenly, poof, it stopped charging all together! Nothing! Bought a new battery, still wouldn't take a charge. So had to get a new phone, which was another S5 Active. This happened in April. So only 4 months of use.Now my biggest complaint about the old S5 Active was that it could never send or receive multimedia messages. I use Straight Talk and I worked for hours and hours. I could get the internet to work, but never the multimedia messaging. I eventually gave up. I had the same problem with the new phone, plus it would never save anything in the dictionary I told it to for longer than a half hour. The lock screen timer also didn't work. But I had to have a phone and I was out of money so I just dealt with it.Yesterday was Memorial Day. One of the volunteers we get at the farm is Active military and has been asking if we could take the horses swimming in our big pond - one of our favorite summer activities. So we did. I crossed the pond on my stallion and realized I left both my glasses on and my phone in my pocket (see, carelessness). I was only slightly concerned for the phone - the S4 I'd done the same with and it was fine, plus this had a case on it to help. Nevertheless, when it came out of the water, it was dead as a doornail. It's been drying all night, even in rice and out in the open.....Still nothing. All the internal water indicators are red. This baby is toast. And it lasted right at a month.So between two phones of the same model, this phone lasted me 5 months.If your looking for a high tech alternative to a rugged phone, look elsewhere. Unless you have insurance. Because this phone is just flushing money down the drain.",2016年5月31日 在美国审核

The display and color are beautiful, the back camera and even the front camera are great, I love how much storage is already on it and that you can add as much as you want. With as much as I use my phone, the battery lasts from the time I wake up until I go to bed, and this phone is pretty darn durable too. I have a glass screen protector and a clear silicone case, and my phone hasn't gotten any scratches or dings on it in four months!

Also for the supposed durability I have yet to drop this phone on a concrete floor, or any other surface that hard. As I said YET!I sure hope if I do it will stand up to samsungs claims!! Before I chose this phone I did hours of research there are many other great phones out there but nothing that combines the durability factor with all the bells and whistles as this one does so nicely.The battery life is also great! I'm on my phone non stop and a get a full day from the battery.It sure beats having to charge my phone multiple times a day or carrying a charger with me everywhere I go!

which has worked fine and not had any problems with updates or anything,"I'm sure the product deserves one more star but let me explain.I bought this because I had been using a company phone, after my phone broke at work, for two years when by boss called to tell me I needed to leave it in the office for a new guy to use for the weekend. Having been the only phone I had, I needed to find a replacement for it asap. I had been wanting to get a Galaxy Note since I was used to the Galaxy Mega. Well guys, we all know the problems the latest Note 7 had. So that wasn't an option. I was hoping they would come back out with it this year; who knows at this point, I think they are just making a 7 plus instead; anyway, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a phone I really wanted to replace when and if they came out with what I was looking for. So I bought this, a two generation old phone, which has worked fine and not had any problems with updates or anything. Well, aside from updates causing it to get extremely hot and using at least 25% of battery life during an update. Most of the problems I have with the device itself is probably software related as I have done web searches and research to find a lot of other people have the same problems. Wake up google, let people better customize their devices. Back to the point. I needed a phone, I ordered this one. New. It arrived on time. As soon as I pulled it out of the box I noticed it. It already had a screen protector on it. Not New. Open the battery cover to put in the battery, dust and light dirt at the bottom. Not New. I contacted the seller who was happy to replace it after I sent it back to them because they swear they only sell New items. Kudos to the seller, but the problem remained that I needed the phone that weekend. I suppose had I have ask, they may have let me use it for the weekend then returned it. But then they wouldn't be able to tell it had been used before me. Since this phone is now 3 generations old I don't see as this review matters. And as I stated before, the product deserves a better rating but my experience is mostly what I'm fussing about. I'm sure this will never make it past the amazon comment reviewers anyway. In the end, it's working, hopefully it keeps up until replacement day comes and doesn't send a copy of everything I do to whoever had it before me.",2017年4月6日 在美国审核

This is my first Samsung smart phone. Lots of great feature,"This is my first Samsung smart phone.Lots of great feature.As with any phone there are things I don't like about it.The camera, although it has twice the mega pixels, my last HTC (Vivid) had a better camera. It's not the app, it simply had more feature (and not filters)- ie while taking pics you can adjust the exposure, Contrast, and Saturation.The volume keys only control the ringer, so if you think a notification won't ring through, think again. You have to change the notification volume separately. Plop!If you optimize your phone correctly you can get an amazingly long battery life for every charge. At this very moment, I haven't charged my phone in Two! nights and I'm still at about 50% battery life (with some mobile internet and wifi usage).I'd recommend the phone. More over, I'd recommend playing with it first. Some features you don't notice for a few days though. Nevertheless, if you get it, like I did, I'm sure you'll enjoy an all around good phone.

And of course it does everything an android phone should do and is very fast.The size is also perfect for pocket, basically the biggest it can allow without causing discomfort.At first I thought the mechanical keys might be uncomfortable, but turns out I like it more than virtual keys.And after having this phone, because of its big screen, I transferred many things I did on ipad like playing games, watching videos, reading books to this phone, and it does a better job. After all, it is quite inconvenient to take a full size ipad into the toilet at work, right.",2014年11月8日 在美国审核

Supreme Deals 18 doesn't stand by their products,"I purchased this device half a year ago. It worked fine for a month then the screen died. No drops or water damage at all. I figured this to be a factory defect so i contacted Samsung to try and get repairs made so i could get it to work again. They needed the original purchase order with the phone id to make sure i wasn't trying to cheat the warenty. I contacted Supreme Deals and asked them for the necessary paperwork. They had been hit by a hurricane and asked for some patience, i obliged. After hearing nothing from them for a week and a half i contacted them back, they said they would have it all back by the end of the week. A week passes and still no invoice. i have to go back and forth with them 3 more times before i finally got the invoice i needed to repair the phone.So i finally send it in to Samsung and they tell me two things 1. that it is beyond repair (the LCD screen broke and it was worth more than the phone was) and 2. it had been tampered with by a non authorized (or not a Samsung worker)before. Now seeing as i bought this device as New this was unexpected and obviously not what I paid for. I contact Supreme Deals to let them know and ask for a refund or replacement. They said that Samsung was incorrect about their own product and that the only thing was the guy who unlocked the phone. The phone i purchased was not even an unlocked device. They then promptly told me i was past the 30 day return policy and they would not stand buy their product.I tried many times and still they would not refund me for their faulty product. As i am a poor college kid who is now suddenly out $280 dollars and a functioning phone i want to simply warn others away from a seemingly trustworthy company to find that they are not ones to take care of their customers.I would not recommend purchasing anything from Supreme Deals as they are not the kind of company who you want to trust.",2017年1月9日 在美国审核

They said it had to be a defect and i was better off getting a new phone,"I bought this phone last Christmas, never dropped it never damaged it, it is only 5 months old. I had also never taken it underwater although it is stated to be a waterproof phone. Then last weekend i accidentally submerged it in a river for maybe 10 seconds and water filled up in the display area. The phone still turns on but you cant see a thing, i took it to geeksquad and they were just as baffled as i was. They said it had to be a defect and i was better off getting a new phone. So now i have to spend another 400$ dollars on a phone because there is no warranty, I would strongly recommend Buying a manufacture refurbished phone if you do or just go brand new, but definitely not a refurbished from some small business that will do nothing for you if something goes wrong.

Average users might find the regular S5 to be more useful,"I don't go on hiking nor mountain claiming. I am just a average college user who carry the phone to the GYM to listen to music while working out and at work during lunch break. The sides and corners of this phone are rock hard, andI could image knocking down a threatening person with this phone as a self defense kinnda thing without a scratch shown on it:p I bought this phone over the regular S5 mainly because I don't wanted to cover my phone with a protectivecase, but I noticed that the camera on the back is very easy to break if the phone falls to the ground at that direction without a protectice case to handle the falling damage. Another thing that i wanted to point out is that the activity button is kind of too close to the volume buttons, which could be annoying often times when I pressed on the wrong one. Lastly, I can't seem to find the root when my antivirus program needed a permission to close some auto start up progams to speed up the start up time and to improve performance along with optimal battery saving without using the U-power. However, the Ultra Power Saving Mode does come in pretty handly when my battery gets low. I still have enough battery to last for a day when it gets down to 12 % battery while using this U-power saving method. PS: Why No USB3 like the regular S5 does? WHY!? Q_Q",2014年8月4日 在美国审核

Great customer service on Amazon,"Great customer service on Amazon.com's end, I have no complaints about amazon, and I don't know if I have any complaints about the phone. That's right I don't know, because I can not use the phone. I purchased this phone knowing it's locked with at&amp;t, so I called an at&amp;t rep before I make the purchase and explained him, I will be using the phone overseas and willing to pay the full price, so he said I can unlock the phone. So I purchased the pone called at&amp;t to unlock the phone and now they are telling me I can not unlock the phone because I'm not an at&amp;t customer. So I basically purchased a $690 phone that I can not use as a phone. Stay away from at&amp;t they have the worst customer service. Representatives are very rude and unhelpful, every rep you talk to gives you different information, I ended up spending most of my morning on the phone. Amazon representatives were very helpful and they offered to accept a return on the device but it's too late for that since the device is already in Turkey and registered.",2014年10月30日 在美国审核
AT&amp;T won't unlock even though paid in full,"I bought this phone for a friend who wanted to use it abroad. Therefore we paid it in full and bought it without a plan. However, when the time came to use with with a non-AT&amp;T sim card, it turned out the phone was locked to AT&amp;T.I called AT&amp;T but they refused to unlock it even though they could see I paid the phone in full. They still asked that I have a ""AT&amp;T wireless account in good standing"". Why they ask for a wireless account if I bought the phone without a plan is beyond my imagination.Amazon was also useless in this matter. I would expect Amazon to be helpful in such a situation. I think the ad is misleading - if you can buy the phone without a plan, why would you need a plan to activate it? There should be a warning sign in the ad saying that the phone is exclusively locked to AT&amp;T and would require a service plan to be unlocked.Long story short, we had to pay about $40 for an online service to unlock the phone. After that it worked flawlessly. And in terms of quality, it's a great phone! So my rating is more about the experience we had at Amazon.",2014年9月4日 在美国审核

"Amazing phone, but be aware of the difference between the regular S5 and the S5 Active.","Upgraded from an S3 to an S5 Active. The guy at the ATT store (can you believe this) was not able to tell me the difference between a regular S5 and an S5 Active.I got the Active, at least already knowing it was more water and shock resistant than the regular S5 (from reading reviews beforehand).What I did not know is that there is an extra button called the Active button. I've no interest in all the Active bloatware Samsung offers and was glad to find out the button is totally programmable (it now launches the LED light with a short press and the camera with a long press).The one real problem I've found so far, no, two problems, are 1) the camera lens sticks beyond the edge guard, so if you lay it face down, you risk scratching (this is fixed by ordering a case) and 2) there seems to be no wireless Qi chargers for it.I even spoke with Samsung, who said they are hoping to release one by the 2014 holidays. There is a strong argument for using a wireless charger with this phone, because one of the ways it is so waterproof is its microUSB slot cover, which is kind of annoying to have to unhinge it every time you want to charge. Not to mention wear and tear.Also because of it being waterproof (which I haven't tested, and don't plan to) they used physical Home, Back and Menu buttons instead of on-screen buttons (those would be kind of hard to push under water I suppose). I'm digging the physical buttons.Every thing else, like wifi and bluetooth connectivity are superb. The display is gorgeous. The photos and movies, the best I've gotten from a smart phone yet.If ATT had carried the Sony Xperia Z2, I might have gone with that (just from what I've read in the reviews), but they didn't, so I got the S5 Active, and I'm cool with that!",2014年7月2日 在美国审核

"Awesome Phone and Design, but Terrible Longevity","Overall, a very nice phone, with a design that I love, but I still had some issues with it..ISSUE #1: The batteryI learned from my last phone (iPhone 3GS which I had for 3 and a half years) that you shouldn't overcharge it, especially overnight, since it will ruin the battery. It took 3 years of overcharging often until the battery became really bad. I think I overcharged this phone (S5 Active) only TWICE ever, and that's bc it was very low and I needed an alarm the morning after, but after only 4 MONTHS, the battery went to craptown, would barely last a single day even with power-saving mode. It would also charge really really fast, so from that I concluded that the battery was the issue, since if it was apps in the background, it would charge SLOWER than normal. I have dropped it a few times (with a case) which could be a cause, but this phone is meant to be durable, and I haven't dropped it nearly as many times as I dropped my iPhone 3GS (which didn't even have a case) and that damn thing almost seems more durable than this phone in terms of longevity.ISSUE #2: PerformancePerformance slowly decided to take a dive, most actions would take a few seconds longer than usual, just changing orientation took waaay too long to the point where it was just infuriatingly slow. Became very bad about the same time the battery did (4ish Months), so I uninstalled a whole ton of apps I didn't use anymore, then uninstalled ones that I thought might be eating up RAM in the background, issues still persisted. Ended up restoring phone to factory settings, after setting back up, it reinstalled all previous apps I've downloaded, and the issue is gone.... not sure exactly was the issue, but restoring seemed to have fixed it... waiting to see what happens after setting up all the apps, but so far, performance is back to standard.Besides the two issues, I love this phone, and I hope to use it for as long as I can, I'm not the type to upgrade every year because a new phone came out (I was very happy with my 3GS for almost 4 years). This phone has served me very well. I'll rattle off the pros since I've said enough about my issues with it. I'll be focusing on the phone and what the phone comes with, I'm ignoring anything carrier-related that people love to complain about, since it has little to do with the phone itself.PROS:Active Button:This button can be set to any app, by default it's set to the activity zone, which is alright, but I didn't use it too much, so I set it to the camera, which is convenient when I get a photo opportunity I can react very quickly :)Physical Buttons:Instead of touch buttons, or buttons on the screen itself, the S5 Active has very nice physical buttons, which make them much harder to press by accident, and also easier to click the one you want to click and not a different one by mistake.Built-in Heartrate Monitor:I don't use this too much, but I tested it out for accuracy purposes, and it seems fairly accurate, but if you have a case on the phone, using this feature becomes rather difficult if he case is even a little thick. I would recommend a larger space around the heart-rate monitor to case manufacturers, as I haven't seen a case designed as so.S Health app:Comes with a very nice, FREE, fitness app. It covers just about all aspects of fitness (track running, calories burned, track caloric intake, count steps, ability to set goals, and so much more) and does it very well. I don't use it all too much anymore, but when I did, it was very nice, and to someone who is very serious about fitness, this app would be a godsend.Display:Has a very nice display, on par with other phones of similar size.Camera:A VERY nice camera, takes amazing photos, and has a lot of settings to customize.",2015年6月8日 在美国审核

Exceedingly poor support for a buggy Active,"Out of the box in January 2015 the then current operating system had several bugs.CRS comments from AT&amp;T and Samsung support were to the effect, ""it can't do that.""Then the phone did exactly what it ""could not do.""OK, so wait for the new OS release in March.The big issue was that no CSR at AT&amp;T or at Samsung who I spoke with were aware of the issues or the need to wait for the new OS.All I was told was to return my new very expensive phone to Samsung to receive a refurbished replacement with the same issues.(yes, that is i the contract.)In fact no CSR's were familiar with this phone.One store rep clued me into the issues when I went in to swap the data to the refurb phone.She learned it on line, NOT from AT&amp;T or Samsung.My experience was that this phone hasEXCEEDINGLY POOR SUPPORT all the way around, except for the one CSR.I'm still waiting to see if the new release has cured the issues.In my experience they sold a buggy phone that should not have been released until the issues were resolved.I'm going back to Apple.Now they have customer service.Follow up note: Lollypop:Fixed the home button malfunction.But did nothing to correct the lack of alerts for new voice mail messages for the on screen icon.The pull down alert is approximately 2 mm square.That is not acceptable.I still feel as if this phone is a poor step child, neglected by Samsung and AT&amp;TThat is a shame. because the idea of a more rugged and durable phone is a good marketing idea.It deserved a much better execution.",2015年5月14日 在美国审核
I am super impressed by this thing and had to share,"I am super impressed by this thing and had to share.I love the Samsung Galaxy S line of phones, I had the Galaxy S3 up until a few months ago when I purchased a S5 Active. The transition from the one to the other was seemless it was mostly the same interface (even though 2 generations newer) and there were lots of neat improvements and additions.But that is not even close to the best part.Today I forgot I leftmy keys and my phone on the back tonneau cover of my Classic Mini Pickup Truck. I drive up the block and go around a corner at around 25-30 MPH and I hear my keys hit the road faintly behind me, I immediately knew I had made a big mistake.I pull over and run back, find my keys on the ground and the phone scattered along. The back had popped off from impact ( I do not have this phone in any kind of case, the phone is the case) and the battery fell out too. My phone was now in 3 pieces scattered on the road.I look the screen over, not a crack or scratch. I look at the case, some pretty good scratches on the hard plastic / rubber parts where it bounced down the road.I put the battery in, the back on, and power it up expecting it to be a brick.It fired right up and works perfectly.I have no yet tested its submersibility which is claimed to be up to 7' of water for a couple of minutes. Think dropped in pool and fished out right away. It has been splashed when out on the boat and at the beach.

Superb,"I bought this thru the Next plan on At&amp;t. It's easily the best electronic device I've ever owned. It does what it says it will and more. You won't be disappointed.With that said, there are a couple drawbacks. Luckily they're both easily solved by a case.#1, the buttons on the sides(power, volume and active) are FAR too easy to press for a phone marketed towards rugged use, and even the face buttons could use 5~ more NM's of resistance.. I've activated the phone in my pocket(walking)and I've locked it in my hand(typing), neither of which were intentional. Combination of placement and being too easy to press.#2, the camera. The photos probably don't show it,but the camera is the most protruding piece of material on the back(by quite a bit, too) and although it's a ""rugged"" phone, I get a bit uneasy constantly laying/placing/dropping my phone directly onto the lens of a 16mp camera(half the reason I bought this phone). At this moment in time there are 5 or 6 cases listed here on Amazon and they all look to correct this issue. Mine arrives tomorrow, I'll update after that.Overall it's a super phone, but the quality of life(buttons) and obvious design team compromise(protruding camera) should be noted.",2014年11月3日 在美国审核
Very poor battery life,"Bought this phone just one week ago and sorry I did. I'm a phone novice so I'll have to give my opinion on a very superficial level. The home screen graphics are beautiful on the plus side. On the down side the battery will start draining immediately after charge without even using, I'm lucky to get 12 hours before near dead again. Phone won't allow me to turn off Google Play services which according to usage manager uses most of the power. Others have mentioned this problem with no fix available or that actually works. The cap that covers the charge port is very flimsy and I have been told breaks off entirely after a short while. That kind of eliminates it's water proof claim all by itself. In my opinion just buy a refurbished iphone and forget these Samsung phones. No battery life alone is enough to make it a useless mobile device.",2017年10月15日 在美国审核

"Fantastic Phone, survived 5 feet of salt water","For several months after purchasing it, my Samsung S5 Active had not been through too much. I began to wonder if I had wasted my money. That all changed a few weeks ago during my vacation to Hawaii.I had gone to a beach in Oahu to meet up with a friend to go surfing. I arrived early, and my friend wasn’t there yet, so I decided to take a dip in the ocean while I waited for him. When I returned to the beach, I went up to the backpack where I kept my things to check my messages and see if my friend had tried to contact me while I was out in the ocean. My phone was not in the pocket I normally kept it, and as I searched through the other pockets, a dark suspicion rose in my mind, filling me with dread like a ship taking on water. The phone was not there, I had never put it in my backpack.My hands flew to the pockets on my swim trunks, but they were also empty. I looked out across the rolling blue waves of that vast blue abyss, and all hope drained out of me as I considered the likelihood that I would ever find my phone out there in the water. I figured my chances weren’t good, and even if I did find the phone, would it still work? I asked my wife to call me, and the number went straight to voicemail, sinking my hopes even lower.At that point, I did the only thing I could think to do, and I grabbed some snorkel gear and charged out amongst the roaring waves. Following a zig-zag search pattern to cover my best guess at where I had been when I lost the phone, I swam dejectedly amongst the waves. I hoped against hope that by some miracle I would spot it somehow through the clouded water and sand kicked up by the swelling tide.As I swam further and further out to sea, I began to give up hope that I would ever find my phone again. Just as I was about to give up, I spotted it. The ruby-red Samsung Galaxy S5 Active lay nestled among the rocks like a magic brick, swaying with each passing wave. I dove down without hesitation, cutting through five feet of water with my right hand outstretched. As my fingers closed around the smooth outer casing I pulled up, emerging from the depths like Poseidon, lifting the phone into the air in triumph.Quickly I swam ashore, and as my feet touched dry land I pressed the side button. To my surprise, not only did the screen light up, but I had received a snapchat from one of my friends on the mainland. This phone is tough and resilient, several weeks since this incident in the ocean and it still works just as well as the day I bought it. If you want a phone which can operate under any conditions, look no further than the Galaxy S5 Active. It is a fantastic phone.",2015年4月26日 在美国审核
"The phone works, barely","This phone mostly works for what I use it for, but it is a PITA to use. My first complaint is that the OS has lost its mind 3 times, such that the ""home"" button doesn't take it to the home screen, but takes it to the search screen. The solution I found online was to remove the battery for 5 minutes and re-install it. Great, what if I need to get directions when I am driving?The voice recognition function barely works at all. Most of the time when I hit the microphone to use the voice function, the phone beeps at me within a second to tell me that it is done listening. this isn't a smart phone, it is a very un-smart phone. It is not even much of an improvement on the bare-bones LG Optima smart phone that I was using on a low-cost prepaid contract. I'm paying twice as much and not really getting the use of a smart phone. Oh, and in spite of a screen protector that the AT&amp;T rep talked me into buying--one that supposedly can withstand a bowling ball being dropped on the phone--my screen cracked after being dropped onto a dirt driveway from the seat of a car. A 1 foot drop onto DIRT broke the screen? This is ridiculous for a ""tough phone"".",2015年4月11日 在美国审核
Best phone purchase ever.,"I'll keep it simple.I bought this dark red S5 Active about 3 weeks ago. I also bought the Case-Mate cover in the same dark red to match, at the AT&amp;T store. There are so many options and customizing that this phone does. Unreal. I don't miss my old iPhone 4 one bit. This was an upgrade from a Rugby II flip phone, which was an upgrade from a jailbroken iPhone 4 (I was being anti-smartphone for a couple years). I added a Samsung 64gb micro SD card (70 mb transfer rate) for about $29 off ebay, works perfect. I even found an oversized Reiko belt loop holster at a kiosk in a mall that fit it perfectly.Battery life could be better, BUT, there are tons of options available to save battery power - black and white mode, disabling background apps, etc. I went 3 days without charging, but could go considerably more if all I did was check mail and facebook, plus use the power saving features. I consider this my ""perma-phone"" as I don't plan to ever upgrade. I feel I made a very wise choice. Absolutely no regrets.",2014年8月18日 在美国审核
this is by far the worst. At 10 months old,"Of the 3 Samsung Galaxy models I've owned, this is by far the worst. At 10 months old, this phone is horribly glitchy, has terrible lag time and is just generally unreliable. I knew things were bad when there wasn't enough memory on the phone to install a software upgrade a few months ago. I removed all of my music, pictures, and any apps I didn't use regularly - still insufficient storage. Had to purchase a 32G memory card to install the upgrade. Worked a bit faster for a few weeks after that, then back to the same old problems. After quitting apps frequently everything will disappear from my home screens and take a few seconds to reload. A few times a week the phone will randomly shut off and restart itself. Overheats likes CRAZY. Battery life is maybe half of what it was when I purchased the phone, can barely make it through an 8-hour day at work on a full charge. Drops calls at least 25% of the time. I still have another year left before I can upgrade this phone but I doubt it will make it, I'm sure I'll be stuck having to pay who knows how many hundreds of dollars for a new one, and I will 100% be moving on to a different brand instead of trying my luck on another Samsung.",2015年9月22日 在美国审核
"Good Phone, great deal for the money","I have used a few phones among which I will name the Samsung Galaxy S4. One thing they all had in common is a tormented lifetime between the accidental drops and the “oops” spills. Yes, you can say it: I am quite clumsy. I sometimes ask myself how they lasted so long, poor things. After the tragic “death” of my Galaxy S4, which I did love however, I decided it was time for me to seek for something more fitted for my lifestyle (if you can call it that way). I looked for something that would last longer, have a better battery, have a decent operating system, not cost a fortune, and still have a bearable design. Well, I found it: call it the Samsung Galaxy S5 active! I would say wish it luck, but I have proof that it does not need it as long as I do not try too hard to break it.Like the average person, I did look up the specifications. This is what first drew me to the S5: it is sold as dustproof and water-resistant for 30 minutes in a depth of up to 5 feet. There is even more. It has an admirable rear camera of 16 megapixels, and a front one of 2 megapixels, which is quite decent. This phone also has a longer lasting battery compared to the S4. It also has a decent design with a good internal memory of 16 gigabytes just like the S4. Now let me tell you what I truly like about it. I love that I can pick my phone back up with a smile on my face, every single one of the dozen times that I drop it in the week. I love that I don’t have any anxious thoughts when I happen to spill my drinks on it. I like that it has a very recent operating system, the android 6.0.1 that I obtained after a carrier upgrade from the 5.1.1 version. I am fond of the blend of apps that come with the phone, especially the fitness ones. If you are like me, you want to check out the heart rate sensor on the back, just below the flashlight. The picture quality is really great, so is the display quality. I spend my down times watching movies on Netflix, just great. This phone when full gets me through the day with a reasonable use, and its processing power is worth the money. I have not found, so far, any android game that I was not able to play on it. The lucky phone has not heated up even once since I have it, unlike the S4 used to. Unlike what you might think when you see it online, the Galaxy S5 has a well sized shape and an easy to handle weight that you just don’t expect. What sealed the deal for me was the army camouflage look that made me think it was a tank! Well, I would come to realize that I was wrong after reading a few reviews and having it in my hands. So let me tell you what I don’t like about the Galaxy S5 Active.I strongly disagree with Samsung on the way they conceived the back cover of the Galaxy S5 Active. My point is that the cover should have been a lot harder, and it should not let water in the phone at all. I assume that Samsung wanted to leave room for improvement, maybe planned obsolescence as economists call it. I also did not like the earphones that came with the phone. They are of acceptable quality compared to what is usually offered on the market, but I expected better. The Galaxy S4 had better ones. I love those earphones, they have great sound and bass. I had to order the same online just to feel right.Bottom line, Samsung did an overall great job on the Galaxy S5 Active. Only, one should not be fooled by the name nor by the appearance of the phone. It is not indestructible. It lets water in, but there is just a lot less damage than usual. It is a good phone, even for the average person. For the money spent, I have to say this: it is a great deal for a great phone.",2016年11月28日 在美国审核
This phone sucks is an easy way to put it,"I originally tried Samsung after two years of having an iPhone 5 which worked remarkably until just a few months before I replaced it. I thought I try out the Galaxy 5 because I heard that it had better technology (water-resistance, toughness) but I made a huge mistake. Not even 3 days after getting it, a piece of the plastic on the arrow button peeled off, but I could deal with that. And then I tried the selfie cam which is just a piece of blurry crap, and also the thing takes forever to take pictures, it literally says ""processing"" right after you take a pic and then you have to wait until it's done to take another while the iPhone takes pics within the blink of an eye, allowing you to take multiple pics in just one second. I was disappointed in this but I still tried to be optimistic, though, things only got worse. One of the maintenance updates installed something so that if I hold down the home button, a google search option pops up--the only problem is that every time I would merely press the home button that stupid google search page would come up. It annoyed me so much that I had to delete several other google apps just to get rid of it and even when I got rid of the google search page, I still had to press the home button several times before I could actually go to the home page. I think they eventually fixed it but they've recently brought it back and it's the most irritating thing ever. I hoped that this is where the strife would stop but, again, I was wrong. Recently, it's started to overheat and it's not like I have a ton of apps taking up space or anything and on top of that, it will just freeze to the point that I can't access or control anything or even turn the phone off. I've only had this phone for 3 months but it's as if I've had it for 2-3 years with everything that's wrong with it. The only nice thing about it for me is the battery life which can last for up to 10-11 hours with periodic use, so this is good when I have no access to any kind of outlet but it ends there. There are honestly too many needless apps since most of them are just extra google apps. The system overall is just slow and unnecessarily complex. I'm good with technology but the goal of technology is to make things easier for the user and sometimes I have to go through such a hassle and press multiple buttons to complete an action that could be completed with the press of one button.I wonder if my phone was just especially faulty or if all Galaxies are like that and somehow some people just love them. Beats me. So, with that said, as soon as I get enough money and an update, I'm getting an iPhone 6. I've learned my lesson and I will never stray away from Apple again.",2015年4月3日 在美国审核

NOT WATERPROOF!! buttons in akward locations,"this phone is junk!!!!this phone has been a nightmare since the day i bought it. first, the buttons. there are buttons all over this phone so if you have music playing or are watching a movie and you touch your phone to pick it up or put it in your pocket for any reason the phone will change the volume shut off the screen or pull up some stupid step counter. the step counter button is the bain of my existance. every time i try to hold this phone sideways i accidentally press this stupid button. it is located in the worst possible place. i hate it. the operating system is not very user friendly, you have to check a pull down tab to see if you have any voicemails, rather than it just saying so under the phone app. lastly if you ignore everything else and buy this phone anyways be warned: THIS PHONE IS NOT WATERPROOF!!! i took this phone to the pool to take some pics and vids of me and my friends. i even checked all the seals on the back before going in.it was in less than 2 feet of water for a total of 5 min and the whole phone is F'ed completely ruined along with all my photos from my summer vacation i was on. the only thing i liked about this phone over my old phone (iphone 4s) is that it can take a micro sd card. that is the only reason it is getting 2 stars. please don't waste your money on this phone.",2015年6月2日 在美国审核
AT&amp;T ruins an otherwise good phone,"I would not recommend this phone if using with AT&amp;T. It may be OK if you can buy a clean unlocked version.The S5 Active is very similar to the S5 except for some Samsung Activity and Health software, an extra programmable button and physical keys instead of software ones (which also means no fingerprint reader). It also has a more rugged built-in case which I like as it seems more solid than a regular phone and I don't like adding aftermarket cases anyway. Samsung should have made it possible to charge it wirelessly but otherwise the design is great. By the way I don't think I'd get a newer model Samsung phone after this one as I like the ability to add memory and change the battery.I have used this phone for about a year now having bought it soon after they came out. I really like the core phone but AT&amp;T seems to be determined to limit it's usefulness. First they put out a buggy update. Then they were one of the last vendors to put out Lollipop. Plus the phone is overloaded with un-removable bloatware. I'm running out of system memory so have to put apps that I actually like to use on the SD card.Now I'm waiting for the next update but I found out from AT&amp;T that the S5 Active updates are released weeks later than the S5 updates - so far two weeks later with no news on when it is coming out. That to me is the last straw - no more AT&amp;T, no more Samsung :-(",2015年7月14日 在美国审核
Cell Phone Dropped in Hot Motor Oil,"I highly recommend the Samsung S-5 Galaxy Active ruggedized model cell phones.Picture a 2 gallon vat of very hot black motor oil from changing oil in a diesel tractor.

In love.,"I seriously considered an S5. I was set to do it, but then I saw the S6 active had just been released. And I'm NEVER one to get the newest shiny toy, but when I looked at it in the store (didn't buy on Amazon), this was just seriously cool. It kept saying, ""Take me home...""So, I upgraded from a note 2, and there were some differences for me. Nothing that ended up frustrating me, however. It's pretty user friendly, it feels substantial, and the battery life is ridiculously awesome. I like that it has actual buttons for home and back, unlike the note. I kept hitting those accidentally. The S6 active has that awesome dust proof rating and it's water resistant. Bummed that you can't expand with an SD card like you could with the earlier iterations...you also can't replace the battery yourself. But with the length of time you get on this battery, I am not too sad about that. Charges very quickly too. So far, I'm going almost 2 days one one charge with light use. If I use it more, I'm getting about a day and a half.No case as yet, since it seems pretty solid, though I do wonder if I should get a screen protector to cut the glare. You get a lot of fingerprints on this screen, and that can be a little annoying, but it's not a deal breaker. You just wipe the screen. Easy.If you're looking for a new phone and you're not drinking the Mac Kool Aid (I should talk...I""m typing this on a Macbook Air), this is definitely a solid choice.",2015年6月22日 在美国审核
Water Resistance - Failed.  Samsung offers no recourse,Unfortunately I have to give this phone a negative review.I purchased this phone 6 months ago based on its claim of water resistance and compliance with IP67.However it failed to meet this standard.The standard indicates that the device should be capable of immersion in up to 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes.I needed a phone with this level of water resistance because I am frequently adjacent to water.I was using the phone to take video in a swimming pool - no real immersion in water but certainly splashed on.I had verified the seal on the phone cover before stepping near the water.However the seal did not hold and water got into the phone.AT&amp;T would not provide any warranty for the phone so I sent it directly to Samsung.They also declined to offer support stating that it was beyond repair.I don't question that - it was beyond repair because the seal on the device failed and it did not live up to its claim of water resistance.So if you are looking for a water resistant phone I strongly urge you to look elsewhere - I believe Sony may have one.I think Samsung is being disingenuous in claiming water resistance and then not standing by their claims.Samsung Active - but not if you are active near water!What is IP67:Read here for info:http://www.androidauthority.com/ip-rating-system-explained-221948/,2015年6月22日 在美国审核
"Great phone, I love it!","I got this phone through AT&amp;T instead of Amazon, but this is an amazing phone no matter where you get it from. I came from the Galaxy S3, so this was a great step up. The screen on the phone is very easy to see outdoors and it's easy to adjust it also. The speaker on it is loud and clear too, which is always a plus when listening to music or using speakerphone.Talk about speakerphone, the noise reduction is so great on this phone, that you can talk on it while in the shower and no one will hear the water running at all. I have used this phone in the pool and it takes amazing underwater video and photos. It's not a flimsy phone, it's a little bit chunkier than the normal S5, which isn't a big deal, it feels nice in the hand and it's not slippery.

mine has taken a beating.,"I've had this phone for about six months so figured I'd write a review.First off, and the reason for 4 stars.Really the only thing I don't like about the phone. The sensitivity of the touch screen.I've read this is a common problem and I haven't found a good fix. With the screen locked and the phone in my pocket I had a problem with the phone dialing 911, that's the only number that can be dialed with the screen locked.Took the lock off the screen, now i just have to deal with random butt dials and texts. Just thought of another issue while typing this,the swype auto correct is totally retarted. I don't remember having any problems with my s3, ( in that last sentence i had to go back and fix 4 words, lol, instead of having it wrote Habib). There might be a fix, but I haven't checked, I mostly type everything out.Other than that it does everything well. Wont go into full s5 specs, ill just mention the active specifically.Haven't tested the waterproofness and don't plan on it.It's always reminding you to make sure the battery cover is on tight and off you drop it a few of the clips will come lose so make sure to check it.Seems to me its pretty durable though.I beat the hell out of this phone and is still going.The gyro froze once after i dropped it, so i gave it a good smack on the table and it started working again. Just the other day I was using the gps to test the top speed on my sons chinese four wheeler. At 31 mph i dropped and ran over the phone, went back, dusted it off,and it worked fine.",2015年1月2日 在美国审核
decent switch from iphone,"Review is based upon upgrading from apple 4s to galaxy s5 active for personal use. I also have a work phone that is apple 5s. The only reason I have the personal phone is the grandfathered data plan.I've owned this phone for about 6 months. For me it was a tough transition. I didn't have time to make the mods until recently, so I'm starting to like it more. Finally now rooted.Dislikes -- speaker phone isn't as good as apple.Always have to repeat what I've said.- battery life, but as I've started turning nodding my phone I've found ways to improve it so it's been easy to overlook it.- the lock screen button. Most of the time I grab the phone by the mid section and tent to always press it. Or when it's in my pocket something always hits it and then phone unlocks and does all sorts of goofy things while in my pocket. Since I've locked it by pass code, I've ""leg dialed"" the emergency over 10 times (6 in one day).- the sports button on the left side above the volumes hasn't added any value to me. If I can, I'll reassign it only flashlight.- slow to call upon my camera compared to the apple 5s.- bottom charging plug in cover; with continuous opening and closing I don't see this lasting.- big screen; most I'm sure like this, but I would've been happy with the galaxy s4 and, at the time, $100 back in the pocket. It makes single hand operation difficult. It my theory that these big screens help deter people from texting and driving since it's difficult, though, I've been wrong before.- health app; recent app update sends error messages every 5 seconds so I disabled it. I didn't find it useful anyway.Likes- durability?; after reading other reviews it doesn't seem like it is. I went with this over the regular s5 because of the claimed durability since I'm hard on phones. I've had a few oh ""crap moments"" and came out ok.- removable battery; iphone does not have- modding capability; not very easy on iphone- updates way less than iphone- bluetooth OBD2; I like saving money and do my own vehicle repairs. Compatibility with this device is awesome and allows me to diagnose.- micro SD card; I can take the card out of my game cam and view pictures taken right there in the field.- power plug,it uses the same charging device as a lot of tech gadgets. Apple is proprietary...if it works. I've bought a cheap charger for this to keep around in case I leave mine. It's worked with all of them. Apple does, for a little while then gets ""device is unsupported"" message. This is true for the 30 pin and lighting er whatever it's called now.",2014年10月22日 在美国审核

Not Durable and a RIP OFF. Broke in Less than two months!,"Terrible phone and a rip off! My daughter chose this phone because she's an busy teen, who has on occasion dropped her phone but not excessively. Still, her old phone by Pantech lasted over two years, and is currently in use again since this phone is broken after not even 2 months of use! One of the selling features was the claim of durability of the Samsung Active 6. The first week she had it the screen cracked for no apparent reason, and then last night she dropped it from her back pocket onto a cushioned lamenent floor and now the screen doesn't work period. The drop was only about two feet! We called AT&amp;T but because this is human error the phone isn't covered by warranty, even though it's durability is used as a selling feature. What a rip off! Now we're stuck paying for a phone for the next two years that didn't live up to its description by the manufacturer. A phone that is marketed as durable shouldn't break within two months over a very minor drop, and there's no explanation for the crack in the screen. Makes me wonder if it wasn't damaged during manufacturing and we ended up as the unlucky owners. But how do you prove that? The other explanation is this is just an overpriced and crappy phone.

The phone itself works beautifully and I've added enough things to my Active button to make it useful to me.The toolbox shortcut is a nice feature which I am also using.I was very familiar with the Galaxy line and its software but what attracted me to this phone was it's looks and build and I am still very happy with my decision. The only thing I would change is to kick up its internal memory as 16GB is not really enough when these apps take up so much room. Not all can be moved to the SD card.

First experience with Samsung will be my last,"I bought this phone November 21st for my son who works construction and usually purchases a stronger phone or case. On December 10th the phone fell off a 2 1/2 foot pony wall onto a shower pan liner (30 mil rubberized material) in a bathroom that he was working on and the internal part of the screen broke. The phone will make sounds, but no screen in any way. Samsung and At&amp;t both claim the phone is drop resistant up to 4 feet onto a flat surface. This was less than that onto a flat rubberized surface. Neither company will even look at the phone for less than another $160. This was the first Samsung device we had ever purchased. I had also bought a Samsung BluRay player. I am returning the BluRay player tomorrow to help fund the repair of my sons $650 paperweight. After my experience with both companies, I will never purchase or recommend a Samsung product again and I will be switching from At&amp;t as soon as I can find a company willing to buy out our contracts.",2014年12月16日 在美国审核

Camera is a joke &amp; the phone censors you.,"I upgraded from the s2 to this. My main desire was a better camera. While I do (mostly) like the phone's functions better, the camera is terrible. I don't know how it gets such great reviews for having an awesome camera. All of my pictures are fuzzy on the edges, except for those taken IN FULL sunlight, and only if you aren't zoomed in. It doesn't have a macro setting and you can forget about getting decent photos of up-close subjects because they'll all be fuzzy and basically crappy. It's as bad as the digital cameras were when they first came out!The other really annoying thing is that there are a plethora of words the phone refuses to put into text, unless you type every letter and click the check mark. Every time.It will not put these words into the phone's dictionary for you, either. This includes words like ""sucks"" (and any derivatives of), sexy, butt, and things like that. Really? Trying to say the heat has sucked the life out of you is naughty? Saying your butt hurts from sitting on it is too? I seriously don't need my phone censoring words for me. I'm an adult.Also, I STILL haven't figured out how to use my own sounds for notifications. So my phone sounds like everyone else's around me. We never know who's phone is getting a text message so we all have to check our stupid phones.The main ""plus"" to this phone is that the battery lasts longer than most.",2014年8月29日 在美国审核

Unbeknownst to me having your phone in your pocket can acutally cause water damage!

Is NOT Water Resistant - Buyer Beware,"This phone is sold and promoted by Samsung and its carriers as being water resistant up to 3 meters for 30 minutes. This is completely untrue. I dropped this phone in the kitchen sink and it landed in a shallow pool of water. I immediately retrieved the phone and the screen went dark. Pulling the back case off I found the phone was completely water logged and both LDI were tripped red.I waited a couple of days to let phone dry out but to no avail. When I powered up the phone the screen would not turn on but I would still hear all of the audio notifications for texts and emails. I called into my carrier and asked about my insurance. My carrier told me I was covered under warranty as the phone was only 2 weeks old AND was a water resistant phone. They put me through to their warranty division who told me I was covered under warranty but that I would have to talk to Samsung.After speaking with Samsung, they said they would ship me a box and shipping label to return the phone. A week later and I still never received anything from Samsung. I called my carrier, and we called Samsung together. Samsung stated they had no record of my call and they would have to start the process from scratch. I initially refused and argued with my carrier at length. Samsung disconnected from the call leaving me to resolve the issue with my carrier. Later that day I got a call from Samsung. Believe it or not they were actually following up on my original call from a week earlier and inquiring on whether I would be returning the phone to them. When I brought them up to speed Samsung said they would email me the shipping label and I could use any box to ship the phone back to them.On all 3 calls with Samsung they have stated the phones warranty does not cover water damage and the whole purpose of me sending the phone in to them is to test the gaskets to determine whether the phone failed or not. Well its been 2 weeks and Samsung is now returning my phone to me. AS IS. They haven't tested the gaskets but have deemed the phone is beyond economical repair.THIS IS NOT A WATER RESISTANT PHONE and if you get it wet, Samsung and your carrier won't bother to honor any expectations that it is water resistant. Do yourself favor. Stay away from the S5 Active.",2014年9月15日 在美国审核

Then I called phone store and suggested they refrain from telling people phone is waterproof. They said they had a new poster from Samsung stating phone could be immersed 1 meter for 30 minutes. Mine was there for 30 seconds. Anyway, no one would help. Finally had to file an insurance claim which cost me $200.

I alway get cased for my phone but the seller pretty much ensured me that I did not need one. And because of the crack there goes the water resistant. I am also very disappointed how samsung shows off how it can handle all of this and when I called to ask if this was covered they said no. In fact pretty much if any of that stuff they show that your phone can handle and if it doesnt, they don't cover it. It very much upset me that samsung does not back up there claims.",2014年7月3日 在美国审核
NOT WATER RESISTANT.,"I would highly advise against purchasing this phone. I had the phone less than 3 hours when my son got some water on it. it wasn't submerged at 3 feet for 30 minutes or anything near their claims on the Samsung website, just a splash of water. Less than an hour later it started acting funny, the screen was flickering and everything acted like it was on a 5 second delay. I took it back to AT&amp;T and they took a look under the back cover (which the AT&amp;T employee put on) and there was water damage. AT&amp;T at that point refused to take the phone back, stating that it was a damaged phone. They told me that I should speak with Samsung, as it was their issue. I called Samsung and they said that if there was any water damage that the warranty was void. I tried pointing out to both AT&amp;T and Samsung that the sole reason I purchased this phone was the IP67 rating. Regardless, they refused to honor their water resistant to 3 meters for a half hour claim. I now have a brick sitting on my desk that worked for less than half a day. If you're even thinking of getting this phone for it's water resistance, know that the water resistance failed for me when exposed to a single incident, and that neither Samsung nor AT&amp;T would replace the phone.",2014年7月3日 在美国审核

Good for an entry level Windows phone/Be Conscious of Seller,"Nokia Lumia 635 is an okay to good phone for an entry level Windows/Smartphone. This had Windows 8.1 on it and functions well. Allows for basic needs of calling, texting, email, internet, and apps. Only issue is to beware of the seller in the marketplace even if it is fulfilled by Amazon. The listing here mentions ""Unlocked GSM 4G LTE"" but some sellers just send AT&amp;T GoPhone which are locked to the AT&amp;T network. If the seller sends a genuine UNLOCKED mobile/cellphone then it will work on the 4G LTE networks in the USA. The 4G LTE network in the USA usually is the 1900 band which this phone is capable.Pros on the phoneA. Fast boot upB. Apps are fairly niceC. Feels sturdy in the handsD. Not a gigantic feel like some phonesCons of the PhoneA. Cortana keeps popping up even if you don't want to use it (This depends on your preference)B. Transfer Data from old Nokia phones requires an app, simple bluetooth transfer/sync didn't work with our older Nokia phones.Overall, mostly satisfied for a basic Windows Nokia phone. The main point is beware and conscious of the seller in the marketplace, even if it is ""Fulfilled by Amazon"". The seller that was fulfilled by Amazon was ""Reliable Communication"" and it was an AT&amp;T GoPhone not completely unlocked.EDIT: As I continue to monitor feedback on my reviews and the comments I left on seller, I noticed my seller review was deleted. So this confirms my advice about being cautious on who you choose. ""Reliable Communication"" seller I would steer clear from completely. Very shady seller. Choose a seller who has had good feedback and a long positive history even if ""Fulfilled By Amazon"" is there. Phone still works good as a basic entry level Windows phone. Nothing more.",2015年9月12日 在美国审核
"Windows? Yeah, Not Too Shabby!","I have read many of the reviews from others about this phone not being unlocked. I ordered one anyway and mine was unlocked. I believe this is a seller issue. Now onto the phone, this is a fairly powerful phone for the price and it has expandable memory which is quite nice. Mine came with AT&amp;T branding and of course their bloatware. The bloatware is easily removed and the phone is working just fine. I also read some reviews that stated the phone wasn't new. Again, I think this is a seller issue, my phone came in mint condition in with a charger in a Nokia 635 box with instruction book. The wrapping over the phone even included the unlock code just in case something should happen and the phone should lock.Pros:Cortana is great, helpful, and funny. She is more robust than Siri and features a more natural sounding speaking voice. She still has some hiccups, but she is very useful. If you are bored, ask her to play the movie game. Need some entertainment? Ask her to sing a song.MS Office integration is a huge plus especially when it comes to revising reports on the go.The Store has some nice apps in it. I shied away from Windows phones for quite some time after being told they didn't have many apps, but I am impressed with the selection offered.Fast phone for the price. This phone won't compete with the latest Galaxy S6 or IPhone, but if you don't need run multiple windows or apps at the same time, then this phone is perfect.Connect with your Microsoft account. You can connect with your Microsoft account and access documents that you have stored in the cloud, very useful if you are trying to work on the go.The battery life on this phone is impressive, but it can vary depending on what apps you are running. Nokia is known for their battery life and this one doesn't disappoint. On a normal day, this phone will last all day and late into the night. This is based on moderate web usage, media streaming, and phone calls.Cons:5MP camera isn't bad, but it lacks a flash. No front facing camera for Skype.The Store, some apps are good, but others are downright ugly. There are a few apps that it seems like developers forgot.Screen seems to scratch easily. I had the phone in my pocket and it managed to get a few minor scratches. They don't affect the display, but they look bad in the light.If you are looking to upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out, you need to make sure that the phone is running Denim not Cyan as this one does. Depending on your carrier, you can upgrade to Denim immediately upon receiving your phone. Ask your carrier about this or do a quick search online.The Bottom LineIf you are looking for a phone that is like old faithful, then this is for you. If you need the latest and greatest hardware and IOS, then this isn't for you. This phone doesn't offer the customization of an Android, so if you like the idea of playing around with the design, skip this phone. For the price, this phone performs above what I would expect. It's a shame that these phones haven't quite caught on because they certainly have earned their spot in the market.",2015年9月28日 在美国审核

I'm a heavy phone user (specially call and email) and the battery still lasted about 2 days.Pros:- LTE works flawlessly (I'm using AT&amp;T)- Emails were quite easy to configure (similar to the iOS)- Love how you can associate an image with a contact and it pops it up on the screen along w/ the caller's information (name, phone nr, etc). I know this is a feature on the iOS too, but, I like this one better.- Long lasting battery- Fluidity between switching apps- Good microphone, speaker and camera- Decent size / big screen- Cortana is a great feature. I've been using the iPhone for a long time and I have never used Siri. But Cortana is a different story- Has all the necessary apps (I am unsure why some people complain, because I found all the apps I was previously using on the iOS).Cons:- Gmail is a bit slower than the other emails, but that's fine- Not powerful enough to run Windows 10 (I installed the preview build for a few hours and then reverted back to 8.1)Truthfully this is a very reliable phone. It may not have a frontal camera, or an extremely expensive screen, but it does the job.Microsoft stepped up their game and I personally think that Windows Phone is and will be a serious competitor against Android and iOS.In a few words, I love it and I am going to stick with it.",2015年10月22日 在美国审核

No problem as I had ordered a replacement battery anyway.One thing to note with the Windows 8.1 and 10 phones. Not all function anymore on them as the support has been pulled by MS. If you simply need a phone that makes phone calls, texts and pictures, this is a very good choice. So sad MS pulled the plug on their mobile platform.

Loving this phone!,"Moving from Android to the Windows Phone was really a good choice for me as far as form and function go. It synced beautifully with my Microsoft accounts and social media sites like Facebook. The Nokia Music Mixes are fantastic, and I love some of the other little perks that came with this reasonably priced mobile device as well. I bought these phones factory unlocked and went with StraightTalk, with absolutely no problems getting the Internet and MMS APNs set right. The thing is really fast on the 4G LTE plan at StraightTalk and bounces off the AT&amp;T towers, so I have really good reception everywhere. I also ordered a couple of the different colored shells at a reasonable price off Amazon and the phones are quite attractive with the original white shells, but even snazzier with the blue and green ones we ordered. I saw some negative comments about the screen size and the number of pixels/brightness of the screen, but honestly, I find the images sharp and the size is just right for my use.",2015年10月12日 在美国审核

Bought them for international travel,"I needed two relatively inexpensive unlocked GSM phones for a trip overseas to keep in contact(Verizon customer). I was a bit wary of the BLU products, although they seem popular. I bought the first one used from the Amazon Warehouse in ""very good"" condition. The AT&amp;T box was a bit worse for the wear, but all the parts were present and in like-new condition. I installed the battery and turned it on only to be greeted by the blue screen of sadness/frowny face. Some Googling showed how to do a hard reset, which solved the problem. Borrowing a friends T-mobile sim verified that it was indeed unlocked! So I ordered the second one which arrived in similar condition but without the blue screen. Unfortunately, it was still locked to AT&amp;T and completely useless to me. So I ordered a third phone. This last phone had no problems, and was unlocked. The second phone, which was locked, will be returned soon. So the locked vs unlocked proposition seems to be hit and miss.As for the phones, they are quite nice considering the price. They do feel a bit cheap compared to the latest apple and android offerings, but I think that is to be expected. There is a surprising lack of cases made by recognized/popular manufacturers. I only find unfamiliar names with mixed ratings. I only plan to use these for in-country calling and texting. So apps, pictures, etc. were not a consideration.",2015年7月22日 在美国审核

Don't Risk It,"I have had two of these devices.The first lasted about two weeks before the primary side button, used for turning the phone on and off and for unlocking it, stopped functioning entirely.I was only able to unlock the phone at that point by plugging it in to charge.This was, as you can imagine, fairly impractical.The replacement phone lasted six months before facing the same issue.During the months in which the replacement was working, I also faced the issue of the phone losing its ability to connect to wifi networks.It originally was able to, but at some point began experiencing an issue where it would see the networks, but could connect to none, regardless of security type.This was only solved via a factory reset.Again, not exactly practical.There have been other minor issues - Google Maps is locked out (probably Microsoft's fault), the browser crashes moderately frequently, and I can't uninstall all of the apps which I don't want - but those would only be enough to bump it down to four stars without other problems.At this price point I don't expect much, and an LTE capable unlocked phone at $50 can get away with a lot of annoyances before it's not worth the cost.Still, at any price I do expect a phone that works, and sadly this one simply doesn't.This isn't meant to be a knock against Nokia, as they were very helpful during the replacement process.It's merely an indictment of this specific phone.It's just not very good.",2016年6月25日 在美国审核

"Solid, low-cost phone","I bought this last week for use on the Union Wireless network in Wyoming. This particular model (Lumina 635 RM-975) handled the right 3G and 4G frequencies for my carrier and the other carriers it has nationwide contracts with. I was a bit unsure if it would work, since I had read elsewhere in comments that this phone is unlocked only for AT&amp;T, but it worked fine on my local wireless network.Being unfamiliar with Android, but familiar with Windows, I am able to navigate and run the phone's operating system easier than I can on our other phone, which operates on Android, which I find less intuitive.",2015年9月18日 在美国审核

This is the little phone that could :),Decent smart phone for only $60!!! Windows phone operating system has been very improved compare to what it was before.

Good but not great.,"I don't know whether this phone is truly unlocked because I didn't have another provider's sim to try.I'm on an ATT network anyway so my sim was good to go.I like the Windows platform... better than Android, it seems more stable and more organized.This is an entry level phone but it does all I need a device to do at this point in my life.I gave up a lot of flashy hardware extras, and some software extras by making this move backwards.My only regret is the lack of apps that allow more control over personalizing the phone's use.This model doesn't support an automatic power on/off ... or a gravity or proximity sensor sleep/wake for the screen.It doesn't support the double tap screen ""wake up"" either.I will be using the power button a lot more than I had to with the newer Androids, and I wish Windows or Nokia would update the hardware controls to offer those features.Otherwise, the 635 is sturdy, lightweight, the right size, and I don't miss not having an led flash because the camera takes decent pix without one.I find Cortana a little dense at times, but we're getting along okay.I wish Nokia would put a voice microphone on the keyboard, independent of Cortana, for those of us who like to dictate text rather than type.Bottom line, it's a real nice phone, but not a great one.I don't do email or social media, or play action games on it... it's basically my phone and information highway",2015年6月29日 在美国审核

"Great OS, Mediocre Hardware","I migrated to the 635 from an iPhone 4.I've been using this phone exclusively for about a month now, and I'm very pleased.I'm giving the hardware 3 stars, but Windows Phone 8.1 OS brings up the product to 4 stars.The reason the phone hardware gets 3 stars is because it lacks a LED flash, lacks a face camera, the camera is mediocre, the screen resolution is average, and battery life is adequate for about a day and a half of normal use.The hardware shortcomings are compensated for by the Windows Phone OS which is a clean, friction-less, and intuitive interface.My migration from an iPhone 4 was nearly flawless.I was able to easily sync my google and outlook.com contacts, and Microsoft's online help was concise well organized for guiding me through tasks.When I paired my phone to my car's bluetooth speaker phone, Cortana automatically started reading my incoming text while driving. One minor compliant is there's no built in resource monitoring app that lets me see in one place memory usage, network usage, running apps, and system details.So this leaves you wondering what might be consuming resources.The closest thing is the battery app which allows you to retroactively view battery consumption by app.Perhaps I'll add a suggestion to Microsoft to add a resource usage view when switching apps when pressing and holding the back button (&lt;-).",2015年10月3日 在美国审核

Way nicer than expected! Surprisingly shocked and happy! Fast shipping!,I bought this as a gift for my son.I was shocked every thing this phone does. He had a iphone 4's . And this does every thing it did and more. The screen is bigger than the iphone but smaller than the samsung galaxy s5 .it was the perfect size for my son. It was brand new. And it came with a screen protector.,2015年7月24日 在美国审核
