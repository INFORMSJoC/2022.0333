Not unlocked- review for RSCells,"This phone is used and locked. Phone is not ""Amazon renewed."" This is a private seller selling a locked phone. I couldn't activate it on Verizon. My sim, which I've moved between phones before, was not recognized by this phone.This phone seems to be previously paired (and still locked) onthe Spectrum network. A screen protector was also advertised, but it was not included; unless you consider the huge plastic that covered the screen a screen protector. (pictured)",2019年10月4日 在美国审核
Sketchy phone but it works for the most part,"The phone is fine. It says factory unlocked, but when you switch on the phone, it opens with an AT&amp;T symbol every time and has AT&amp;T specific apps installed on it which can’t be deleted. My Verizon SIM card works in the phone though, so I guess it is technically unlocked. Just feels sketchy.<br><br>The other is that it doesn’t quite integrate too well with some apps. My WhatsApp behaves really weird on this phone - phone calls don’t ring here, the person on the line sometimes hears my voice normally and sometimes it is electronified.<br>So not sure what this phone is, I don’t think it is Samsung that is refurbishing these phones. But they aren’t too bad.</br></br></br>",2019年10月6日 在美国审核

"Quality phone, nice features","I was skeptical about buying ""renewed"" but when the phone arrived, everything seemed the same as if it was straight from the factory. I have been using the Samsung S10, a massive upgrade from my first samsung phone, the S7 Edge. The battery life will last most of every day and I am trying to preserve that battery longevity by only keeping it plugged in between 40 - 80%. And I am trying to not keep it plugged in overnight. The size of the phone is just right. The fingerprint scanner was an issue when I bought a case with screen protector, and it did work well, but not as consistently as I would prefer (usually 3-4 attempts to unlock). Now I just use the face unlock, which is very fast and highly consistent. I have yet to use the camera for a whole lot. But it takes excellent pictures (as did my S7). The night mode is really neat. It doesn't seem to do completly realistic pictures, but makes for some very pretty sunset/ sunrises pictures. I've posted a few photos to see. The case I bought and really enjoy: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07Y771YLL?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_titleHopefully this review helps!",2019年12月20日 在美国审核
Is your review of the SELLER or the PHONE?,"So many people complaining about locked phones, bad IMEI, etc.These reviews are specific to the SELLER who ships the phone to you, not the phone itself.The phone itself is the typical Galaxy S line phone.It's a nice phone, fast, sleek, good battery, etc.If you want a full review of the phone there are plenty of places to read them.My suggestion is to be careful who the SELLER is when you add this phone to your cart.Be sure to read the specific SELLER reviews.My seller (Be My Deal) was awesome, but I checked their reviews before ordering.They shipped faster than expected, the phones were in pristine condition, they worked as expected and were unlocked and not fake or stolen phones.Granted these were CARRIER UNLOCKED phones (vs FACTORY unlocked), which means one of them has a T-Mobile splash screen and bloatware, but that doesn't mean that the phone cannot be activated on a Verizon network since it is technically carrier unlocked, it just means I will forever see the t-mobile logo when booting, which I can get over.I have both phones successfully working on a Verizon MVNO without any issue.In all, I can't complain.The phones are pristine and work as expected which is all I can ask for from a renewed phone.",2021年7月5日 在美国审核

Phone truly looks and functions like new!,"I needed to get another phone for my daughter whose corner screen was cracked as well as the back.I sent it in to Samsung to be fixed under a promotion and they then tried to charge for an lcd screen.The cost rose from 117 to 280.The phone actually works perfectly, save for the small cracked area on the bottom corner, but we wanted to replace the cracked screen under the promotion.Anyhow, I am still working with Samsung about this as they claim they always replace the lcd screens on s10's when replace the front screen.Which is fine, if you honor the promotion price you offered.So, for less than the cost of paying samsung to refurbish our phone, I had them send it back at no charge to us and found this ""renewed"" s10 for less cost.So now we will still have my daughter's phone, which works fine, minus the crack, and this new/renewed model.It will be nice to have a backup for my kids.Now for the review:First, I often read reviews where people complain about the seller, but do not list the seller.So what good does that do?So, up front, the seller I used was Edge Cellular while the order was fulfilled by Amazon.The phone I ordered said it was for T Mobile, but the seller said it was unlocked and would work with any gsm network.I could have paid just a little less for a fully unlocked phone not made specifically for my carrier, but I did not want to chance any issues.I asked about both the T Mobile and the fully unlocked phones and the seller said the fully unlocked would work on T Mobile.So it was just my peace of mind that caused me to stick with the T Mobile version.The seller was extremely fast in his answers by the way.That was nice.I have uploaded several pictures to show the phone and the contents.The phone arrived the next day as promised.So speedy deliveryThe phone arrived in a plain white box with the phone information listed on the side.An Amazon renewed pamphlet was included.The accessories in the box included everything we received when we originally purchased our new Samsung Galaxy S10's, minus the tool used to remove the sim card.That is fine as you can just use a small paper clip.All the accessories are samsung products.I was surprised by this, but pleasantly. I have used them and they all work as expected.I have used the included fast charger and the earbuds.Both worked perfectly.The Phone is immaculate.If I did not know any better, I would say the phone was brand new.I saw no scratches or marks on the front, the back, or the sides.I checked and I do not believe the included screen protector that Samsung provides on their new phones is on this one, unless they have not made it impossible to tell if it is on.But I do not believe that is the case.So, no screen protector.I have been using the phone now for a few hours.I went ahead and put in my sim card and set up the phone with my account to make sure it is all functional.I tested the main things I could think of and I will explain below:* The powered on to the T Mobile screen just like my other phones.* I have charged the phone 2 different times so far, and the phone charged just fine.It charged quickly and charged to 100%.I allowed the phone to discharge, which was slow and the same as my old phone, and recharged.I did not notice any perceivable heat on the phone during charging.As I just received the phone today, I cannot give a definitive statement concerning the battery life yet.But I do not see any difference in the discharge of this phone compared to my old one.If that changes, I will update my review as appropriate.* The screen is perfect.I played video, took pictures, ran some apps, ran through some settings such as face recognition and finger print scanner.Everything I did worked great.So the screen seems to have absolutely no issues.* The settings and different functions I did use all worked without fail.I used the audio for both bluetooth and corded ear buds.No problems.The sound was great.The wifi works great.I hooked up to the T Mobile Network immediately without issue.I was able to immediately make calls.I did use the video calling and it worked, but had pixilation which I had on my new phones anyway.I took both pictures and video and they worked perfectly.The messaging works perfectly.I sent photos to see and no issues.I used the voice recorder and it worked.I signed into my google account and it automatically downloaded my contacts and music.I downloaded an app from the Galaxy Store and it works fine.So, in conclusion or TLDNR version, the phone is exactly as described and may as well be a new phone.I would recommend Edge Cellullar.I did make sure to choose the phone that was fulfilled by Amazon, so keep that in mind.That said, if you use Edge Cellular and choose a phone fulfilled by Amazon, I would feel very confident you will receive an extremely nice product.You may very well get a great phone, even if not fulfilled by Amazon.I am just letting you know how I purchased the phone so you can make an informed decision.",2021年7月22日 在美国审核

Skip the $1200 phones and expensive insurance,"The phone arrived and if you told me it was a brand new one I'd have believed you.I transferred my sim card from my old Verizon phone to this one and within 30 minutes I was up and running.This transaction made me realize two things:1.You don't need the latest, greatest, $1200 phone.Waste of money.2.The insurance Verizon offersthrough Asurion is a waste of money and should be illegal.If the insurance company actually did what they're supposed to I wouldn't have had to buy a new phone.Anyone need an S8 with a very very broken screen?<br>Getting a generation or two older than ""new"" stuff still yields a mind blowingly good phone for 1/3 to 1/2 the price of a new one.</br>",2021年3月24日 在美国审核
Unlocked and Like New,"My S10 shipped quickly. It arrived like new. It only had a tiny scratch on the bottom of the rear panel. I wouldn't have noticed if I wasnt actively searching for scratches.The phone is fully unlocked and functional for me. I use Verizon's pre-paid service and I just moved the SIM card over to the new phone, and it worked fine after the initial setup wizard. I was prompted shortly after setup to verify my emergency address, and wifi calling was re-activated.The phone arrived via FedEx, packaged in a generic box, with a single-port charger, and the proper cable. It doesnt come with the little tool to remove your SIM card, so be ready for that. A paper clip has worked for me on other phones in the past.If you're upgrading from a Galaxy phone, you can use Samsung Smart Switch, and move everything over wirelessly, but I didnt have need for it. I back everything up to Google, and everything that mattered to me transferred over without the need for Smart Switch. If anything is missing for you, you can always follow up with Smart Switch, and transfer over the items you want a la carte.The fingerprint reader works great. I did register each thumb twice, just to be thorough, but I'm very happy with the responsiveness. The reader is an in-display reader, centered and on the bottom (about where the old S7 button reader was). I did try a game. I tried a shooter. I played it full screen, and the in-display camera hole didnt bother me at all. It seems like important information is shifted over from the side of the screen just a hair to be compatible with the S10 selfie camera. Prior to buying the phone, I read that you can also opt to not play a particular game in full screen, and instead shave off that portion of the screen where the camera is. I didnt try this, but it should make the screen feel similar to an S8, which has that side of the screen shaved off for the slim bezel at the top of the phone, where the selfie camera is.As a side note, if you're on the fence between an S10 or S20, the S20 does not have an audio port. This was the decision maker for me.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核
ITS A SCAM! THEY HACKED ME!,"When I first received this phone, I thought everything was okay. The phone was in perfect condition, not a scratch in sight. When I turned it on, it said ""Tmobile"". I was confused because I knew it was supposed to be an unlocked phone. I decided to still bring it in to see if I would be able to use it. It turned out that I was able to still use the phone, even though my carrier is Sprint. Everything seemed okay, at first. The next day was actually my birthday so everyone was saying happy birthday to me. I was getting texts and pictures and notifications, just not to my fitbit. I thought that was weird but I didn't really think much into it. When the day was over, I was frustrated because one of my best friends did not say ""Happy Birthday"" to me. When I texted him the next day, he sent me a screenshot of 5 messages he sent me. 1 was ""Happy Birthday"". I then posted on Facebook asking anyone else if they had sent me a message and I did not reply. 6 of my friends told me that they had said something. I then realized that I was not receiving all of my text messages. The next day, I went back to the sprint store to see if they could help me. I had already tried to restart my phone, delete messages. Nothing worked. They told me at the store that they did not see a problem with the phone. I decided that I was just going to return it and just buy a new one.Today, I was driving and listening to spotify. All of a sudden, my music stops playing and starts playing something I have never listened to in my life. I pause the music. It started playing again. I looked at my recently listened to music. The majority of the music was something I had never listened to before. I looked at my playlists. 60 added playlists of the same music! I knew at that moment, I was hacked. I went into my emails and saw that multiple people have been signing into my account since I activated my phone. This phone helped someone, across the world, get all of my login information. I then had to change every single one of my passwords, especially my bank information. Tomorrow, I will be calling my bank to inform them of what has happened.DO NOT TRUST THIS PHONE. It is cheap for a reason. I have never had anything like this ever happen to me before. I have always bought refurbished phones, and have never had a problem. Especially something like this. If it was not for my friends telling me that they did text me, I would have never known. These people could have broken into a lot more then just my spotify.

Inaccurate description. Not a 4G phone as advertised,"Deal breaker! 3G LTE phone sent to me and not 4G the specs described. I used to buy refrubished phones all the time for the past ten years and never had issues like this and was pleased with them. The Samsung Galaxy S10 phone I ordered from this seller was nice to look at and the physical description was accurate. When I tried to get it activated was when I ran into problems. It is 3G and 3G LTE. I spent about 40 dollars trying to get this phone to work properly on Page Plus before I looked and saw the network connection. Verizon will not even activate this phone on it's network.<br>I got two different refrubished Samsung Galaxy S10 phones from two different sellers and had the same 3G issue. I learned that these phones come from overseas, from places like India that has 2G and 3G networks. The dealers over here are selling phones that are not set up for the networks in the United States (International networks and 3G) and are too lazy to even set them up for the network or type in the correct information about each phone you are getting. You might get the right phone or you might not. Your phone might work or it might not.

Only issues I seen with it by inspecting close with glasses on were maybe the sides minor very minor tiny scratches honestly do not care my case will hide them anywaysThis seller had it shipped on time before said date. I saved like 150 dollars. It's hard spending so much money on something used and old so I was really relieved to receive a very good phone for the price. I usually try to buy new older phones because of the fear and that does cost me. It was truly unlocked no problem there at all. I went with Mint mobile.

At practically half the price of a new store bought, with a few minor insignificant scratches that are either ways going to be covered with a case, this phone met all my expectations and more considering it was an emergency buy. My old phone got crushed by a car so yeah. Not much time to consider where to go next and then be broke for a good while. But I'm glad I trusted the few positive reviews and bought it Amazon renewed. As for the ones who had a bad experience I believe because of not being able to unlock the phone, I think the company knows about the issue and send an instruction step by step sheet about what to do if that happens. Either ways, I figured I could always return it if it went bad. But it was perfect, and I've had it for about a month now and no issues here. Love love love!!!!!

Galaxy S10 is a solid Android phone,"Got this slighlty used phone for my wife as a replacement for a Samsung Galaxy S8.The screen size is not overly large, which works with her sensibilities of not wanting to carry around a mega screen phone.The fingerprint reader, screen brightness and choices to customize the phone to her liking is what my wife likes about the phone. The 128GB internal storage works perfect for app installs &amp; the like.However, the big bonus is the inclusion of amicroSD card slot. This allows a person to add a ton of more storage at a lower price point that buying the phone with more internal storage. Internal storage may be faster, but in the value-vs-reward trade-off, I'd rather have the extra space at lower cost. My wife agrees, as the 256GB microSD card I installed satisfies all of her storage requirements.The Samsung Galaxy S21 is now selling, so this review may not be as relevant anymore.

Exactly What I Ordered,"I like to buy used/refurbished phones and it's always a gamble. I also love when people share honest reviews. I ordered a Samsung s10 and that's exactly what I got. The phone is in perfect working condition and has no cosmetic damage. The charger that was sent with the phone causes the phone to throw an error. It still charges, but it's very slow. However, I'm not docking points for this. I already had the correct charger for this phone, so the new one they sent was just a bonus really. Also, the phone arrived sooner than expected. I'm a big fan of that.**On the phone itself**I needed an upgrade from my Samsung Note s8. I loved that phone, but I dropped it just right and absolutely shattered the screen. This phone is a touch smaller than my last one, but I'm completely fine with that.In comparison, this phone's camera quality is LEAGUES better.The speakers are also a huge improvement. Samsung put speakers on the top and bottom of the phone. Makes a world of difference in sound quality. This is my favorite part of the phone.The battery life is a large improvement, although my last phone had a healthy amount of hours put into it so I suppose the battery was probably not the greatest anymore.My one complaint is the edge screen.

Perfect new phone without breaking the bank!,"I waited 3 months after getting this phone to write this review, because I wanted to make sure it wouldn't have any issues.

At the time I bought this the same phone was selling for between 800 and 700 dollars on the actual Samsung website. I've never purchased a phone through Amazon before and I was so worried that it was some sort of scam or I'd be sent a brick phone. That couldn't be further from the truth. The phone came in a cardboard box, not original Samsung packaging, which was something I expected. It came with a knockoff Samsung charger which was okay but the phone itself was perfect, no scratches or any marks, it powered up without any carrier logos. My boyfriend actually ordered this same one because he loved how good of a deal it was and it was time for an upgrade.

"Phone in ""like new"" condition","First Samsung I've hadin a long...LONG time. Been using LG's and I have to say that nearly every aspect of this phone is superior to LG.Camera takes exceptional photos and I mean leaps and bounds superiority. Videos are magnificent at playback on my UHD 65"" TV.Sound quality is pure - and I use full headphones, not ear buds.Not sure after a month who the seller was but this thing came in like new condition. It came with a genuine Samsung charger and cord -- and it came shrink wrapped. Immaculate!Battery life gets me through a day with maybe 40% to spare at bedtime. Not too bad.I use this AT&amp;T phone on Consumer Cellular and connectivity is good, as is the call clarity.After a month of use, no problems except my usual beef about all the Samsung and AT&amp;T boatyard that can'tbe removed, deactivated sure but it still sits there on your phone, occupying internal memory. When you add Googles junk, that'sall a big irritant. Phone is really nice though.",2021年8月12日 在美国审核
"Still one of the best smartphones, now at an accessible price!","I can never bring myself to pay too much for a cellphone, and I don't think I ever will. I was considering the Moto G7, which was on sale, but I saw this one and went on to compare it and the G7 with my HTC 10, which was showing its age but still kickin' it. The S10 blew them all out of the water, specs wise and at $260 for a refurbished one, I thought, ""what the heck"" and bought it. I'm glad I did, as the phone arrived quickly and showing NO signs of having been used EVER. Kudos to the seller (Bayshine Trading) for offering an amazing product! The phone itself is beautiful, superlight, the Prizm White finish is terrific and the hardware is till a powerhouse, even after three years. I want nothing else in a phone, and I don't think I'll ever discover all the bells and whistles in it. All of my desired apps run fast and smoothly, setup was a breeze, I use it in power saving mode (which is enough for my needs) and it lasts two days, and there is a lot of knowledge about this phoneon the web in case you want to explore further. At this price, it's a steal!!!",2021年6月11日 在美国审核
LEMON ~ DO NOT BUY,"I am not sure if I was just unlucky. But, I AM lucky my boyfriend works for bestbuy. Within 24 hours of actually using my new phone (once I was able to get my provider to transfer all of my data from my old into my new) the phone refused to pick up any signal. Cellular, data, wifi, anything. The battery drained like crazy and it was very overheated when it started going haywire. LUCKILY my bf was there to look it over. With the way the phone was acting, with my sim card still working in my old phone, and the new one recognizing that there was a sim card in it, we deduced that it had a internal antenna problem. Loose wire, fried, old, Lord only knows what the issue truly was. And it probably had more than just the one.I took it to my provider (verizon) to verify that they thought they same thing, and they also recommended I return it. And thus that is what I am doing.HOWEVERIt is in transit as we speak, and while the return was approved by the seller, they have yet to say the refund is also in transit.... I will up date and verify that I got my money back. If not, I am gonna have some issues with this seller.....",2021年5月18日 在美国审核
"Sometimes you hit big with these refurbed items, and this time I did!","I had read through hundreds of reviews, not all from the same vendor, so I knew it would be hit-or-miss.Now getting Xfinity to give me accurate information on whether the phone would work on their system, well, that's an entirely different matter.But, in the end, I got a $750 Samsung S10 for $450, and after a week's worth of use, it's purrin' like a kitten. I upgraded from a S7 Edge I'd had for almost three years, so I was hoping the improvement would be noticeable, and it is. The S7 Edge still works great, but Xfinity Mobile wasn't compatible. I took the plunge, got the phone within two days, asked Xfinity if the IMEI would work, and they said it was ""probably locked."" I immediately reached out to the vendor, and Amazon, and both replied quickly. The vendor said he was sure the phone was unlocked and to keep trying with Xfinity. So, I did, and, yes, it was Xfinity's error. I almost returned a perfectly working, heavily discounted phone because Xfinity told me twice it was locked, but that they weren't certain of that because they were having ""computer issues."" I tried Xfinity's chat service to see if the IMEI was valid on their service, and, same thing -- they weren't sure. By then, I was hell-bent on making this happen. I had fallen in love with the phone, and had plugged my existing Google Fi SIM card into the S10, and it worked immediately.I KNEW it wasn't locked, and it made me feel so much better about my purchase.I had some annoying pop-ups on the phone for software upgrades that I couldn't turn off with the phone, so I got the BK Package app and was able to identify the right file, and blocked the constant alerts for the software upgrade. I also had an annoying Sprint alert that I eventually was able to remove (or at least hide it from showing).Anyway, I am SO glad I tried my hand at getting one of these refurbed models. It wasn't an easy process to get it to work, but it wasn't the fault of the phone, the vendor, or Amazon.THAT part of the experience was really great.",2020年6月11日 在美国审核
"GOOD PHONE, GOOD VALUE",A cost effective upgrade to my aging Galaxy s7 Edge.I was not interested in the latest $ one thousand dollar phone but only wanted an improvement of my s7 Edge that began showing signs of a green pixilation on its screen.The mid price options on new phones were the Galaxy a71 or s10 for around $600.This renewed s10 for two hundred less fit my needs.It arrived looking like new and performs like new.For photos I’ve got two professional Sony a7iii cameras that perform much better than any of the cell phones so the latest and greatest phone cameras were not part of my purchase criteria.,2020年9月10日 在美国审核
Great buy,"I was nervous about buying a renewed phone but this has been worth it. Fast shipping from seller and phone looks and works like brand new.

I couldn't find a single sim removal tool so I had to order a bag of 100 tools!

"Renewed S10, Good value, missing some features but not enough to knock it down a star.","Renewed unlocked USA modelSamsung Galaxy S10.Appeared as if it was brand new and came with only charger AS ADVERTISED.Setup was extremely easy even for my techologically illiterate self.Everything I transferred from my old S6 went smoothly.After using this phone for a little while now, I miss some features of my S6 like how I could set widgets to open a particular app/function with a tap or how I could easily mute notifications with the volume buttons.With the S10 i cannot link my widgets the same and I have to use ""Do Not Disturb"" as well as other settings to achieve the same results.With so many home screens available, I find the edge menu nearly worthless, especially since my case inhibits the edge slightly.This is something Im practicing with.The swipe up for recent apps is nice though.One thing I really HATE is that I can no longer direct call from a text message window by lifting the phone to my ear.I used this ALL the time with my S6.Oh well, Im not docking a star for that though because it is still a solid phone.Good battery life compared to the S6 anyway.Im happy enough with the phone especially since I didnt pay full new-phone price!",2019年10月1日 在美国审核
"100% satisfied with my phone, and would recommend to anyone looking to upgrade and save $","After rocking a Galaxy S7 Edge which had gotten slow enough to the point of irritability, I decided to give this a try. It was either this, or spend twice as much or renew my contract at a t-mobile store.I was a bit hesitant but it worked exactly like it said it would in the description. It comes with a little instruction guide and I followed them and that's it. Switched my SIM card, turned it on, used Samsung Smart Switch and I was up and running in about an hour. I am very happy with this purchase.The S10 is lightning quick and you can't even tell it was ever used or ""refurbished"". Operates and looks exactly like a new one. The battery lasts forever, the screen is flawless, and Smart Switch transfers everything, including all settings, apps, messages, etc - perfectly.Samsung and Google make it very easy to transfer everything to something new.This is a REAL Samsung, and t-mobile worked instantly. I was getting texts and phone within 10 minutes of switching my SIM. If there are negative reviews it's because people didn't read the description and bought one for a different carrier. I bought the t-mobile specific one and I couldn't be happier.THANK YOU - I love my new phone. It's crazy how much these Galaxy phones have progressed in the last four years. This thing is a rocket, and its camera is equal to or better than any iPhone camera.",2021年2月28日 在美国审核
I absolutely love it,"I bought this to upgrade from a Galaxy S9 that my brother gifted me about 3 years ago. I'm a sentimental woman so it pained me to replace a gift like that. This phone had big shoes to fill. It filled them, and then went to the shoe store (metaphorically speaking) and bought a whole new set of shoes. It's the new measure of satisfied with phones. If I hit on everything, this would be a full fledged article but my number one favorite feature is the amazing cameras. I'm a casual shutterbug and this is as good (for my purposes) as carrying around a decent point and shoot without the inconvenience.

Renewed - Like New,"I was skeptical about buying ""renewed"", however this phone might as well have been new. It was in original Samsung box (although not with original accessories), and powered up as though it were a brand new phone. It has worked excellently for 4 days now. One problem I had with sd card reader turned out to be the card, and when replaced problem has not recurred.Facial recognition is not perfect (but good), and finger print reader is not as good as my S9, but in all other regards this S10 is excellent.

No regrets! A bargin vs buying new from a store.,"The phone came is like new condition and has been great for the month since I have received it. It was an upgrade from my Samsung 7 so there was some getting used to the newer version, but nothing I couldn't navigate. The one big difference is that it has a different plug-in charger than my last one, so I gave all my old cords to my kid for hers. I haven't tried to charge without the cord, but that just speaks to my age... I still can't get my head around the cordless charging (LOL).I was able to transfer all my info/apps myself without needing to go to my local phone provider (which was good since it occurred during the social isolation mandate.)The phone syncs with my car without issue, and when connected with a cord (not via blue tooth- at least not that I have figured out) it displays google maps on my car screen for easy navigation (I have a 2019 model). I also use it to listen to my playlists while driving. I am sure that I am not using all of its features to the fullest yet, but so far it does everything I have wanted it to do.The camera is amazing! I use it for social media posts for my job, and the improved detail in my pictures is noticeable. I included a close up photo of a magnolia flower I took while getting the feel for it. I love the fine detail, it doesn't get ""muddy"" even when I increase the size of the image.",2020年5月21日 在美国审核

I must have no fingerprints!,"Cutting to the chase... the fingerprint reader stinks... but after reading &amp; watching so many reviews before my purchase, I expected nothing more.With that out of the way, I love this phone. The cameras are fantastic, the 960fps 720p super slo-mo is wonderful.The screen is beautiful, but I find I'm not a huge fan of the curved edges.Battery life is really good, but I wish mfr's would low the user to limit ""maximum charge level"" to say 80% or so... it would drastically improve the longevity of the battery. One of the most common habits that shorten battery life - is leaving them on charge when they're fully charged for long periods.The other is allowing the battery to become fully discharged (or nearly so). I try to time my charging so that it gets to 90-100% when I'm going to be taking it off the charger and sticking it in my pocket for the day.One more minor disappointment is that the FM radio feature is disabled that the 973U is supposed to have. This may be because it was an AT&amp;T carrier phone, I plan on doing more research on this issue. (I use Consumer Cellular, 1st class MVNO who uses both AT&amp;T and T-mobile towers)Samsung DEX is great... for what little I've used it... but I am really excited to explore it more...

"A Nicely Refurbished S10, As Amazon Promised","When I received the phone, it came in an original S10 box and came with mostly OEM (Samsung) accesories like a pair of AKG earbuds, a Samsung fast charger and a type - C cable, along with a user manual and other documents. The only non-OEM accesories I got were third-party USB to USB C adapter and a screen protector. The phone itself had no visible signs of damage and, as I'm writing this review, I have been using this phone for about 3 days. I have had no issues with this phone so far but I will update this review if I so. As for the performance of the S10, I'm quite sure I could get at least 1 day of use of this phone if I lowered my usage a bit and used the screen at the 1080p or 720p resolution. After the recent Android 10 update, which gave this lineup of phones many more features that can also be found on the new S20 lineup, I'd say you should also consider this phone, as on average, these will be around $200-400 less than its younger counterpart and you will recieve similar features. One last thing to note, however, (and maybe this is just me incorrectly using the phone) is that the fingerprint reader usually takes a good bit to read (about 3 seconds for me, which is a lot more than what I'm used to from my S8) and semi-frequently fails to read my print at all.",2020年4月17日 在美国审核

Looks and functions like new,This was easily one of my best purchases of a refurbished item. This S10 shows no signs of being used before at all. The screen is in perfect condition. The person before me must have taken really good car of it.Helpful info. I got a screen protector installed and it has limited the effectiveness of the fingerprint reader. However the facial recognition is so fast that it usually works before the fingerprint can even scan. Huge plus to have the facial recognition.,2021年6月21日 在美国审核

Great phone great price,"I didn't have stringent criteria for this phone. I wanted an unlocked phone that had working 4G, and any other features would be sweet. I had a Huawei before, which is now banned in the US and had a terrible data connection here. The 10S has great battery life, nice camera features, helpful gestures and navigation options, dolby atmos sound, easy sharing, and other things. I put the Microsoft Launcher on there, it really jazzed things up. I miss having a hardware fingerprint reader, this thing sucks, and the edge lighting is also dumb. It doesn't light when the phone screen is off, I had to install a 3rd party app for that. Those are small things though, I love this phone, especially for this price.",2020年9月11日 在美国审核
Solid battery life; excellent camera; 550ppi; best value for more features!!!,"I bought this for my girlfriend about a week ago, and it came two days early!She received this in it’s original packaging, with headphones (wired) included, USB (factory) adapter, and micro-USB charging cable.Photos taken were from my iPhone 11. I realize that sounds obnoxious, but trust me that the S10 has proper pixel density that’s well above my iPhone 11. At about $450 dollars (renewed), it’s basically half the cost of my iPhone 11 (I bought it brand new).I highly recommend this phone for anyone that enjoys having a headphone jack, doesn’t mind an extra button that’s utterly useless, fair price, decent storage, excellent battery life, excellent camera, AMAZING PPI (pixels per inch @550!!!), and you don’t have to wait long in order to receive it!I’ll probably ditch my iPhone and purchase another one!",2020年12月3日 在美国审核
I am well satisfied with this phone!,I really like this phone so far. I don't know all there is to know yet but as I go along I'm sure I will discover things it does. It has a curved edge and i thought the S 10 + was the one that had the curves. But I'm learning to live with it. The battery seems to last a little longer than my S7.I'm glad I have more storage space. As far as it being refurbished i don't think I went wrong there.

Pleasantly surprised!!,"I was skeptical on buying a refurbished phone because I'm super picky, but I figured I'd give it a shot because of the cost savings and I was in dire need of a new phone...my S7 screen was flickering and would go black when cold. I got it a few days ago and opened it expecting it not to be up to my standards but was surprised when it looked almost brand new. You can definitely see that it's been used, has typical signs of wear on the case and screen. There is one small gouge on the top of the case by the speaker, but with a phone case on you can't really see it. I have Straight Talk, so I bought the bring your own phone kit and was able to get my service transferred to the phone very easily with no issues. Only thing I didn't like was the T-mobile start up screen, but I can live with it because it doesn't have T-mobile service lol.

Renewed but as good as new!!,Really happy with the purchase. Came with all expected accessories and in mint condition. Not even a scratch. This is as good as new which was the best part.

No lag while using any App. The face recognition doesn’t recognize the face once in say 20 times. But that’s fine. Bought it for my daughter who just started high school and she loves it.,2021年10月11日 在美国审核

With the smart sync, it took about 10 minutes to get my new phone acting and looking exactly like my old phone - the product itself came quickly and in excellent condition.=EDIT/UPDATE=Turns out that the S10 models have significant, unresolved service issues. The service on these is absolutely atrocious, and mine was no different. I'd lose service everywhere for no reason at all - calling Samsung was a laugh, as they told me that it ""might"" be resolved in a future update. The seller, though, was nice enough to let me return it, and I've had zero problems with them. Will be doing business with them in the future.",2021年5月8日 在美国审核
Charging port issues,"Brand new phone out of the box with the factory charger and cable, charging port indicates moisture present and won't charge.Apparently this is a fairly common issue, the sensors are flaky as heck - BAD design / engineering.Other than that the phone is fine, but would be better with a re-assignable button instead of a dead key that launches ONE specific app that nobody actually uses. Yes, Bixby is evil garbage that I don't want yet Samsung shoves down our throats in a very Microsoft-like move.

False advertisement.,Do not buy this device. It's a carrier unlocked device not a factory unlock. There is a big difference. The phone I received is actually a sprint carrier device that was unlocked for other carries. With a carrier unlock there is certain features of the device that will only work with the original carrier. You can use this device on another carrier for instanceAT&amp;T like I am. At least until I ship it back for false advertisement and the broken camera lens I received it with. It will work on other carries but features such as your wifi calling and Hotspot will not work unless your carrier is the original carrier the device was made for. For me it would have to sprint. The issue is you have no idea what carrier device you are going to get. Might be an original sprint device or an at&amp;t or any other. If it didn't arrive with a cracked camera lens I'd live without the wifi calling feature and such. Not something that's a necessity. But broke on arrival and the false advertisement... yeah sorry you're refunding me.,2021年3月10日 在美国审核

Not like new,"When I started looking for a new phone, i wanted something that would work like new, be easy to get working, and have at least some warranty. I was excited to try this phone, but it was immediately disappointing. To begin, this phone was absolutely not 'like new'. There were several obvious scratches on both the screen and back case. The phone was packaged in generic packaging with generic cables (which I expected and am fine with.) When I began setting up the phone I was immediately halted... no sim card tray! Contacted the seller with no response. Had to look for a replacement flamingo pink sim card tray, which as you can imagine, was difficult and would not arrive for over a week rendering the phone useless. Landed on ordering a black one in the interim to at least test the phone. After waiting to get the tray, the phone worked very well. Not flawless, but very well. Google account and Samsung app worked mostly (no contact picture transfer). Battery lasts much longer than the galaxy s7 it replaced. Software runs marginally better and faster. Camera hardware and software is a big upgrade. Facial recognition is nice, and the fingerprint works exactly the same. The only issue is that the fingerprint sensor is embedded in the screen and the screen protector (specifically purchased as fingerprint sensor friendly) interferes with its operation.Screen is much nicer and larger than old phone.Overall, this is a very nice phone for a good price. I knocked it down a star for the complete lack of communication, as well as it clearly not being 'like new'. The second negative star is because of the sellers ineptitude. Their lack of attention to detail on the sim card tray left the phone completely inoperable (and still not right because of color.) Probably would not purchase again... def would not recommend.",2019年10月5日 在美国审核

"Excellent phone, had for over a month, no issues whatsoever","I'm not sure what's up with all of the poor reviews and ratings--this phone worked absolutely perfectly straight out of the box. It takes amazing pictures from the back AND the front, holds a lot of stuff, and all my apps work far better on this than they did on my old phone. I switched from a different brand of Android phone, and everything transferred via USBc cable except my text messages, which were easy to port from the old phone using a free app. The only downside was having to install over two dozen updates (not exaggerating), which was tedious, but I got through all of them in a couple of days, it was really easy despite being time-consuming, and it was worth it for the security patches alone.A few things to keep in mind:- This is a VERIZON phone. If you do not have a verizon account, it may not work correctly.- Similarly, this is an Android phone. Trying to switch from an iPhone will definitely not work correctly.- It does not come with a sim card; you have to transfer that from your old phone (although why you'd want to do otherwise is completely beyond me). It accommodates all different types of cards and moving a card from one phone to another is a snap if you have the right tool.- The screen is glass and sticks up a tiny bit. Get a protector and a case if you're clumsy like me. I don't know how it would fare without them, but with those in place, I've probably dropped it a half a dozen times with no issues.And enjoy your new-ish phone!",2022年1月14日 在美国审核

"Good phone, for a while.","I got this phone for my wife, it was the highest performance phone she had ever had. I have the S9, and have no complaints, so I got her the next model since it has been about 2.5 years since getting mine.Well, it ran really well. Did all her games, texting, facebook, video chats, websurfing, pictures, etc....... really well.Until one evening she was watching a streaming movie, and when she quit watching and picked the phone up, the bottom inch or so of the screen went pure white.The screen still responded to touch, but nothing was visible within that white band.The phone started being weird about sending and recieving messages, slow performance, short battery life, heating up, and very slow charging (if it would charge at all).So, I will be returning it.I really wish it had worked out.

The seller was The Camera Guyz<br>The details said ”Product will come with a SIM removal tool, a charger and a charging cable. Headphones and SIM card are not included.” All good I have my own SIM card.The phone I received was Prism BLACK not BLUE. I confirmed that it was 512GB so I decided not to return it. It had the items listed, so I didn’t think more of it and I got all my apps and smart switch completed on the phone.When I was ready to put the sim card in, I REALIZED THAT THE PHONE WAS MISSING THE SIM CARD TRAY!!!!, so I had to order one and wait 2 days before I could finish setting up my phone!There is a big difference between no SIM card and NO SIM CARD TRAY!Despite these issues, so far I am happy with the phone itself, but do check for all parts that are supposed to be included!</br>",2022年1月31日 在美国审核

I've had several Samsung phones over the years and IF this one is supposed to be the top of the ""S"" line, I can see why they started making new lines. Every Samsung phone I have ever had would sink to the bluetooth of the vehicle that I was driving, and even though ""my truck ""transferred in the list of bluetooth sources but it will not sink, so I'm left with using the old accessory cord.

Great Value!,"Review for S10 - Verizon:Product just as described with all hardware working. Setup process was seamless and it was easy to transfer my SIM card for setting up mobile.I have had this phone for nearly 3 months and have had no issues. Hardware works great.The only con: I can tell it was used, but that is because I am very detail-oriented. The giveaway for me was that the speaker at the top front part of the phone has some permanent residue (barely noticeable) which very mildly affects stereo sound output (i.e., when sound comes out both the top speaker and the bottom speaker to give the feeling that sound is coming from more than one source). This only happens when listening to sound without headphones, such as watching YouTube videos with high quality audio or listening to music. During phone calls, the top speaker is the only one that emits sound and works perfectly. The speaker at the bottom of the phone works perfectly as well. Truth be told, most people would likely not notice this con at all (I have some background in audiology and audio engineering).Overall, the phone appears and functions brand new, and I would definitely buy renewed products from this company in the future.",2021年8月19日 在美国审核

Battery Drains fast and charging cable sub-par,"So this phone is great.It's a big upgrade from my last android.I've only had it for 5 days and so far I love it, except that the battery drains very fast.I don't keep a lot of apps on my phone.It is used only for texting, calls, and a little online shopping, browsing, social media.But otherwise, doesn't seem like the device should only last one day before needing to charge again.My last phone could go longer between charges and that was a much older phone!Plus, the charger that was sent with this phone is not a Samsung charger.Instead it says Sharkk on it- never heard of this brand.Each time I plug the phone into the charger, a message pops up on phone that says to check the connection between the phone and charger.This makes me thing that the cable is not the best for charging this type of phone because everything is plugged in and snug as it can be.Furthermore, once plugged in it tells me it will take 6 hours and change before fully charged!!This is crazy.Again my previous older phone took much less time to fully charge.So something doesn't seem to add up to me with the battery life and charging.Will be looking into this more.Additionally, this phone gives you the option to use a fingerprint reader as a security feature to unlock the phone.I thought this was a great idea and have been using it.It's a bit tricky though and you have to get your finger print just right for it to unlock.I've already been locked out several times after 5 failed attempts at the fingerprint.so that has been pretty annoying when just trying to get into the phone.Definitely secure, but when you want to get in fast maybe not the best route.",2021年7月2日 在美国审核
Coulda shoulda woulda,"I've ordered refurbished phones from Amazon before, great prices for the most part.

This is legit and AMAZING,This is legit! The phone came a day early and it was in near PERFECT condition. Best phone I ever had. It is the fastest phone I ever had. It can open YouTube in about 1 literal second and it can launch and full blown pretty demanding mobile game such as Real Racing 3 in about 1 second too! Make sure you buy a screen protector and case for this phone too it has a glass from and back. The 3 cameras on the back is amazing and can shoot in 4k and the front camera can too. The wireless charging is fast and nice and you have the ability to wirelessly charge other devices using your phone using the wireless power share feature. the speakers are amazing because when you play audio directly on the phone you get sound from the bottom and top speaker as well. Not going to bore you with too many details so watch a YouTube video on the phone and make sure you watch a video comparing the s10 camera to the s20 ultra 5G and the s21 ultra 5G and you will see that it is on par with the latest flagship Samsung phones.,2021年7月23日 在美国审核

Highly recommended,"I was weary of buying a refurbished phone online,especially after reading the reviews of people getting stolen phones,but after recieving mine i was pleasantly surprised.The phone is in great shape with only a minor, barely visible scratch on the back,the only other thing included was an Energizer fast charger(not the original but it works just as well), but that's to be expected. I'm not entirely sure if the phone is actually unlocked though, as there is a sprint ""activate device"" notification that pops up when i restart the phone but i have straight talk and it works with locked phones because they use other companies towers(so if you have straight talk you have nothing to fear other than getting badly damaged device, but that's covered under the 90 day warranty.The phone is fast,fingerprint sensor works perfectly and the battery has only been discharged 18 cycles.

Some Things to Note,"If you're thinking about getting an unlocked S10 to upgrade or just in general, I highly recommend you read the whole thing.I bought two of these for my parents for Christmas - they were coming from Galaxy S5's that had lots of hard miles on them and the upgrade to these phones was ""almost"" painless. Android 11 actually played nicely with Android 6 through Smart Switch, which I was pleasantly surprised. There were only two apps that they both used that had to be reloaded - but all of the contacts, messages were copied just fine.There are a couple of things about/on the S10 that bother them and a couple of challenges I had to deal with to get these phones to work.I'll start with the challenges; that's really the most important part of this review. The first challenge was getting a new SIM for each phone (through ATT); the second, on one of the phones, was using Android SDK to force uninstall carrier apps that were incompatible with the ATT network.Challenge #1: trying to get a SIM from ATT was a nightmare because anytime you install a new sim card on an unlocked phone (especially used), you have to enter connection settings that are specific to their [or any carrier's] mobile network. There seems be some variables based upon each phone's internals, so you have to get ahold of tech support through your carrier to walk you through what to enter and where to enter it. With two identical S10's, the model numbers had different suffixes, but both started with SM-G973. It blew my mind that it wasn't enough to just slap the SIM card in the phone - as an iPhone user myself, this was one of those moments where I gained appreciation for the simplicity that their system offers.Challenge #2: Android SDK literally was the saving grace for my dad's S10. Here's the story:I ran updates, used Smart Switch, installed apps, did all of the things that one would do to prep a phone for daily use. However, after getting it activated with a new SIM through ATT and doing a restart, there'd be a message that would pop up in the notification tray about activating the phone. Keep in mind, the phone [at this point] had service and mobile data access with ATT. This message, however, if tapped, would yield one of two errors (407 or 6601). If you went to the home screen and tried to close the app, it'd reinitialize randomly on the hour, every hour. MAJOR dealbreaker for a supposedly unlocked phone. Naturally, I did some internet digging and found that there's a system/OEM app by Sprint called OMADM, which is essentially their activation service. People on the net have tried to disable the app or force close it, clear the cache and whatnot, but none of those solutions actually work long term. As soon as the system gets a callout to reconnect to the network, the app re initializes with the same old song and dance.All things considered, I think the OMADM app by Sprint is pretty smart, actually, considering it saves a person from having to call the carrier to set up all of the network access like I did with ATT. I digress, without a Sprint connection, this app force calls out to a network that it will not reach...every hour. There are multiple suggestions on the net about how to solve this issue, but only one works - and that's using Android SDK to force uninstall apps. I've used it before when I ran Android myself years ago, but it's just a PITA - it's like Linux [great if you enjoy tinkering, terrible if you want to get work done]. Anyhow, I loaded the latest version of Android SDK, enabled Developer Options on his S10 and was off to the races.If you don't know anything about SDK, or if you're having a similar problem, it's real easy to fix. All you need is a PC, a USB cable and the phone.Load SDK, enable dev options (tap build like 10 times), enable USB debugging, set USB to MTP, and then plug it in. On your PC, shift right click in the folder that the SDK is housed and then open a command prompt [or powershell] from that location. If you're using powershell, your initial commands will need ./ in front of them. Here are the command line instructions (which can be found on XDA, if you do a quick search)./adb devices (then allow on phone)./adb devices./adb shellpm list packages | grep 'Sprint'If that doesn't come back with anything, you can try ""Samsung"" or ""OMADM""Then, search for the app. If you can't find it, here it is:pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.sec.omadmsprSince the firmware for a Sprint phone will automatically include this app, you'd have to re-uninstall this app with SDK again if you perform a factory reset. I don't know if it will be reinstalled when the S10's get Android 12 and One UI 4 - but if that's the case, the process will be the same.That's it, do a restart of the phone and it's clear, never to return.Here's the phone review:If you're like ""what's it like to use an S10 in 2022?"" Well, personally, I'm not a fan of any of the Samsung phones or Android in general. Google sucks. Samsung has a good OS, but it's riddled with third party and Google BS. If you want to clean it up, you have to go to great lengths to do that. Similar to how Windows 11 is running these days, if you want to actually control your device and not worry about telemetry being collected or any other nonsense, you've got to know your way around SDK. It's like this: if you pay for a device, you should own it. Well, if that's how you feel, don't buy an Android unless you're willing to tinker and tune.And yes, Apple sucks too, but it's the lesser of the two evils. If you compare the iPhone 8 to the S10, sure the S10 has a better camera, but the camera app is a dumpster fire. At least on iPhone, there's little risk of accidentally touching the screen and a full screen menu popping up. Sure, the S10's got 8 GB of ""RAM"", but you know what? Almost 4 GB of that is used up at idle with no apps running. And you'd better bet your bottom dollar that it kills battery life [and it does]. If you wanted to get the full 8, you'd have to run...you guessed it...SDK. But aside from those complaints, things like NFC payments are weird. On an iPhone, you double click a button and BAM, you're there. It's a 5 second deal on an iPhone 8, and a 3 second deal on any iPhone with face recognition. None of us have figured out [even today] how to use Samsung Pay that quickly. Maybe we're just stupid and can't find the setting - but the fact is, it's not upfront and easy like it is on Apple's iOS.If I had to bet, the S10 will probably be the last Android phone my parents use. When their S10's inevitably give out, I would bet they'll make the switch to an iPhone.""How long might that be,"" you ask? I give them two years. The battery isn't natively replaceable [like all phones these days] and while the build quality is ""meh"", the phones are lightweight &amp; slick. If you have an S10 and it doesn't have a case, you'd better get one. And no, in 2022, the options for a quality case are pretty slim. Almost none of them protect the top of the screen and if they do, they're a bulky nightmare.Just buy an iPhone 8 and be done with it. That's what I would have done if my parents weren't diehard Samsung fans.",2022年1月19日 在美国审核
Terrific Phone for the Price,"The S10 is a great phone for my use with many more features that I will actually use (facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and others).The important features I wanted were the storage size, memory size, battery life, quality camera along with processor speed and current android OS, which were all delivered.",2021年8月20日 在美国审核

"7 days. So far, not so good after a promising start","Update: Phone refuses to hold APN data resulting in being unable to send or receive attachments via text. Had the exact same issue with an S9 about 6 months ago. Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker and I'll have to return. Not desuaded- I'll get another s10 for her.I bought two AT&amp;T Galaxy S10's ""renewed"" for use on Consumer Cellular. This one for my wife who had a Galaxy S7. I haven't used a Samsung in decades but since I was doing the set-up and transfers, I'll make comment only on those items she's commented on.She was upset that certain items DID NOT transfer to her newer Samsung, that may have been on me but, I'lllet them take the heat for now.Bixby is a pain that won't go away because even when deactivated, there is a dedicated button right under the volume control buttons that stirs Bixby's life into action.She was impressed by the battery life compared to her S7 and the fact that the S10 has the 3.5mm headphone jack (so was I) as there is a lot of contradictory info out there on that topic. I bought two adapters that I can now return.Anyway, phone came and truthfully, it was in pristine condition. Even the charging jack was almost unused. This seller even included the REAL Samsung charger and the usual useless 3 foot cable, however, this thing holds a charge AND charges fast...leading me to believe the battery has a full life to it.Nice phone in excellent condition.",2021年7月17日 在美国审核

Great phone purchase!,"This is my first Amazon phone purchase. I was so hesitant, but because of Amazon's awesome return policy, I figured I would do it! And I am so glad I did! I bought an Amazon Renewed S10 and got a great deal for it. The phone itself has great reviews. The phone came with a generic charger and charging wire. I didn't mind. I just bought a new fast charger. No ear phones, but again I didn't mind. The phone itself was beautiful and was unlocked as advertised. No visible scratches or defaults. It looked like a brand new phone. I have AT&amp;T and it was a super easy set up. I just used my SmartSwitch app and transferred everything from my old phone and switched the micro card to activate. I set up the Fingerprint, but was disappointed that it was not working consistently. After getting frustrated, I just switched to face recognition. Then, I realized the phone came with a screen protector already on it. Though, it had a ""cutout"" for your thumbprint, I realized this was the problem. Also, it was not placed on correctly and was off center. I removed it and now my fingerprint works perfectly every time. Still debating on replacing the screen protector because the screen is pretty tough on its own. The battery lasts forever and the speed is crazy fast. Overall, love the phone. The phone itself also shipped within a few days. To think I almost paid $1k for a new phone! Never again!",2020年7月24日 在美国审核

Great condition,"Bought two phones from this seller and both are in great condition. One phone already had a screen cover on it while the other did not. Not one scratch on the screens or back, but could tell they were used due to extremely minor and barely visible imperfections on the corners that was easily covered up with a phone case. Both phones unlocked as advertised.When it comes to the phone itself, it's a pretty major upgrade from the 9+ I had. The only thing I don't like about this phone is the fingerprint reader: it has a hard time detecting my finger on the screen even with major calibrations and is not as efficient as the previous phone. I ended up turning off the reader since it took too long to unlock my phone more times than not. Wish they would've kept it on the back of the phone in an obvious and dedicated area, but other than that, I love this phone",2022年6月17日 在美国审核

Unable to use screen protector la,"I was really excited to get this phone. I have no major complaints about how the phone itself runs. However, the main reason i returned it was because I was unable to put a privacy or any other screen protector on it. The finger print reader doesn’t work when you have a screen protector on it. So I had to rely on facial recognition. This was annoying because I wear contact during the day and glasses at night, so whenever I wear my glasses I have to take them off for my phone to recognize my face and unlock the screen. The phone also comes with a pre-Installed screen protector, but it’s absolutely horrible. Since I wasn’t able to use a regular screen protector I just used the one that was already on it. Unfortunately it’s prone to scratches. The thin film is basically a sticker and gets easily scratched. So my protector got completely scratched up after not having the privacy screen on it for a couple of hours. So my only complain is based on aesthetics, and not the software or phone itself.",2020年1月7日 在美国审核

Nice condition except for a few DEEP gouges in the middle of the screen,"Buying a refurbished phone is a crap shoot. The S10 I got was in near new condition except for a few pretty deep gouges in the middle of the screen. If you don't mind that kind of damage as much as you like saving $200 dollars then this is a pretty good deal. I checked the ESN with t-moble and as of the day I received the phone, it had not been reported blacklisted. That said, it is common for blacklisting to take a few months. I did try to permanently unlock the phone and could not. I got 'your phone is not eligible to be unlocked. Reason code 9'. T-mobile said to try again in a few days. I will try to remember to update this review with the result of the unlock. Pros; phone seems to work correctly, looks like new 'mostly' and was a good price.Cons; questionable pedigree reference the unlock and scratches right in the middle of the screen. I will be honest the unlock bothers me. I have been burned on a phone before with t-mobile. If the phone is not paid off by the previous owner, t-mobile blacklists it. That process took 4 months last time and the return window with this phone is only 3 months.

...awesome galaxy s10 at a super price paid thru Affirm!,hi...ive ised amazon before and was irprised and unhappy at how my one order became a bincha orders...shipping was added though i had Prime...and items arrived via many means all at different times and one not at all...so it was a very skeptical me that decided to educate and place a single order. i wanted a good deal so defined a search with filters for Prime...refurbed...etc. this was a much easier and safer but should have been more plainly usable...i saved time hassle cash using these tools that i gave away to someone else aided by amazon...all the tools i needed were present it just took me 8weeks of stress loss of the use of my laptop and running about from box to post to usps...i was angry confused held hostage to others even thoigh amazon personell were awesomely cool they could only do so much and depended on what i could tell them more than what they could tell me! i felt that they were off site with limited access from remote terminals with no way to escalate or qet help...once armed with some idea of what they could do and what i should have all using Affirm and their - once you figure it out - virtual card. i advisee people to review the payment dates that are every two weeks...id write more but the provided writer has deleted some...most...and all of my review a whole lotta times and when i shout potty mouth at 0217hrs its time to step away from the virtual keyboard and chill out!ahhhh.. ok... to wrap i got what i paid for in white box minimal gear with samsung charger and a okay set of headphones thatcontrol volume and amswer calls...very comfortableif a little quiet. the cell itself is new looing... the only clue it wasnt new was the missing protective film that samsung has over new screens. a manual would have been nice but my provider has one....and they dont offer this cell. forums claim many unlocked are as good as locked but i have a wierd sim provided to quarantine phones given by tmobile to those incarcerated with covid or to hospital administration very early in the pandemic...scrutinizing paperwork while in isolation declared that this sim provided unlimited call text and data with throttling at 50gb which i have exceeded only once but not with the original cell ... the s10 s reen is bright and awesome encouraging me to surf...mature tasteful artistic sites...a bunch...im 53! its healthy!! stop judging me! sheesh..im outta here i have artistic anime from japan to drool over....,2021年6月3日 在美国审核

"Looks new, but too many issues for a new phone","The good: I was really nervous after reading the reviews for this phone. However, I pleasantly surprised to receive the phone with no visible scratches or marks. It booted up and worked seamlessly with my TMobile sim card. It's fast and sleek.The not so good: After starting the device up, it started to look for recent updates and seemed to update. However, I received an error say ""Error: firmware cannot update."" Ever since, every 30mins-1hr it'll start trying to complete the update, and I'll receive multiple pop ups with errors. After 2 days I decided, it was too much of a nuisance to ignore and called Samsung tech support. I was told that the phone was originally registered with the service provider Sprint, and although Sprint may have unlocked the device there can be some restrictions still on it. Service providers are the ones who push out the updates apparently. I was told to call Amazon and request a phone that was originally with my current service provider.Battery port: Not sure if all Samsung S10 battery ports are like this, but the slightest movement of the phone while it was charging would lead to a cease in charging. I couldn't use the phone while it was charging, I had to sit it on a flat surface and walk away for an hour or so.Also, the pre-applied screen protector makes it hard for the touch screen to recognize my touches, so I have to tap hard.",2020年8月8日 在美国审核

More like a canoe than a flagship,"The renewed phone I received had a deep gouge in the top of the screen.It was about a quarter of an inch long and very visible from every viewing angle and at much more than arms length.It was not a scratch.It was a gouge or chip in the glass screen.Even if it had been on the back of the phone, this is still an issue as the structural integrity of the glass is compromised.Any shock to that area would quite likely shatter the screen.This phone has many issues to overcome, and most of them are related to Samsung, not the phone itself.Samsung has filled the phone with it's own bloatware in an attempt to force users into using their services.For example, the FM radio tuner is disabled in what I can only think is an attempt to push the Samsung Music service.Instead of leaning in to Google's Assistant, the S10 relies heavily on Samsung's own Assistant, Bixby.This reliance is driven home by the dedicated Bixby button on the left side of the phone.The button cannot be reassigned and is in an awkward location so as you're holding the phone the button is easily pressed.Probably intentional, but incredibly annoying.The power button is also in an awkward position on the right side of the phone.Due to how large the phone is, holding it and pressing the power button with a single hand is uncomfortable.The curved glass screen is relatively useless and makes protecting the phone nearly impossible.The majority of phone cases are cut so as to allow the edges of the screen to be visible.That means there really isn't much in the way of protection to the phone, which is a shame, because the phone is difficult to hold on to.Any case that does fully protect the side of the phone make it even more enormous than it already is.The combination of it's generous size combined with the smooth metal and glass body make dropping the phone almost an inevitability.Trying to find an adequate screen protector is difficult due to the fingerprint sensor being underneath the screen.Any protector sturdy enough to possible protect the screen in a fall renders the fingerprint sensor unusable.It's as if Samsung intentionally designed the phone to get damaged so someone would need to either buy a new phone or pay for monthly insurance.Samsung's OneUI doesn't Android a disservice.If you look past the bloatware to the actual user experience, you'll find features that are missing from this device that are present on ""lower quality"" devices.The ability to record phone calls is a feature on many phones that Samsung has chosen to not support in their OS builds.The lack of FM tuner use is also disappointing.The oversized phones is not just a problem confined to Samsung.Just about every phone manufacturer has migrated away from making a device that can be operated with a single hand and fit comfortable in a pocket.I just can't recommend this phone to other users because in my opinion it has too many flaws.",2021年8月26日 在美国审核

Not as bad as I feared,I have been a Nexus/Pixel owner ever since I left the Note 4 behind. This was my first attempt at a Samsung phone since the Note 4. The finger print ready is horrid. Takes me 10 times as logon to unlock with fingerprint as to type the pin. It takes at least 5-6 attempts every time. Every other brands fingerprint reader works great. Not this fingerprint in glass reader. It's crap. Go back to a rear case fingerprint reader. The face unlock is so so. It works better than the fingerprint reader but still takes longer to unlock that an iPhone or a Pixel 4.,2020年1月18日 在美国审核
"A cost saving alternative, if you can be comfortable with a scratched screen.","There's lots to like and dislike about the S10, my biggest gripe is the finger print reader. Samsung did far better with having it on the back with the S9. The S10 on screen finger print reader makes unlocking the phone much slower, and protecting the screen with tempered glass much more difficult, and far more expensive. Which probably also played a role in why we're able to purchase these renewed phones, more people are damaging their screens. The unit I received has numerous scratches on the screen. I've haven't returned it yet, but I don't see myself being comfortable keeping it, in fact I'm probably better off getting another S9. The S10 has faster scrolling, a slightly better camera, but it's not dramatically noticeable. The S9 crushes the S10 in fingerprint reading which gets you into your phone, and apps with ease. The S10 you're gonna be doing a lot more finger print reading failure, and that will slow you down.",2020年6月19日 在美国审核

Not a 4G phone as in the description,"My two star review reflects the seller, not the phone.

The camera was outstanding. Super wide angle lens with close up focusing ability that was almost too good to believe. However I still could not make or receive calls. Further investigation revealed the phone was a 2G - 3G model. It could be an honest mistake, and my return request has been approved by the seller, although I cannot simply drop it off locally. I'll have to package it and ship it back myself, which is rather inconvenient. So yes to the phone, but step it up, seller.",2022年3月16日 在美国审核
Phone is technically unlocked but not really!,"If you are unfortunately (like me) and get a phone that was formally on the Verizon network you will suffer two annoyances.First, the boot up screen will always say ""Verizon"" and there is no way to get rid of itSecond, each time you reboot the phone will tell you the Sim Card is not a Verizon sim card and there is no way to get rid of that either (it is coming from the Setup Wizard but there is no way to get rid of it)You will also get stuck with all the default Verizon apps.

Decent phone with minimal downsides considering it's a refurbish.,"I purchased the ""Amazon Renewed"" Galaxy S10. It's a ""flagship"" phone released two years ago for $750. I paid $260, or about 65% less than. After examining the phone, flaws and all, I consider it to be a good deal.Main notes:* Exterior is nearly flawless, except for a couple minor abrasions, but they aren't deep enough to notice unless the screen is off and light hits it at the right angle. I'll probably forget they're there in a week or so.* It's as responsive as I'd expect a new phone to be.* Testing of sensors (i.e. GPS, proximity, accelerometer, etc.) shows them all to be working properly.* Testing of battery shows it to be at about 79% of it's original 3400mAh capacity. (This about where I expected it to be. My typical screen on time is probably lower than average, and this will be sufficient for me. If it becomes problematic, I'll take the time to replace the battery.)* There is some screen burn in. This is something that happens to all AMOLED screens over time, but poor handling can cause it sooner. In certain conditions (brightness / colors) I can see the previous owners apps on their home screen.* The charger that came with the phone is a cheap third party unit and is not capable of fast charging.Overall: Decently pleased, except for the insufficient charger. It's a cheap enough component that they could have put a proper one in the box. I would be willing to revise the review to four stars if the seller sends me a proper charger.",2021年10月3日 在美国审核

"Update: Dropping Calls, Nice photos and decent battery life, but not loving the curved edges","Update 1 Month Post-Purchase: This phone has been consistently dropping calls where my previous S7 did not. It seems to be related to a couple of particular locations/stretches of road. Thankfully, it seems to get okay reception at my house, but every time I'm on the phone when driving it drops calls in certain areas. I consistently used my S7 without issue in the same locations, which leads me to believe there is something wrong with the design of the S10 that makes it work worse in areas with weaker signals.I get that the curved edges are supposed to increase the viewing space for a screen, but when I'm looking at white screens with text (most articles, etc.) there's a somewhat distracting, bluish haze where the light is bent around the curved edges. Similarly, on some websites the first letter and last letter of each line of texts gets cut off/distorted as it tries to wrap around the edge. Doesn't happen all that often, and I'm getting used to the light refraction, but definitely annoying.I'm also nervous it will be more prone to breaking since all the cases I've tried don't seem to have much of a raised bezel along the sides (since that would somewhat defeat the purpose of those fancy edges.)Photos I've taken so far have been really sharp and attractive without any additional editing, even when zoomed slightly and in low lighting. Haven't experimented with all of the features yet, but I like the ones I've used so far.Battery life has been pretty good--obviously it drains faster when I use it for things like Netflix, but I can go to bed with it at 15% and still have it at 13-14% when I wake up so a big improvement over my last phone (which to be fair was quite old.)Refurbished, but looked like new so no complaints there. The charging cable it came with was very short and defective, though.

This is easily one of the best value purchase I have ever done, since this phone easily outclasses any budget phone between 200 - 300 dollars released in 2021. The only small downside is the battery life which isn't bad but also not great. Which is to be expected form a used battery with a max capacity of just 3400 mA of course. From my experience, Average screen on time I got from a full charge is about 4 hours and 30 minutes.

This happened multiple times, and my carrier tried to fix it (software via the phone, and physically changing the SIM card for a new one), but the fixes would only last so long.Now as I sit here typing this review, the phone will not let me make or receive phone calls!Is it a software issue on the service provider's end?If that's true, then my husband's Motorola G Power phone that has the EXACT SAME service plan, same account, would be having issues too -- but his is not.AT&amp;T has suspected it's destroying SIM cards, and replacing for a new SIM card will resolve issues for a few days only.So can't say it's just one bad SIM card.But again, all other apps work just find, it's only calls &amp; text messaging that's having issues.Digging into this further it seems that there's a physical or software issue with the phone's interface with the AT&amp;T SIM cards, which known about when Amazon sent it to the Mfg. for RMA, but then refused to pay the price to have it refurbished and instead just as-is open-boxed it as ""renewed"".Very scammy business practices, but not unheard of since NewEgg was just caught doing this same this year (but unfortunately for them it was caught by a well-known tech reviewer with a large following, Gamers Nexus).It comes down to this: a phone that cannot do it's most BASIC and most IMPORTANT functions is a phone that should have been scrapped not a phone that should have been ""renewed"" and sold again for a profit margin!So buyer beware if buying any phone that's actually new or renewed from the manufacturer.",2022年3月19日 在美国审核
Not unlocked,"The phone is very nice, I'm happy with it. Runs fast like a new phone. There are no scratches anywhere and I checked thoroughly. However, the major issue, why I only gave it 2 stars is that the phone I received is not unlocked. It is still registered to the Sprint network. I was told by my carrier Boost mobile and Samsung themselves to contact Tmobile to get the phone truly unlocked so I could use it but when I went to Tmobile they told me they couldn't do anything. That I would need to wait a year before I could use my Boost SIM card with the device as apparently there is a waiting period before a newly unlocked phone can be used on a new service. I contacted the seller to hopefully get a replacement with a phone that is actually unlocked and I'm waiting to hear back from them. It's annoying though. There are few fedex offices around here to ship it back and I've already put everything on this phone and gotten attached to it.",2021年1月26日 在美国审核

Not a great experience.,Was really hoping that getting a refurbished phone was going to be a better experience. Bought phone in September 2021 and after 6-7 months battery life has tanked. I noticed about 4 months agothat every time I charged my phone it felt like the power cord was failing and wasn't charging my phone properly. After buying new cords I realized it was the actual phone itself and not USB cords. Physically the phone appeared great but internally my phone is crap.:/,2022年4月20日 在美国审核
Great condition. Not unlocked.,"So everything seems great with the phone. Only one scratch on the back. I'm using it to make the review and it seems great. There was a second it glitched out but as someone who has owned a Samsung before, that's probably just the phone. The only thing is that after checking it doesn't seem unlocked. Seems like it's locked to AT&amp;T. Not an issue I'll just get a line with them but still it's the premise. When told unlocked that's what I expected. That can be a big deal for someone else so if it is I wouldn't take the risk but if you're like me then go ahead.",2021年7月1日 在美国审核
Good phone in Great Condition,The phone arrived in 2 days. It works perfectly fine and had absolutely no scratches.

low quality replacement glass,"I have had the phone for less than 30 days and the screen is broken. I believe it is because the phone has low quality replacement glass. I regret not buying a new phone with the factory installed glass. I took good care of the phone (no drops, spills, or accidental ""sit-ons"") for the three weeks I had it. Upon purchasing the phone I immediately encased the phone in an Otter Box, and put the Amazon recommended screen protector on and continued to take good care of it. This morning, while walking my dog, the phone broke in my front pocket (there were no hard objects or any other objects in the pocket besides the phone). The phone broke when I retracted the leash and my hand pressed against the phone in my pocket. The screen is spidering and splintering. The photo does not clearly show it, but the spidering travels from the left side,all the way to the right lower corner. I WOULD NOT recommend this phone, because of how easily the glass breaks. It may be a result of the rounded corners, or just the low quality replacement glass they used to refurbish the phone. Even though I have had it for less than a month, and the phone broke because of poor quality, the company is unable to assist. This was a huge waste of money and I am disappointed. A good phone should be able to withstand the pressure of a slight bump in the pocket.",2022年6月17日 在美国审核

Did not come with promised accessories,"To be clear, the phone, so far, is great. The one star is because Amazon renewed premium promised charger and a charging cord with a renewed premium product. However, it only came with the cord. When I contacted customer service, they were nice and tried to help, but could not send me the charger. The only option was to return the phone, that I had already set up, and they'd send a new phone and promised the charger would be in the box this time. I declined to do that considering my time to reset a phone. They also offered me $5 for a credit. I declined on principle. It was actually insulting to offer the $5 to make it better when an official Samsung charger on their own website is $49.99. The representative, Steve, was nice. He did what he could. The Amazon policy he was working with is bunk. So, buyer beware. The regular renew for this phone was over $100 less. It doesn't come with the charger, but, hey, my premium renewal didn't either and Amazon's ""fix"" isn't worth it. It took over 6 hours to setup the phone. Six hours of my time is worth more than a charger.",2022年3月9日 在美国审核

The display is definitely different and some features are just non existent in the second phone.I'm overall disappointed with this purchase and might actually send it back.

Carrier options,The ad should have clearly mentioned if the phone was CDMA or GDM carriers when purchasing an unlocked. I didnt see any GSM options even if out of stock and now they have added a option to choose it as GSM from carriers. GSM unlocked phones supports any carriers on any country while CDMA is assigned to a specific carrier and its a pain to keep assigning them on a carrier each time a new sim has has been changed. The fact that I bought this phone two weeks ago rather than today is upsetting. The fact that CDMA carriers have their limits to 3G like support is upsettin. And yea 3G has has already been disregarded for CDMA phones from all carriers except for verizon until this december. So should I be happy that I can use it for another 6 months? And then what my phone works only in 4G and when there is a 4G drop there is no to 3G to backup. Returning the item and waiting for another item is not an easy wait. So I'll just choose to pass that. Overall the phone is great and you can expect 85%+ battery life.,2022年6月10日 在美国审核

No Samsung warranty due to unauthorized aftermarket remodifications,"I purchased this device with Asurion protection. In less than 45 days, the USB C port stopped working and repeatedly gave me a water detection error. I couldn't connect to other services (like Android Auto in my car), and could only charge my phone with wireless charging.After visiting iBreakUfix, per Asurion, I was informed that this issue should be covered by Samsung's manufacturer warranty, and could only be fixed by them because of micro-soldering capabilities on this specific model.I reached out to Samsung, who went by the first sale date of the refurbished phone's IMEI number, but after multiple battles, finally adjusted my purchase date.Samsung sent me a shipping label and I sent off my device, only to receive a $550 bill to repair it. When I called Samsung to address this, thinking it was because of the battle with my purchase date, they informed me that the IMEI number of my device was originally linked to a blue Galaxy S10. Because the device I sent them was prism white, the device was proven to be modified without authorization, and the manufacturer's warranty was void.This was my first experience with a refurbished device, and I have not been impressed. However, I took a chance and ordered another one. The second one I received has 3 obvious strokes over the majority of the screen, which does not clean or wipe away.

That and all they could say was their team do proper quality control ( I call major BS) I have included a photo of the box which clearly states that the enclosed S10 is Certified Re-Newed, Not Factory Refurbished which is what I paid for.

I got multiple errors stating that the device couldn't register to the network (Mint Mobile) and wouldn't make calls or texts or connect to the mobile network. I started by contacting Mint mobile and they had me call Samsung support. Samsung support told me to call AT&amp;T and that the device was locked to their network. When I called AT&amp;T they told me I needed to go into their store for support with a.. concerned tone. So I went into the AT&amp;T store with the phone o be told they can't help me because my phone Is blacklisted and told me my phone was stolen.THIS VENDOR SOLD ME A STOLEN BLACKLISTED PHONE THAT DOES NOT WORK!!

Amazing phone! Let's hope it lasts,"Received this 2 days ago and wasn't expecting much when I saw the box. Just a no name box with some off brand charger and a sim card tool. No manuals or anything but enough fuss.I took a good look at the phone all around. There are a couple light scratches on the screen but only noticeable up close and at an angle. The back is almost perfect with just some minor scuffs here and there. Overall really impressed how sharp and smooth this phone looks for being 3 years old.I fire it up and it is completely unlocked and I double check the IMEI to make sure. I put service on it no problems and its blazing fast. I also did the *#0*# call to test all the hardware features on the phone. Highly recommend doing this to verify all sensors and speakers, etc. are working which this phone was. I visited a subreddit for the S10 lineup and looked over the tips on how to optimize and remove all the bloatware. This subreddit is still active and has some good tips on Android 12.0 which just came out and will be the last OS update for the S10 so read up on this before buying.Setup a sapphire screen protector and did my fingerprint sensor and it works super fast and smooth! I am coming from a 5 year old S8 and this phone just makes me drool!!!The only complaint at this time is the battery isn't perfect. I get all day out of it so it's really not a big deal but I am praying it stays that way. I would say that the seller stated its guaranteed to be 80% atleast and I would say that is a fair judgment and overall a raw deal for this great flagship phone which still can hang with these new phones today.I should mention I have everything turned up. This phone has 1440p... The AMOLED screen is just insane and if you play games or watch movies, this is just perfect. So battery is working overtime...I went in thinking I had nothing to lose if this phone was poor in any fashion because I could just ship it back to Amazon and try again or look elsewhere, but for $250, this is an incredible deal. Seriously. If I get even have the life and thrills as my S8, it will be hard to ever investin these ridiculous phones of today. PLEASE SAMSUNG KEEP GIVING FEATURES AND GREAT HARDWARE AND STOP FOLLOWING APPLE.Hint: Samsung is doing this same deal for $350(US) but they replace the battery and make it look new... I had a hard time deciding but am happy with this purchase. Fingers crossed it lasts me another 5 years!",2022年1月20日 在美国审核
"Great phone, like new, nice savings!","This product came as advertised and met or exceeded my expectations so far. I purchased the Blue (not Pink) 2 months ago and I've been using it everyday since it arrived. The phone started immediately and the background splash was the Samsung logo (not Verizon or T-mobile or AT&amp;T, etc.) I was able to transfer most of my data from the old phone easily using Smart Switch. Good battery life but definitely not brand new. Very few hairline (or thinner) scratches visible on my copy but only when looking for it close up. I put a screen saver on the glass and the finger print recognition still worked well. Facial recognition is excellent. Takes great photos too. Hope this helps!",2020年11月30日 在美国审核
Pleasantly satisfied purchases- bought 2,"Bought the 1st Galaxy S10 refurb'd model for my wife January of this year, worked great straight out the box. On Cricket/AT&amp;T. Received 1 Galaxy S 10 phone in new condition appearance, 1 USB C cable and 1 generic charger, not OEM Samsung however each time. Phone start up, function and performance as good as anything I've received directly from any new phone purchased from a national provider/cell phone company. Then I purchased another exact Galaxy S10 phone for myself. Again works &amp; looks great. So far, very pleased with our purchases. Saved $$$ over new, direct from dealer. Other than the generic cell phone charger, which we seldom use (using Ubio Labs wireless charging pads instead) very happy. 8 months later, still going strong. Would purchase again.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核
BEWARE OF SAMSUNG REFURBISHED PHONES,"I just saw that Samsung has partnered with Amazon to sell renewed/refurbished phones.I would be cautious about buying anything from Samsung renewed/refurbished based on my dealings with them.I bought a Samsung galaxy last year directly from Samsung so that I could get the 1 year warranty instead of buying it thru Amazon, 90 day warranty.It cost more, but I thought it was worth it for the 1 year warranty. I had never bought a refurbished phone before so I wanted the reassurance.Th. Small enough to keep in your pocket, great specs, and a phone jack.It was a great phone until almost a year later I got a “moisture detection” warning in the middle of the night while my phone was charging.I spoke with Samsung and sent it in for repairs as it was still under the 1 year warranty.They invalidated my warranty saying that it had water damage, which wasn’t true.After arguing about this I ended up paying $107 as it was cheaper than getting a new phone and I just wanted my phone back after 2 weeks.This is where things got frustrating.After several days of use I got the “moisture detected” warning again.I called Samsung and sent my phone in again to be “repaired”.It was sent back to me again after almost 2 weeks.Several days later I got the “moisture detected” warning again.I called Samsung and they said since that it was the 3rd time that this happened they would send a replacement phone once they received my phone.They just needed me to call back and give them the tracking number and they would send the phone.I called after sending the phone and they said that they were not going to give me a replacement phone and no one should have told me that.There were no phones available and they would have to give me a refund of $406.At this point I just wanted my money so I agreed.Samsung said it would take 3-5 business days to process it and I would get an email for the direct deposit.Guess what.No email.I called Samsung again and they had no idea what I was talking about and no one should have told me that I was going to get a refund.Samsung needed to review the paperwork.They couldn’t tell me what they were reviewing or when this would be finished.I then filed a report with the Better Business Bureau and my state’s Attorney General’s office.I got a call the next day.They said that they wanted to “fix” the issue as they received a complaint from the BBB.Samsung said that they are still reviewing the claim and that I will get a refund for only $406, the price of the phone.I argued that I wanted the whole amount of the phone and the “repairs” as it was never fixed, which would be $513.The representative said that she promised that I would get a refund back, but she couldn’t tell me when.So, I have yet to get my refund of $513.I have been without a phone for over 2 months (9 weeks so far).If I were you I’d consider buying a new phone under contract or somewhere else besides Samsung.I only got 1 year out of this phone, countless hours of phone calls, and nothing but trouble from Samsung refurbished/renewed.I’ve always used Samsung for everything.My whole family uses Apple products; phones/watches/iPads/laptops.I’m the only one that has a Samsung phone and Samsung watch Active 2.I will probably switch to a Google Pixel 6 or dare I say Iphone.FYI, I’m still waiting to get my refund so I can buy a new phone.",2021年12月2日 在美国审核

Careful Who You Buy It From,"I see a lot of negative reviews saying it doesn't work on arrival or they sent the wrong carrier version. When you buy one of these renewed phones it chooses the seller automatically (i think) however you can change who you you buy it from. I got mine from MOBILESUPPLY who has almost 100 positive feedback. It cost around 50 more dollars than what was listed but i guess i payed extra just for the guarantee that it actually works fine on arrival.<br>Phone works perfectly fine. No scratches at all. Got the Verizon version and worked perfectly without having to do any kind of activation. Just transferred the sim card from my old phone to this one.The only bad thing about this order was that they put a sticker directly on to the phone screen and when i took it off, some of the sticker residue stayed on the screen and it took me about 10 minutes to try and take it off but besides that no problems whatsoever. Ill update if something goes wrong later.UPDATE: 4 months later, phone is still good, battery is still good (haven't noticed any battery performance issues yet)</br>",2021年10月30日 在美国审核
Works totally fine (for a couple months)!,"So as the title of the product listing suggests, I opted to purchase a ""renewed"" phone. I did NOT purchase an unlocked phone due to other reviews about the unlocked phones not functioning properly for this or that; I decided to spend a little more for the Verizon-exclusive version because of the poor reviews for unlocked. Figured the extra money is worth it, especially when buying the s10 elsewhere is easily close to $1k and this was discounted to $400; I was correct to do this. The Verizon-exclusive version does work properly with my Verizon SIM card.Admittedly, I've had it for one day as of this review but I've been playing around with it all day. Thus far, it's a completely functional phone. I have had no voice issues either receiving sound or the caller hearing me. All of the functions like the camera (both front and back) and the voice recorder are crisp and clear. No defects or even tiny scratches to the physical phone (screen, back plate, etc.) at all when received.It runs and operates like any Samsung Galaxy phone, and I've had the s8, s8+, and s9. Only decided to go for an s10 for the internal storage space. This phone is NOT 5G, but that doesn't matter to me personally.Only real thing that I was kinda frustrated with was the lack of the SIM card key thing. While I do realize that, per the item description, not everything would be included, I did at least think a SIM card key would be part of the package. Very annoying--but thankfully, I have plenty of safety pins.[ADDENDUM 5/25/21:] So today, I learned that video call is possible ONLY with third-party apps (like Google Duo, Discord, etc.). Although my phone plan and carrier do support video-calls, this phone does not allow it because it is not via Verizon's services; there is no option in the phone settings to turn video-calls on or off as my old phone had (my old phone having been bought from Verizon themselves). A little disappointed now.[ADDENDUM 6/3/21:] Realized that there was an Android update, so I naturally decided to update it. Wifi was no longer functioning for some reason. Not sure what happened when my wifi is strong and works totally fine on literally every other wifi device in my home. My roommate who has the same phone with Verizon has no wifi issues. Mobile data also just simply doesn't work even though it works on my older phones Had to factory reset it and keep it at an earlier version of Android; while wifi works on older versions of Android, my mobile data still doesn't. Very disappointed.",2021年3月30日 在美国审核
Very Happy With Purchase,"Some years ago, I purchased a renewed Samsung Galaxy S5 from Amazon. It was in flawless condition and I was very happy with it. Fast forward to a week ago. I decided to upgrade my S5 to something newer, choosing to roll the dice once more with another renewed phone from Amazon. I selected the Samsung S10 which came all the way from Brooklyn NY to the California Sierra Nevada in just a few days. The phone appeared to be brand new and the battery was able to be charged to 100%. Battery life seems good and lasts the whole day with no problems. Very happy with the purchase.Random thoughts: the phone was advertised as a Verizon carrier phone. The renewed phone's packaging indicated this phone was a ""Sprint carrier"" phone in another life. Didn't seem to affect this phone at all when I set it up on Verizon. Other reviews indicated some battery-life problems with these used phones. I thought, no problem, I'll just replace the battery if I have a problem. Come to find out, unlike my old S5, the S10 requires major surgery to replace its battery. It can be done, but what a hassle! Hopefully it will be a while until I have to deal with that. And last, when I was transferring the Sim Card from the S5 to the S10, I discovered that the Sim Card from the S5 was HUGE compared to what is used in the S10. Not to worry (like I did). You can CAREFULLY cut down your old Sim Card to fit. I used scissors and my wife's fingernail file to make it fit. YOUTUBE has several how-to videos",2021年11月3日 在美国审核
Bought this 7/25/2021,"I just realized almost 10 months later I don't think I did a review on my phone! I believe the seller was ""Kiss Electronics"" or something like that but bought thru the amazing refurbished program/offer for $229 before taxes ect. I guess I was one of the lucky ones because I was completely happy with my purchase and was worth every penny, as this is the most I've ever spent on a phone since I've never bought an unlocked phone staight up like this before. Was a bit hesitant since refurbished items can sometimes be sketchy or not what you expect/think you're buying. However was not the case with my phone! It had no scratches, marks, cracks or anything physically or internally wrong with it! It worked like a dream and as far as I remember was 100% what I had hoped for and expected! Which was awesome since you're paying a pretty penny for a phone it SHOULD come as it's supposed to! I feel bad for the people who got ripped off and got phones that weren't paid off ect and was a waste of time and money. So I feel VERY thankful I got a good one and I guess it ultimately comes down to the seller ect. I'm pretty sure my seller had pretty good reviews ect so I wasn't super worried about it being a useless phone. I know I'm writing this so long after buying it but I felt like I should still write one to show that there is hope and honesty in some of the refurbished phones! Everything worked great the camera is amazing, finger print reader worked perfectly and the battery has had zero issues! I will also add that it lived up to its waterproofing claim...as I've dropped it in the sink a few times and I think maybe even fell out of my pocket into the toilet once but can't rememberThe worst was when it fell out of my pocket as I was reaching to grab a floatie in a pool AND IT FELL INTO THE POOL AND I HAD TO JUMP IN AND DIVE DOWN TWICE TO GET IT! I quickly took off the case and everything and since you can't take the back off I just had to pray it was truly waterproof. It had ZERO issues from that but ultimately me taking my case off was the biggest mistake as it's now cracked on the back and front and I'm going to have to pray I can do a good fix with one of the oem repair kits! Wish me luck...as I'm so mad at myself for ruining my perfect and beautiful phone. I'm a sensitive gal though so of course tears definitely followed While it's still fine as I put some super glue over the cracks to keep them from spreading which has worked great...the worst was I didn't notice my camera glass cracked and now I'm scared the actual camera lens maybe scratched or ruined so fml let's hope I can fix this as I can't afford another $200 right now and I truly LOVE everything about this phone! I'm so happy I got the s10 and didn't settle for less and got the phone I truly wanted! As I said it was worth every penny for about $250ish and that's A LOT of money for me! Learn from my horrible mistakes after getting a great phone and also got this Otterbox which isn't as good as the super hard-core ones and wish I had cos this one was super cute ombre colors and it wasn't worth it to have a cute case and broken freaking phone...you'd think i would know that but we all make stupid mistakes when we know better sometimes.

AMAZING!,"Exactly what I was looking for and ordered. It was the Samsung Galaxy S10 in Flamingo Pink. I opened the box and was perfect. I have looked over entire phone and not seen one scratch, dent or anything on it, it looked like it was brand new. I turned it on and was scared because the weather was set to Tajuana which I was concerned it was from out of the country BUT it wasnt and I went to Verizon and literally the guy put in my old sim card, did a test call and BAM was all set! The battery life is amazing lasted 2 days before it needed to be charged and I fully charged it took off charger and lasted another 2 days so far. It came with a fast charger cord, sim card pin to open slot area and wall plug for cord. I am extremely happy with my purchase, was worth the money and will definitely consider buying another phone from this seller. I will also say I was nervous based on reviews but I had not one issue and with it being a certified Amazon renewed seller I had faith I was getting what I ordered and if not they would back me up to help with getting what I ordered. The Camera Guyz are great sellers even provided instruction and a return slip instruction if I was not happy with the phone. If you are consider buying from them I would recommend you do.

It included the phone, tool to open the sim car/SD card slot, charger cord and wall plug inside the box.. immediately I powered it and got it linked up very quickly and effortlessly. I inserted my sim card and boom it was good to go!! It works with Spectrum mobile whom is a MNVO carrier and uses Verizon networks - it works flawlessly for me. This phone does have other settings for LTE/CDMA, LTE/GSM/UMTS and global. The phone was brand new and the white pearl iridescent color is so chique and shiny....it is a cutesy for sure. I opted for a clear case because I want to see the beautiful color of this pjone at all times. Since having this phone, I was able to explore so many of the Samsung features and there are tons. My favorite so far are the emoji characters and camera/video options I can use to bring them to life. This phone keeps my daughter occupied for hours when she plays with the emoji characters!!!This phone is jam packed with so many features and things to keep me entertainedfor hours on end.

Pleasantly surprised,"I'm just not the type who will spend $1200 for latest/bleeding edge gadget, but my old phone was so slow that I feel like I had to upgrade. For the price, I did not expect much from this phone, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised at the condition and performance of this refurbished phone. I watched and read a few reviews before buying and most of the reviews rave about how this phone is still a good buy, even in 2021. The exterior condition is very good, the battery life is decent (lasts me the whole day), the speed/performance is much better than what I had before, the camera is excellent. For the price, I'm very happy with this purchase, even though it's not the latest/greatest kid in the block, it will serve me a few good years.Totally recommend this for anyone who's looking for a well-performing budget phone and feel like the latest models of this type would just hurt too much.",2021年8月15日 在美国审核

Battery and charging issues,"The phone performed well. However after a few weeks of having it, I noticed that there were battery issues. Just a week ago before I returned the item. The phone kept restarting itself whenever I turned it on. Finally while at 27%, the phone just shut off and would not turn back on. I tried using different charging cables to see if it would charge, but the screen would quickly display a charging logo, then the entire screen would start to turn dark red and burned out.As a supervisor, I use my phone a lot to communicate.So since this phone was not workingI was forced to buy a new phonefrom the store the same day it stopped working and was left with no other choice then to return this one.",2021年5月6日 在美国审核

Purchased from RePhoned,"This phone works like a DREAM!!!!Firstly it came in even better condition than I expected with ONLY a couple very light very thin scratches on the back. As I turned it on and inserted my Sim card it didn't immediately accept it, but once I updated and restarted the device it was a non issue.After that it's pretty much been perfect bio-metrics work great!My one and only gripe which really isn't a big deal because it's within the advertised range is the battery life. I downloaded an app called accubattery which placed the battery's health at 88%. It's more than likely I'll just swap out the battery for a new one but other than that, GREAT PURCHASE. GREAT DEVICE.

Fantastic phone!,"This is probably the best phone I've ever gotten! The HTC is a high quality phone that can even compete with the iPhone 6, for a 3rd of the price.Let's talk about the physical. The phone has a super sleek, thin design and a shiny metal casing. The speakers are on the front, which is great for an avid YouTube watcher/music listener like me, and they are pretty loud and great quality. The one thing about the HTC one'sthat I don't like is the method of extracting the SD card or Sim card. It takes pushing a needle into a tiny hole to try to push out a slot. Little bit of work, but it's not a huge deal.The HTC one has a bevy of great software features. It has an android operating system. Further, the camera is super high quality and features amazing software such as Zoe, to take picture taking to the next level. The phone has amazing battery life as one charge can last me about 8 hours on full charge. The cpu is a high performing one as I rarely ever see lag when using the phone. The one software feature that I would love to see from this phone however is a better immersion screen. The buttons are on screen and can often make it smaller. It would be nice to have more immersion support so that things aren't so small.All in all, it's a great phone with a fantastic design and great software. It is lacking in some areas, but not enough to lose a star on its rating.",2016年5月20日 在美国审核
A quality refurbished phone,"Bought a refurbished phone. It is unlocked, though it does show the T-Mobile log-in screen and has a few apps from them. The phone has worked very well, especially considering it's not new. I use Cricket, which runs from AT&amp;T, so it worked with this phone which is based on GSM sim cards. My only dealings are with the gallery highlights, which shows all of your photos in a top tile. There's no way to disable it. BlinkFeed/HTC Sense would also pop up often, which was an inconvenience. However, the front facing speakers and how good the phone feels outweigh these issues.",2016年2月19日 在美国审核

This is the PHONE,"I just received the phone today and it is just marvelous. Before I used Galaxy S3 and Note 3, they just don't give you the feeling, after holding this one in hand, you feel that you have made the right choice. Plastic material is not for the phones, i just feel being amused by Samsung after all. The most striking part with this phone is the audio speaker. Ok, the camera is not its best but it is just enough for a phone at this time of tech. Compared to Iphones, the build quality is comparable, but as this device gives you a powerful android without any lags so way more flexible then IOS system which limits you all the time. I was waiting for LG G3 for its Quad HD screen, but this phone has a great one as well. I don't want to hold a plastic any more.So my opinions in brief:Pros:- Audio Speaker quality, boom sound- Built quality- Great front camera- Android is smooth- Better interface HTC Sense 6Cons:- mediocre camera system",2014年6月5日 在美国审核
One of the best phones around,Fantastic phone. Screen is gorgeous and even though it's 'last gen' to the m9 I'm not hurting for anything processor-wise.Put a 128 GB micro SD and have more capacity than the iPhone 128 GB model. Everything is snappy and it's updated (AT&amp;T) to Lolipop.IR blaster in the phone and the Sure universal remote software subscription (Play Store - Tried everything else and it doesn't compare to Sure's software) replaced ALL my remotes.The speakers on this thing is fantastic!Makes myNote 2 and iPhone 5 sound like COBY vs BOSE.Build quality is astounding - all metal - and the screen is gorgeous.My only gripe is the sound quality via headphones isn't as good as my Galaxy Note 2 (Bass not as pronounced). Since I mostly listen to podcasts on my phone this is not an issue.For music I usually use my Sansa Clip+ for great fidelity on the go.,2015年9月9日 在美国审核

"4 stars for the phone, ZERO for Breed (the seller)","EDIT: Nov. 14, 2017: I've resorted to flashing the ROM.It wasn't easy.HTC actually has ROMs and tools to flash the phone, wherein you could supposedly flash the T-Mobile ROM (or other carriers) and have it work, but I kept getting the error that I did not have the correct ROM selected.Ultimately I bought a tool to turn off security (""s-off"") and was able to install the Google Play Edition of Android.My messaging now gets pictures, I can create a hot-spot, the annoyances are gone.I will repeat, this is a great phone for the money - hobbled by being ""kind of"" locked and tied to AT&amp;T.I don't regret it, but will warn anyone who wants to try it took hours of reading and downloading GBs of data to my PC - ROMs and tools, and nothing worked quite like described in all the posts that supposedly were walking you through it.Not for the faint of heart, although knowing what I know now, I could probably do it in under an hour.EDIT: Nov. 8 2017: I've also discovered that, in order to get voicemail, I have to re-enter my phone number every time.Again, I think the phone is excellent; the seller (BREED) was deceptive by not telling people these are AT&amp;T phones, were configured by AT&amp;T (AT&amp;T's ""flavor"" of Android), and that they will not work as expected on other networks.EDIT: Nov. 6 2017: So now I've had this for a couple more days, and it gets worse.I've selected T-Mobile as my provider, but every time I get to an area where there's no service (like deep in the bowels of the building I work in), it starts popping up the network provider screen, asking me to select one.In addition to images not downloading through normal account messaging, I am unable to create a mobile hot-spot.In short, if you don't have AT&amp;T, don't get this phone (at least from Breed... there are other sellers, YMMV). In addition, it's got an AT&amp;T logo on the back (NOT shown in the pictures) and the phone ID stickers are affixed to the back of the phone instead of on the box.I think the phone may be used because of that, and the fact that the plastic peel off sheet that usually covers the screen was not there (the phone was otherwise in a protective pouch, and I did not see any other indications that the phone was used).Again, the phone itself is great - that it's not really network ""neutral"" seems to be a problem.ORIGINAL:Yes - there are issues if you don't have AT&amp;T as a carrier, but otherwise it's a great phone.I have T-Mobile as my carrier, currently and, so far, this is my experience:1) AT&amp;T apps that you can't get rid of.2) Mobile data did not work at all at first, I had to manually add an APN (google T-Mobile APN should get you on the right track).3) Images don't want to download in messaging app.I've tried an alternate message app (Google's ""Messages,"" and it still doesn't work).Ignoring the first one because I really just don't care, the second one was a minor pain that, once fixed, has been functioning OK since.That last one is crucial.Over the past few months, before getting this phone, I have been switching over to Google Voice.I've had it for years, but was not actively using it until recently.Using Google Voice, there is no problem with messaging at all - images come across just fine.However, that's a might big work-around for some people, and if I hadn't already gotten most of my friends and family to start connecting to me though Voice, it would have been a big issue to not get images.I also have an issue where, if I lose service (which I do deep in the bowels of the building where I work), it gets confused about which network to try to reconnect to, even though I've explicitly selected T-Mobile.Not a huge issue - as soon as I'm back in an area with service, it's OK, but when it happens I could be playing a game or typing a message, and the phone pops up a screen to select a network provider.The phone itself has been great, though.I'm coming from a larger phone that made me realize I want a PHONE and not a tablet in my pocket.It's still a good size, the display is pretty good - not UHD, but more than adequate for a screen this size.Pictures are also pretty good - not the greatest.The biggest plus for me is memory, because no matter how much Micro-SD you can add, there's always stuff that won't allow you to move it to the SD card and I run out of space with 8 or 16MB.The mobile antenna must also be pretty good, because I'm more likely to get that one bar in my workplace where my other phone would never work (and the other phone I'm replacing is actually a newer phone, being released a full six months after the HTC was released).It's got an actual headphone jack, and the charging port is SUPER tight.Our other phones - Samsung and LG, the charging ports were quite loose by comparison, and if you used the phone while it was charging, that often led to problems, including wearing the tines on micro USB plug and causing charging problems.I've had to buy many new USB cables over the years - they start off great, but eventually won't work with those phones.This plug is so tight, I can't imagine it being a problem.So if you don't need a ""phablet,"" and you realize that spending $1000 on a phone that you'll likely replace in a couple of years is a waste of money, I think you could do a lot worse than this HTC.I haven't had it long, but I will come back and edit this review if I encounter more problems.So far, though, pretty happy after working around the problems.",2017年11月5日 在美国审核

"SUB-PAR PHONES!! (CRAP PHONES, to be honest.)","***BEWARE** This seller is selling sub-par, allegedly refurbished phones. I bought an HTC for $200 and problems started right away. We requested a replacement, and the obliged me and sent one out. This one is as bad as the first, if not worse. I can get no 4G away from home, and we know it's the phone because my phone company tried the sd card in one of their phones and it worked perfectly. Them it started glitching everywhere, first with Google maps, which I cannot use at all, then with the camera, I get a couple pics in and it glitches there too. The only way to get it to stop glitching is to turn the phone off and back on...but 3 pictures later I have to shut it down again. It also gets waaaay too hot when charging. I can only charge it during the day because I worry it will catch fire while I am sleeping. I am not a rich person, a $200 phone is a luxury for me and I was so excited because I'd had a couple of bad metro pcs phones, and I assumed, wrongly, that you get what you pay for. Obviously they don't know crap one about refurbishing phones. THIS SELLER IS MAKING PROFITS OFF OF CRAP PHONES. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone!!

The phone is extremely slow to respond with the otter box!! It's a nightmare! Does provide good storage and you can put in a sd card for more storage. Takes decent pictures, volume is questionable sometimes. The volume goes down ALL the time and it randomly sends phone calls to voicemail without ringing at all or rings once!! That is sometimes problematic. Battery life is average, nothing exceptional by any means. Also randomly goes into Do not disturb mode. This phone has been nothing but agitating and I really feel like I completely wasted my money!! This in no way reflects the company I bought it from tho. Company is great!

"won't update software version or apps, can't find apps I.e. snapchat to download at all, swipe doesn't work right","Absolute trash. Many applications do not work on the phone, and for whatever reason the phone cannot even find apps in the app store that my previous m8 had on it; such as snapchat, microsoft office, etc.The most current software number/version available for the m8 is 6.12.1540.4. The version on this phone is 4.28.502.8 and when you check for an update it says that the phone is completely up to date and that you can check back in 24 hours to check for updates again.Manual updates are also impossible. HTC sync manager will not recognize the phone. I tried uninstalling and re-installing htc sync manager on my computer, and then going to my friend's hose for help (who writes applications for android market and works with computer programming for a living) and had the same problem. We tried just downloading the ROM and opening it in hopes that it might work without connecting to htc sync manager for whatever reason. No such luck. It would seem to work, and say that the update should take about 10 minutes. The phone would go to a screen that just says ""HTC"" with a black background during this time. We left the phone for hours and nothing happened. We tried updating in fast boot mode, turning fast boot mode off, restarting the phone, and everything else he could think of.Also, swipe is garbage even when it works right, and it doesn't work right on this phone. I'll get halfway through a word and it puts a different word in before I lift my finger or it will randomly move where I'm placing the word somewhere above where I left off in a sentence/paragraph. It sometimes even moves the word to a completely different area. For example, as I tried to type in the heading section for this post it tried to put words in random places in this main section... Garbage trash of a phone. How? How?I did a factory reset on the phone and will be returning it to go buy some other phone.",2017年11月30日 在美国审核
Research this type of phone,"I have issues with this phone.

Best Android Phone of 2014 and probably the best phone of all for this year!,"I am delighted with this amazing phone. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy S3 i747, I got tired of it due to the slow response, bloatware and overall performance issues. The HTC One M8 is amazing, not only on the design, quality and look but also with its performance, screen, speed, software, speakers, sound quality, clarity of voice call, multitasking, camera (rear and front), screen size, resolution, etc. etc. etc. There hasn't been a single day in the last 2 months that I have had the phone that have presented any issue, synchronization, software bug, slow response, crash, etc., even when I leave a lot of apps running in the background, this is a true multitasking phone that will comply with all of your demands in memory, speed, processing and responsiveness in any way. The battery duration is real good. I have used it heavily during the whole day and it will have to be recharged after 10 to 12 hours after heavy use (LTE, screen, games, videos, music streaming), and it has 2 power save modes: Moderate (dim the screen 20 to 30%) and extreme which will make the phone basically with basic functions with screen in B&amp;W to have battery enough for calls and some notifications.The only feedback is that the camera on the Samsung Galaxy S5 is slighter better and waterproof, but otherwise in overall specifications this phone is excellent and I'll tell you why: It doesn't have bloatware from the operator, its SIM lock free and has all the 3G and LTE bands to use it in the US and Latin America.Let's see if Apple can really beat Android Phones this time (with the upcoming ""iPhone 6""), which I doubt, because if they do....the phone will cost a real fortune -as usual- and then....Apple will discontinue your phone with an ""iPhone 6S"" in a couple of months...Bottom line: Best Phone of 2014!",2014年7月30日 在美国审核

"Apple and Android users, HTC one is MORE than just a beautiful device","Many people are like me, switching to an Android device could be quiet a big decision. I have always been a big supporter of iOS and iPhones. Android to me has always been a faceless copycat of iOS. My girlfriend's horrendous experience with MyTouch only deepened my hate for Android phones. My firm believe in Apple was only shaken after I realized that I robotically bought iPhone 5 without even giving it much thought. I felt like I was really excited but didn't know what was I excited for. After a just year of using iPhone 5, I could no longer tolerate its lack of customization and jokingly small screen. I started to explorer other options. Out of my phones on the market, the first generation HTC One stood out the most. Although I didn't pull the trigger on the first generation, I was certainly dazzled by its incomparable beauty.I bought my HTC One M8 on launch date after checking out a variety of reviewers online. It is one of the most critically acclaimed smartphones out there and those claims are consistent and to me, true. It is hard to not like the exterior as very few cellphones are made with such attention to detail and the whole phone feels just very good in my hands. The newest Android and the the new sense were very kind to a noobie Android newcomer like me. Even though I am somewhat a tech geek, it took me very little time to become fluent with the new Android kitkat. The new expansion slot makes larger storage versions of HTC almost waste of money. The speaker deserves the hype. At this point, it's almost a joke for the phone makers still use any kind of non-stereo speakers. The crystal clean screen is such a dramatic improvement over the iPhone 5 simply because of its size. Navigating through apps and making phone calls never experience lags thanks to the powerful snapdragons.The camera gets the most hate on the new HTC and honestly I don't know why HTC couldn't up the specs to be on par with other flagship phones. But most people, and I mean perhaps more than 95% of smartphone users, the lack of high pixel density makes very little difference in real life. People nowadays share filter processed photos on Instagram and Facebooks and these photos, especially the ones that are filtered, will likely not experience any pixel related problems. The only time m8 camera is a problem is when you have to print it out. So do not let this be a lame reason not to get this amazing phone.As with anything, the HTC one m8 might not be for everyone, but I encourage anyone who is slightly interested in switching from Apple to Android or Android geeks to hold the HTC One in your hands and feel the metal kissing your palms in the most beautiful way.",2014年6月21日 在美国审核

Excellent overall,"I'm really happy I chose this phone instead of the galaxy s5.I used to have a galaxy s4 and now that I have this oneI can really appreciate the difference when holding the phone: this one feels sturdy and made of quality materials, unlike the plastic feeling you get when holding most other phones.The interface is simple and elegant, without the extra apps that Samsung puts as part of their OS, making Android run very smoothly. The only thing I miss from my old s4 is the option of swiping over a contact to make a phone call or send a message directly, but otherwise I would pick this cleaner Android version over Samsung's every time.The camera is not the best. It takes nice low light pictures (a lot better than the s4) but otherwise the colors are just not as bright and pictures don't have as much detail (4 ""ultrapixels"" is just not enough). If you care a lot about taking pictures with your phone and cropping them afterwards, this is not the phone for you.If you are not into taking photos, but care a lot about having a durable and nice looking phone, running Android smoothly without the overloaded, kind of clunky interface of the galaxy sX (heart rate monitor... really??), this is definitely the phone for you and I can guarantee you will never even notice the ""missing"" features when comparing it to the s5.",2014年8月21日 在美国审核

Not as great as I thought,"It's a wonderful design, very light &amp; I've gotten plenty of compliments. But ever since I purchased this factory unlocked Verizon HTC M8 I have had minor issues that has increased over the past year. First month of having the phone I experienced problems with speakers. It would only last a few seconds but I later found restarting the phone would correct it. I found online numerous times update Android &amp; it should help. There wasn't an issue with performance of software it was the hardware which were the speakers. As for the past 6 months or so it's at the point where if my battery became low my phone would not work properly whenever I open apps it closes automatically &amp; it has become frustrating. I really love this phone because it's not to overly extensive but it's also not one to sleep on but now my speaker where I listen to callers has completely gone out. In order to receive interaction I have to have my phone on speaker to hear. I do not want to go around with my conversations blasting as if I'm on a housewives reality show or something. I just want the product description I was sold to work.",2015年10月9日 在美国审核

I switched from using a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active to this phone vs. keeping with the galaxy phones because I wanted a change and I liked that you can add a lot of external storage to this phone. The camera is good and has a lot of cool editing features for pictures and a lot of cool features while taking pictures like the 3D room view mode. It is a very fast phone even with a lot of pictures and videos (although I do have an SD card in mine). The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it seems to have a connectivity issue with playing bluetooth music through my 2014 Chevy Cruze. I researched this and it seems everyone else also has this problem with this phone, so it is not just my phone. The problem is that when it plays music, it starts skipping the sound on every song which is really annoying. I think I fixed this issue by having my phone only connected bluetooth audio versus having bluetooth audio and calls and texts. Overall, very good phone with a good operating system and good picture taking capabilities.",2015年4月29日 在美国审核

Great phone - love it,"Love this phone. I had a rezound for a few years and an HTC incredible prior to that. So, I am quite happy with HTC products - I do like their design. They are not known for keeping the software up to date and I was tempted to stay away this time. However, this phone's design is fantastic. HTC also has improved the software updates and with the HTC assurance program, they promise OS updates within 90 days of Google's release - with the play and developer edition getting them first.Full disclosure-I returned the product purchased at amazon since I was able to buy the same phone from HTC website with a 20% discount during christmas.Regarding the phone - Fantastic bright screen and resolution. Great sound from the speakers. Voice quality is very good. Phone is very responsive. I am a techie and try to fine tune my gadgets to keep them clean and running smoothly. I had previously rooted my rezound to get rid of bloatware. Didn't have to worry about bloatware on this one. I use a 64GB sandisk micro sd card to carry my music and also to save all photos. Camera quality is great - it is no comparison to a DSLR but the quality is very acceptable. Haven't played too much with zoe and other bells that HTC provides.

The thing which is mentioned not anywhere is that it requires a nano SIM card. So be prepared to get one of those.Ofcorse the m9 is bigger and better but also more expensive.

"Excellent value for the money, along with great service!!","Before I start reviewing this product, if you want to change the screen or the battery on your phone, take it to a professional!!! Also, please pardon the punctuation, as I'm dictating this review.With that out of the way, this was an excellent bargain. I had an HTC phone exactly like this, and you can guess by my previous comment what happened to it. The seller did a fantastic job of picking out a phone that looked brand new, save for a few minor scratches where the power plug goes in the phone. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I had received earbud headphones and a power cord with an adapter for A/C current. Shipping was very quick, and the seller responded almost immediately to some questions. I only requested that the screen be clear and not have any scratches , and that is what I got, plus more! Granted, I had to get my own specific screen covers for this model , but they are cheap and I had some already (I would recommend getting at least a 64 GB micro memory card , too). While the advertisement said the phone is unlocked, it came with an AT&amp;T logo stamped on it . While that's not a problem for me, as I'm going to go with a T-Mobile pre-paid account, Verizon will not allow an AT&amp;T phone on their network . You might want to verify with the seller if there are any logos stamped on the phone before you buy it, as that can severely limit your choice of carrier . These are NOT refurbished phones , but USED phones. When the seller said that the condition was like new, it was like new . I really wanted this particular model of smartphone. it does and a lot of things thatmost other smart phones do not do. Be warned! If this is your first smartphone, it will be a bit difficult to learn how to use. However, once you learn how to use the device, you can use it for almost anything, including a remote control for your TV. Don't worry about not having an instruction manual sent with the phone-- there's one on the Internet . I have that particular page bookmarked, and I use it a LOT!! LOL I would definitely work with this seller again. I got more than my money's worth for an excellent price. I was really surprised to see such a good quality phone for the price that I paid.It's worth an extra $40 to have a professional install a new battery if that is something you want to do. Please learn from me,and don't try to install a battery yourself, unless you know how to do it. Watching a YouTube video does not constitute ""knowing how to do it"". I don't know why they quit making this model of phone. It does so many things and has great sound when it's not plugged into any kind of amplifier . I compared it to a Samsung , and I decided that the Samsung name was the only thing that was raising their price compared to HTC . Of course, the phone cannot do things that the current phones can do , such as capturing videos when you take photographs . If you want to spend $800 to over $1000 for a cell phone, that's your business , but I think this was an excellent phone for the money , but ONLY as a USED phone. It pays to shop around, and to research what an individual device is capable of doing .",2016年3月8日 在美国审核

Many have complained about the camera but I have no picture quality issues. I'm very satisfied with the output (mostly pics of my kids - 50% outdoors 50% indoors). It may not technically be faster than the GS5, but it definitely feels faster.If you're on the fence, get it. It's worth it.For the record, another reviewer said this was the AT&amp;T model.

"Phone was OK for a while, did I get a lemon?","I thought I was making a good decision buying this phone. I started my smartphone purchases with a Nokia E71 (it was smart, it had WiFi!), then moved on to the original Galaxy, and then to the Galaxy S3. I was going to get the S5, but I didn't see enough updates between S3 to S5 to justify the upgrade. All the phones prior this have been rugged (put through much abuse, with NO CASES) and never failed to operate.After a few weeks of owning this phone, I noticed the camera is definitely worse that the Galaxy S5 (a friend owns). After some digging online i found I had to scrub the damn camera lens with toothpaste to clear up some sticky muck from the factory!!!!The camera started to look a bit better after that, but not perfect.Then the kicker, my WiFi range was reduced to just 10 feet from a wireless router. After a month of testing, restoring factory defaults, I decided to call HTC and complain of a hardware issue. I sent the phone in for repair and they said up to 10 days. I am now 3 weeks into repair and still no phone. I might update this review in the future with a (hopefully) positive outcome.Maybe I just got a lemon? I don't know, just think twice about this thing.",2014年11月19日 在美国审核

I use it for about 14 hours, about 1-1.5 hour of talk, and about 2 hours of screen time for internet etc... and sometimes a short navigation with waze. still I finish the day with 20-40% battery left without charging or even without turning power saving mode (not to mention extreme power saving mode which I never use)the screen is very good, I think that the size is better than the bulky lg g3 because even though the total size is the same, I dont think I could reach the top and bottom areas on the lg g3 which are used for bezels on the htc.sound is amazing, dont expect something to loud but the quality is very good and the volume is better than my last galaxy s3.camera - I use it for fun pictures and enjoy the easy editing modes, I find it working most of the times! otherwise I use my DSLR for photos I like to print big so I dont care about the low MP, as for the video - I use it for taking videos of the kids and its as good as any other video cam.overall - I enjoy this phone and am happy that I left samsung galaxy for it.",2014年7月7日 在美国审核
Came with some annoying Verizon apps which is to be expected,"Got it from brotherhood services as a Verizon unlocked refurbished phone.Came with some annoying Verizon apps which is to be expected. Thankfully you can make them disappear (hide) though I don't think you can uninstall them.As described, there were minor scratches on the back, which is fine by me as I use a cover anyway. The charging port had some scratching and decoloration on it (which is to be expected) The most important part: the screen was unscratched.Phone is fast and feels entirely new.My only complaint is that the package did not come with a release ""pin"" or ""needle"" to remove the sim card and micro SD card tray.

What we should expect from a flaship,"My 3 previous cellphones were: Nexus 4, Nexus 4 (fist one had screen broken after a fall), Moto X Dev Edtion, Sony Xpezia Z1. What I can tell you is once you have a Moto X you get spoiled by all the Active Display and Wakeup features, that's why I mainly replace my Z1 by the HTC One M8. Device is beautiful, finish gorgeous. As for the UI, best closest to the Pure Android Experience.I'm not a big fan of Cam, so I really don't care about the downgrade from a 20.3 mp to a 4mp. The picture quality are good enough, bright, alive to share with others in smartphones or computers. Zoe is excellent, Boomsound is amazing comparing to the crappy sound/speakers from the Z1.If you're looking for a camera, by a Z1 or Z2. if you're looking for a nice smartphone, with nice UI and features, 6months screen replace for free, then get this HTC One.

"Avoid this and everything else sold by this seller ""Newtrends""","Hello all,This phone is defective - I have had the same problems indicated by other customers. The battery and ability to charge and/or hold a charge are all malfunctioning. The problem did not get to the point of recognizing something was wrong until after 30 days, and thefirst few weeks were fine. Then it just day by day deteriorated and is now barely functional.However, the worst part is the customer service from this company - Newtrends. Even though it is obvious a phone costing close to 300 dollars should last well over a year, and that this one dying after about four weeks means they need to replace or refund immediately, they simply wrote that it was too bad but they are not going to do a darn thing!However, the even worst part is that Amazon denied my claim!!!!!! I have been an excellent customer for many years andit is obvious to any of these Amazonians who check my history that I do not make claims except once in a blue moon andfor always good reason. The denial is the most annoying and unreasonable part of the whole thing, since the failure ofthe phone clearly is within the ""A to Z"" guarantee terms. Arrrggghhh!Here is what I wrote to Amazon:The item I received was damaged, defective, or materially different from the item represented on the product detail page and this defect was not evident until after 30 days. I have filed within the 90 day limit. The defect is not digital, but related to thebattery and charging aspects of the phone.It is completely unacceptable that the claim was denied. I demand further action since this device was sold in a condition that the seller must have known it would fail after 30 days. There are other purchasers on Amazon who are having the EXACT same problemwith this phone, I notice.Also, my customer experience for many years shows that I do not make spuriousclaims, ever. This is a legitimate fault on the part of the seller. Please put me intouch with your supervisor if you cannot resolve this to my satisfaction (i.e. full refund).Your A to Z policy clearly covers this claim.

I have had several other Android devices so there are few surprises there. The HTC One M8 performs great. I have had only one problem, and while it was upsetting it was not anything Earth shattering. (The problem was the device resetting to factory settings when I attempted to remove an HTC installed system app.)I do have to admit to differing from most people in that I do not like all the social media apps, so most of these are disabled.

"Excellent and beautiful, sense could be improved","This phone is quite incredible really,having all the necessary elements of a tear one smart phone and lacking the painful and aggressive adaptations to android that have become so present, e.g. the Samsung camp.A 2.3 ghz processor,2 GB of RAM,32 GB with the ability to expand with a micro SD (which I did immediately to contain my music library), resident best speakers on a smartphone,sleak design,fast wireless ac connectivity, easy potential for an unlocked and rooted phone provided by HTC, and of course a stunning 1080p screen that is edging me towards a tabletless lifestyle.My only complaint is a very subjective one,which is an element of sense ui. Their native installation has a news app called blinkered which I happen to not be very fond of.It is speedy but after a couple of days I found it to be nothing more than a novelty.Also it consumed as much battery without being one of my home screens as the whole Android system did according to the power tab in settings.To me this and a couple of other elements of sense that were not as pleasant forced me to CyanogenMod the phone. With such an adaptation, you can add battery life to the above list of positives.Regardless,this phone is beautiful and backed by hardware to make me very happy with my decision.The software is the best I have tried among Android adaptations but I still like the more pure experience leagues more!",2014年7月5日 在美国审核

Awesome price on a apparently unused powerful smartphone with maximum flexibility regarding carriers,"The most cost efficient way of getting a great smartphone, ie get last year's model for about 298 bucks!It's fast, it works, IT'S UNLOCKED!!!!! and, even though the seller didn't sell it that way, it appears to be brand spankin' new!Even the power plug and the usb cable were still in their factory wrappers.Not a single scratch.And although this model is verizon banded, I use the t-mobile 30 dollar a month plan (5 gigs lte 100 minutes unlimited msgs) which is unbeatable(available only through some Wallmarts).I took it over to t-mobile and was told a similar offer from ATT on this phone would've been a problem because they lock their phones down - even when they say it is unlocked and I'd have to contact ATT for unlocking.I've noticed that LTE on t-mobile is not consistent enough to use where I live so I use the HSPA+ UTMS option.If you select the LTE, it eventually goes down all the way to 3g and edge, however using the legacy lte is the way to go when using t-mobile as you will almost instantly kick down to the available frequencies if LTE isn't available.Most likely you'd be using bwtn 3g and HSPA+(to get to this setting use settings &gt; Mobile data &gt; Preferred Network &gt; and you'll have three choices.The most flexible is LTE/legacy 3GPP mode which gives you a choice of GSM/GPRS/EDGE only Mode, UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+ only mode, or LTE only mode.UMTS/HSPA/HSPA+ provides the flexibility and most continuous connectivity I need.Also, although I am not using verizon as my carrier, connecting this sucker to a windows computer allows you to get all the upgrades via a verizon app.I am quite happy with this purchase and I have also purchased a powerbear battery case (on amazon) for protection and lots more battery life - two days ago it was 19 bucks today I see it is around 90....go figure.Real life with the screen.OK, yesterday I inadvertently pushed it off a table an it landed face down onto a concrete floor.(about 3 and a half feet or so).As I turned the phone over, expecting to see a shattered screen I was elated to see a screen with not even a single scratch on it.Apparently this gorilla glass 3 standard works pretty good - so glad about that!",2015年4月15日 在美国审核
Honest Opinion after 2 years,"Ok, pushing onto 2 years now? Maybe more?Verdict:PROS:Phone has performed exceptionally well.Still kicking strong even when running new apps.Updated android version works great.Sound quality is AMAZING! Much better than having one speaker located under the phone. Perfect for watching movies or blasting tunes. Sound feels decently balanced for a phone. 5/5. If fact, music is what I do all day for the last year. This phone deserves a nice medal.Straight out of the box, I had NO problems migrating data from an old Samsung to this.The screen is perfectly crisp. Colors feel acceptable 4/5.That brushed aluminum feel does not get old.Camera is great. Takes beautiful pictures and the panoramic room view is lots of fun. I use this camera more than my canon company given one when reporting items for work and this works perfectly. There is a CON to the camera however.CONS:Twice now I've had the phone overheat when charging. To the point where I felt my chest burn which woke me up in the morning. Sorry, but this is a No-no experience which keeps the phone from getting 5 stars. The phone was not covered up, and the charger being used was the standard charger it came with. Unfortunately it's fallen apart faster than the phone.Secondly, the camera is no good when it comes to low lighting. This was my complaint with the HTC M7 where the low light pictures were pink/purple. For this camera, it just feels like a darker purple. Really disappointed in this.Battery life - For the first year, it was great. Second half- The phone barely get's through the day. And I don't use it that much. Pushing 5-10% by the time I get home at the end of the day.Overall, I really am happy with this phone.

"Awesome phone, truly one of the best","I got this as a replacement for my Galaxy S II which unfortunately went dead after 3 years of faithful use, I've been using it for 2 weeks now and comparing it to my old phone you can tell the upgrades in the package, in terms of speed and processor, I've been playing quite ab it of game on it (something I couldn't do on my old phone due to space issues) the 32GB is more than enough for the applications and the games I've got (100+ apps usually).Now speaking for the most differentiating things we got in this phone is boom sound and the double camera, regarding the sound it is awesome I had read the it was great but you can really tell how good until you hear it by yourself, I truly can not understand why they hadn't thought of placing speakers on the front before and such awesome speakers. As for the camera itself sure many other phones got 12+ megapixels but there is a point in which you don't need that many pixels (unless you plan on printing a lot of posters) but for everyday use the pictures are quite clear, the colors are great, it is quite a good picture.

Started off great for a first smart phone... but the battery ended up causing problems later on.,"I thought I wrote a review for this a long time ago when I got it but I guess I just was waiting to try it out before reviewing it and ended up forgetting to review it.When I first got this phone I bought it unlocked way back when it first came out back in 2014 for about $800! ($600 for the phone and another $100 for a SD card for added storage).Now that's quite a bit of money for the first smart phone you get. Before this I was used to having crappy old flip phones which all I used them for was calling family sometimes.It started off great and worked really well. It looks nice and all that. Had a lot of cool features (though some I never really used). I got the unlocked version cause I didn't want bloated wear on my smartphone right off the bat buying it through a phone carrier like verison, at@t etc. Thus the $600 price tag which nowadays you can buy a new one for under $200 which is kinda annoying considering how it's only 4 years old. But that's how technology is these days. This year however I started coming to the realization if my phone ever broke or something I would like to have a backup (though a nice cheaper one) available until I could buy a new one so I started looking earlier this year and couldn't really find any that great (they all had their own downsides). Also most new unlocked smartphones will be around $600-800 range which is still to pricey for something most companies want you to replace every year or every other year.Now this past month I noticed the screen was bulging out in the middle but not on the ends (where the speakers are located) and at first thought maybe it was my protective cover I put on it a few months ago but it appears as if the battery has gone bad. 4 years is pretty long for most smart phones to last but seeing some of the reviews on here are mentioning bad battery life just a few months after getting it so that's pretty bad. On-top of that a family member who decided to follow my route bought the same kind of phone shortly after I did and had been noticing it getting pretty hot when trying to use it and being told by a phone ""expert/technician"" that it means the battery is gone bad and you need a new one.I am kinda upset that I need to fork over close to a grand AGAIN for a smart phone. I was hoping this would last longer but I guess 4 years isn't that bad. It still works and seems to hold a charge for now but iv seen people mention other places that you should be very careful to charge it cause it could explode. :SAn extra thing to note that I just noticed (which seems to have happened recently like in the past month as well) is the charging cord that it came with is already starting to frey near the connector. This is probably because they designed the cord (that came with the phone mind you) really badly in that it's very difficult to get a good grip on it with a finger and thumb to pull it out of the phone. There was at least a few times I know my grasp slipped and it ended up being pulled out by the cord instead (which I didn't want to do).I was thinking of getting another HTC but earlier this year when looking at their current offerings nothing seemed to really get my interest. There was one maybe (don't remember to well) that seemed like they finally put a decent camera on it and everything. However, it had just came out and was still way to pricey and figured id wait to maybe buy it later. But so far I see on HTC's US website they only show 3 phones they are supporting currently (or at least selling) and they don't look like the one I saw before so that means I might have to look elsewhere cause those phones look awful (they got rid of the head-phone jack and are following the stupid design apple and them are doing).I really wanted to go with another HTC since at least this one lasted 4 years but it seems I might have to look elsewhere. This is a shame because of the fact that there really is only a handful of smartphone companies these days.. and HTC isn't really one of the top dogs. Apple, samsung, LG, oneplus, google pixel, Motorola (kinda), and HTC maybe.I heard on some sites you can have the battery replaced if you send it into HTC but it will cost you $200. For a phone I spent $800+ on (2 protective cases, a holster, protective screen cover etc.) I don't really want to spend more because of a problem on their end. Maybe it is that those batteries only last 4 years and that's it? Idk I am not like most people who replace their smart phone each year.I just looked into the HTC one m9 and m10 and both seem to have problems with battery and/or bricking up. Really looks like ill have to look elsewhere for a decent smart phone which is a shame. After reading some of the one star reviews it makes me glad mine hasn't bricked up.... yet. But it does have me worried so now ill have to try and find a decent replacement soon otherwise I might have to risk losing a lot of stuff.Well I hope my review helped anyone looking. This phone might work for a few years for you for a temp. phone but then there is a chance it could go bad after just a short while either bricking up or the battery going bad.

keep shopping,"Having placed my order on Saturday with 2 day shipping I was expecting to receive it Tuesday or Wednesday.It was scheduled to arrive Thursday but did not come until Saturday.It arrived in a large box with no packing material just closed up in a bag with its charger.This is not a refurbished phone, it is a used phone.There is gunk in the sim card tray, scuffs in the case and scratches on the screen.I always keep my phones in cases so I never see this kind of wear myself. It looks like it lived in the floorboard of someone's car.However, the phone is pretty sturdy, so despite looking like it might have been run over, it seems to work fine.If you're making the switch from iphone to android, brace yourself for an extremely irritating soundscape and user-unfriendly interfaces.I picked this phone because it's supposed to be made by adults in some slightly more ethical manner but, especially used, it's basically the hair-shirt of phones, though not as bad as the LG.If you're going to buy the HTC buy it new or from someone else.update: Product support expires March 3rd, product ceases to work March 21st.It acts like the power button is being held down all the time.Apparently this is a common problem with these phones.you have been warned.",2018年1月13日 在美国审核
MegaCommerce and Edge Cellular: Unfortunate/bad luck twice,"This will be a review towards two manufacturers: MegaCommerce and Edge CellularIt's unfortunate that bad luck struck twice on me when trying to purchase an HTC One M8. The first purchase I made was ordering a refurbished HTC One M8 from MegaCommerce. It was supposed to arrive by April 7-12. I waited 5 days and had no word from the manufacturer; 'had to contact them myself notifying that I had waited over the time-span of arrival. My package was revealed to be lost/stolen... I guess there's nothing you can do about such a situation? But you had me anticipate an item for 5 days... Good job for nothing.I had the desire to own an M8, thus I searched... and purchased a refurbished HTC One M8 from Edge Cellular. Phone arrived with a subtle white mark on the screen. The mark can be overlooked if you're not a normal human being. Otherwise, it will give you OCD. The phone also had T-Mobile bloatware on it, and my 4G data from AT&amp;T is not working on it.Edge Cellular, if you're going to sell a phone with T-Mobile bloatware on it, I recommend you to sell it on the HTC One M8 page that is specifically for T-Mobile, not the Factory Unlocked version.Edit: So yeah, it's been over half a week now. My M8 can support calling and texts from another carrier, but using data from another carrier is a complete no go. Only At&amp;t and Verizon have their branding encrypted on the back of the phone, so mine looks like a stock HTC. But unfortunate that's an outright deceit. My phone can only support cellular data from T-Mobile, which is not my carrier.My recommendation to anyone who wants to purchase an M8 is to go for a New phone that doesn't specify any particular carrier. Hashing out that extra $$ is worth it. Otherwise you might just take a visit towards my experience.",2016年4月16日 在美国审核

"Decent phone for the price, but not a pure HTC phone (pre-configured for AT&amp;T)","I bought this as an unlocked GSM phone to be used with Consumer Cellular. I was disappointed to see that this phone had been pre-configured for marketing by AT&amp;T. That added another large layer of bloatware that is of no use to me, and cannot be uninstalled.

It was unlocked, and I did get it configured for use with Consumer Cellular, but I would greatly prefer a pure HTC version of the phone - which is what I thought I was buying.That said, it is a nice phone for the price. It is the fastest Android device I have owned so far, and it exceeds the capabilities of the Moto G I was previously using in many ways.

Worst part is the battery life almost nonexistent shuts off at random and anything below 50% the phone shuts off immediately.

I especially love how the audio speakers are placed in the front of the phone and the sound clarity is outstanding. Even now close to a month after owning this phone, the premium aluminum feel and look is pristine as when we first got it (but I highly recommend buying a case).

Best phone I have ever owned/used,"I don't even know where to begin describing all the ways this phone blows all others away.This phone is everything the tech sites boast it is and more. The processor in this thing makes a world of difference. Apps and widgets open in the blink of an eye, web pages load at blazing speeds and the phone boots up almost instantaneously. The last time I experienced such a leap in speed is when I first used my Samsung Galxy S3 and iPhone 4 after using a Blackberry Curve for so many years. The difference between the speed of the One M8 and S3 is like apples and oranges. A Ferrari 458 vs. a Hyundai Veloster.The display on the M8 is stunning. The screen on the this thing makes the one on the S3 look like a CRT display from 1998. And speaking of the display, my biggest (and best) surprise came when I used the phone outside in direct sunlight. To my amazement, I could see the screen perfectly, unlike my S3 (and other phones) which was impossible.The form factor of this thing is it's strongest quality in my opinion, and one of the reasons I picked this over a Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5s. You will be hard pressed to find a phone that looks this good AND feels this comfortable in your hand. I did notice the volume buttons felt a little loose, but it's not a deal breaker. The phone feels sturdy and ready for war, it feels like it won't turn to powder (iPhone 4, 4s) or dent (iPhone 5, 5s) if dropped. Although I would recommend getting a case to put it in. I haven't had any yet (*knocks on wood*), but I can see the potential for the back and sides of the phone getting minor nicks and scratches. I ordered the Spigen® [Non Slip] [AIR CUSHION] HTC One M8 Case and amFilm HTC One M8 Screen Protector 2014 Premium HD Clear. The case hasn't arrived yet, but I can say the screen protector is EXCELLENT. They weren't lying when they boasted about the clarity and protection this thing offers.The OS is great too. If you're familiar with Android operating systems, it won't be hard to adjust to this phone. Although it did take getting used to having no physical home button and navigating the menus, but that's not necessarily a bad thing (I like newness). The camera, despite what some apple fanboys and tech reviews claim, is actually really good. The images are clear and the colors are rich, and with a little tweaking of the settings, it can compete with any other camera (on a phone) out there.The battery is also a strong suit of the HTC One M8. I was initially worried about purchasing a phone that didn't have a removable back cover, but now I know it was for nothing. When I first opened the box, it had a 47% charge, which would have lasted me, but I decided to charge it fully. The next day, the phone only lost around 30-40% charge after more than 18 hours of light to moderate use (facebook, instagram, email, whatsapp, music, youtube and internet browsing). With heavy use, I can see getting at least 10+ hours. In standby mode, I can see this thing lasting weeks. Needless to say, the battery is great.Now, onto my only gripe about the HTC One M8, the speakers. Don't get me wrong, these are the best speakers on a phone that I have experienced, and having them facing forward makes a world of difference. When the volume is up, the speakers are very crisp, clear and bass rich. However, after reading so much about Boomsound, and then actually hearing the phone, I was honestly expecting a little more. I know that I have to take the audio file quality into account (which I do), but I wasn't expecting to have to turn the volume up to the level I did (almost max) to experience what HTC so proudly boasted about.After all is said and done, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants the best piece of pocket tech available.Pros:-Super fast-Very lightweight/excellent form factor.-Battery life is amazing.-Great display.-Can actually use the phone in sunlight!Cons:-Dual front speakers not as loud as I had hoped.-Volume buttons don't feel very well constructed.",2014年5月12日 在美国审核

"Quality, performance and optimization at its finest","After a month of use of the phone, I can resume it in few words, in case you don't wanna read the full review: The phone is built in excellent quality materials, has an excellent performance and the optimization of the components and software makes it last enough during the day so you won't need to carry a charger with you. If the camera is not a primary need for you, this is an excellent phone and I'd recommend it to anyone.Now if you're interested in a deeper review, here we go.-DesignThe HTC One M8 is, at least in my opinion, one of the best crafted android phones out there, the quality of the materials which is built can be noticed without even touch it, and once you have it in your hand the phone gives the feeling of a premium device, just what you're paying for, since it's not cheap at all.The sleek full aluminum body costs its price in the weight of the phone though, making it one of the heaviest smartphones out there, only comparable with the Sony Xperia Z2; I previously had a Galaxy S4, which is supposed to be way more lighter due to the materials difference, however in my personal experience it's really hard to have a S4 without a case and keep it intact, the plastic can be easily scratched and the material is a fingerprints magnet, so the weight it gains in favor of lighter materials, ends up being gained again for the case. After using the M8 for a month I can say the materials are good enough to not get scratches for normal use, and fingerprints are out of discussion.As a negative point I'd say as many others, the space in the front of the logo is completely unnecessary and only adds some dead height to the phone, however you can still navigate through all of the screen with a hand in most of situations with ease.In my personal opinion, the decision about putting the power button in the top at the phone is more than accurate, I lost count on how many times I turned screen on with my previous phone while I was putting in into the pocket cause I accidentally touched the button on the edge while holding it, this combined with the gestures to unlock the screen makes you forget about the lock button, which not makes it uncomfortable in the end.-ScreenThe M8 screen it's a beautiful screen, I was a bit worried about this cause I was used to the AMOLED displays from Samsung, but once used this one for a while I should say, in my personal opinion is way more better, because color saturation is more accurate to natural tones, except for some green tones, I don't know if it's because all of the time I've spent with AMOLED screens, but they seem way bright in the M8 screen, the first time was uncomfortable and still don't like how do they seem at all. An example of these green tones are present in the google play store in the apps and games buttons, I'll add some images later from the phone so you can appreciate it.In terms of brightness the M8 has a good brightness scale: the lowest brightness is enough to light the screen while you're reading in the dark without being annoying, and the highest one is too bright for my personal like in normal light situations (cause I don't like high brightness in my screens anyway) but it's enough to be able to watch the content of the screen against direct sunlight, which I appreciate a lot considering in the same conditions with my previous phone I was just able to see some purple brights most of the time.The automatic brightness could be improved later, looks so close to the highest brightness for my personal likes.-CameraThis was one of the things that kept me skeptical about the phone cause I heard a lot of complains about the first HTC One and the Ultra Pixel technology, so I was expecting ugly and blurry photos. I'm not a huge fan of photos and I don't take a lot of them with the phone, maybe I'm not the best person to make a review from it, but the ones I've taken seems fair enough for me, the colors are good, the camera is fast and results are decent. Off course, it has the limitations of what every 4 pixel camera (being ultra or mega pixel) could have, and it's the lack of detail and sharpness as soon as you start zooming the photo. However if you're gonna take pics just for selfies, casual food hipster photos and to send some images from whatsapp or facebook (which in whatsapp case are resized anyway) the quality of the photos are good enough, there is very detailed reviews about this at Internet if you need more info about it.Duo camera bring some interesting effects, some more polished than others, the most interesting for many people, ufocus, actually works, but it's not the most polished of them, I have to say in some situations the area is not well defined, but for general purpose will behave as you expect most of times.If it's true more mega pixels doesn't fully means a better camera, it's also true this one still lacks of the minimum required amount of pixels to be at pair with his competitors, I hope they find a way to add more pixels to the camera, this would make cover the weakest point of this phone.-AudioThis topic is with no doubt one of the shiniest for HTC, last year's One was way more ahead from the rest, and this year they've done it again. Frontal double speakers sacrifices some height from the phone, making it as tall as other with bigger screens, but the sound quality is out of discussion. This year Sony got close by bringing their speaker to the front as well which improved the audio, but I think HTC is still better, and I've seen some serious audio reviews which also thinks so, but in the end it's a personal preference, none of them are perfect.-Memory and BatterySince I was using the S4, I've never been able to fill up the memory, cause I tend to close what I'm not using, I'm not the most memory demanding user over there. If you feel like fitting in my profile, 2GB of RAM should be enough for you, and maybe most of people, since in the end few manufacturers gave the jump into the 3GB scale. I've been using around 10 apps in the background with no weird behaviors, everything works as expected.Before talking about battery duration let's define my usage patterns: daily usage includes web browsing, reading books and news, checking mail, social networks and sometimes playing some 3D games, which makes me a kind of heavy user.The battery was one of the things that impressed me more from this phone. My previous phone had a 2600 mAh, which used to last in average more than 3 and less than 4 hours of screen on before battery runs out, sometimes I was close to the 4 hours, in terms of hours without having to charge the phone that meant 8-10 hours on the heaviest use I gave it, 12 average and having power saving options on except for processor one, 14-16 on light use and around 20 hours using power saving additional options, being that the record I got with that phone.The HTC One M8 comes with a 2600 mAh battery too, in terms of screen on hours before the battery runs out, it lasts in average more than 5 hours and less than 6 and I've passed the 6 hours sometimes. In terms of hours without charging the phone, that's around 14 hours on heavy usage, 16-24 hours on lighter usage and up to 40 hours on weekends when I use the phone the less, without using any power saving option, and being my current record on this one. This 'no power savings' statement is a bit tricky though, cause the HTC One M8 turns power saving settings automatically when battery is lower than 15%, however if you consider my previous phone had them always on, it's a huge step forward for the same battery capacity, and this is where the optimization from title comes from.-SoftwareHTC sense is extremely non intrusive personalization layer,is fast, fluid and minimalist. The applications have these same patterns and tend to add some color to the equation (not so many for application though) this can be a good or bad thing, that depends on your likes, I'll add some screenshots of the apps later. I won't add benchmarks test to talk about performance cause they've been tricked some generations ago, but in normal use around this month I haven't experienced any heavy lag, or delay which makes the phone uncomfortable to use. The phone is fast, you can feel the difference between the sanpdragon 600 and the 800 series, it executes everything smoothly.Saying there's a phone with no lag at all anytime is a beautiful lie, I've seen random lags, freezes and delays even in iPhones; this is not the perfect phone, however they barely happen, at least with the time I've been using it and with the usage I've been making of it, you can't compare it to TouchWiz, that's miles ahead in terms of lag and delay competition, even if that's not a good thing.A real downside and a bad thing of this non intrusive UI I've found is, however, the lack of a default file explorer. Android doesn't has any, and HTC won't include anyone either. If you don't use a SD card in your phone that won't be any deal, you just need to pick the one you like more from the Play Store (there are a lot, with beautiful and polished UI and a lot of people make their default from there anyway), but if you have a SD card this will mean some problems and uncomfortable situations for you; since Android 4.4 Google restricted the SD card write access to only Google apps and the third party applications installed by the manufacturer, so not having a preset one or a google provided one, you won't be able to modify anything from the SD card without connecting the phone to a PC. This can be solved with root privileges, but if you understand what that means and the consequences it has, you'll understand that's a decision you need to make and prolly HTC won't like it if you need to claim your warranty.-MiscellaneousSomething I didn't like from this phone and I liked more from my previous one that it's not covered in everywhere else, is the notification LED. This one has only 3 colors: red when battery's low, green when it's fully charged, and an orange-like for everything else; maybe there's a setting to change this, or you could use an third party application for it, but so far I haven't found any setting.-ConclusionThe HTC One M8 is an excellent piece of engineering, nicely crafted with a good performance and optimization, which however has some flaws that can be improved, some by software, and some will need to be taken in consideration, hopefully, for the next generation's model, and if you're reading the conclusion after reading the review, we can conclude you're a very patient person :)Thanks for your time, hope this turns out to be helpful for you!",2014年5月28日 在美国审核

Charging port doesn't work,"When I first bought this phone, I had trouble getting it to charge.

If I managed to set the phone down and it didn't disconnect, it would charge so slowly that it really just slowed down the battery drain rather than charge the phone. I quickly emailed Edge Cellular, and they informed me that I should just send the phone back as a return and order a second one, which I did. When the second one came it seemed to work fine and all was well. This all happened in April, it is now September, and this replacement phone began acting just like the first one that came a few weeks ago. It's almost impossible to charge it at all and it's extremely frustrating. I don't know if it's a problem with the phone or the process of refurbishing the phone, but it's caused me a lot of grief over the past couple of weeks.

99% Compatible with ATT,"Send To: Y&amp;ECLOSEOUTS11/17 10:39:52""Hello,I purchased the HTC One M8 Factory Unlocked Smartphone with 32 GB Memory, Nano-SIM support and 5.0-Inch Display US Warranty (Gunmetal Grey) Order# --- - ------- - ----863 from your store a couple of months ago through Amazon. Overall I am incredibly satisfied with my purchase. The phone is fantastic, and the price was just in the range that I was looking for.My only issue came up recently when I was included in a group message. The phone was listed as being fully compatible with ATT as a provider, but for some reason my phone will not download the MMS messages for group messages and for pictures. I had activated the phone at the ATT store and they said there should be no issues getting a new SIM card and getting the phone working.When I took my phone to the store to try and get the issue of downloading MMS messages they told me that I had purchased a T-mobile phone. What I was told is that there are some small software nuances that make it so a T-mobile phone cannot access some ATT network features.I do not need a refund. I would just like to receive some feedback from the seller if there has been an issue before with a 'factory reset' phone not being able to be fully activated on a new provider. I have access to the other 99% of network capability such as checking e-mails and browsing the web. It is very inconvenient however to not be able to receive group messages and pictures.Thanks again for the great phone, and I hope that we can figure something out for getting me the full functionality of the phone that was expected.""I sent this message to Y&amp;E Closeouts close to a month ago and have still received no response. At this point I don't know whether to be frustrated or disappointed. If you have read the message above, and I hope that Y&amp;E Closeouts finally reads the message above, I really enjoy my phone. There is just the small problem that what was promised to me as part of the functionality of the phone is not present.Do not list ""Fully Compatible"" with ATT if the phone is NOT compatible with ATT in all aspects. Not being able to send pictures, and not being able to be a part of group messaging does not constitute fully compatible.",2016年12月16日 在美国审核

Additionally, although my local store verified that the phone was new, there were pictures belonging to someone else on the phone. There is the possibility that I was hacked, and that this was not a problem with the phone.If you are already planning on using it with T-Mobile then I would go for it, but I would hesitate if you have a different carrier.

Edge Cellular sold me a lemon.,"Edge Cellular gave me a sub-par product, with issues that showed outside of their 30 day policy.

As such, the charge only worked a certain way, the audio jack is useless, the screen will be dead very soon, with lines and dead spots already appearing, and scratching all over the bottom of the casing.The HTC One M8 is a fantastic phone, but the seller gave me a lemon that didn't show how rancid it was until I couldn't return it.Edge Cellular did the technological equivalent of putting sawdust in the gas tank.",2016年8月5日 在美国审核

waste of money dont buy,I really hate the fact that this phone has a microphone problem which comes two days after i purchased it. when ever i send voice notes through whatsapp messenger or make a phone call its very low to the point where the person on the line cannot hear what i am sayingat all. this is a very bad experience for me as i am over seas and leaving in a day so i cant send back the phone due to the time frame. this is the main function of the phone and its not working and i realize the its a common problem for HTC phone. waste of my time and money,2016年3月29日 在美国审核

Crap.,"First of all, I did not receive this phone with an android operating system as advertised. The one that I received was originally ATT and turned out to be a windows phone.Which I could have dealt with.But this is the first day I have had it, and NONE of the apps I have tried to download will run at all. The preinstalled apps run fine, but anything I download myself won't get past the login screen.I thought maybe the fact that it needed an update might be the cause, but I have tried to download it numerous times just to have it stop at 63% every time, and start over.From what I can tell, these are not quality products.

The company cant estimate how much it will cost and it will take weeks before they fix it for more than the phone is worth.

It sucks. After a year the battery starts to died ...,"I am updating my review of the HTC phone. It sucks. After a year the battery starts to died and won't charge properly. Thinking it was something with my charger, I brought a new one. It would charge for a few months then one day the screen on my phone goes black and I lost everything.Thinking that I just have bad luck, I brought the HTC 10. Less than 6 months the phone starts to repeat the same problems as my HTC 8 but with a shorter lifespan. I spent 2 weekends with HTC support trying to trouble shoot the issues, when that did not work they said I can put my card on hold and they will send me a new phone in a couple of days. Over a month later, still have not received a new replacement. HTC support gives me the same run around every week. All in all, don't buy an HTC phone. The battery sucks and if you don't back up your phone on a daily basis there is a chance of losing everything one day without notice. The company can't seem to address this issue and its not a user error when you have the phone using the original wall charger and it still doesn't charge. GO WITH ANOTHER BRAND. I hate Apple but I would rather have one of their devices then this crappy HTC right now.",2014年8月23日 在美国审核

"It's a great phone, was delivered earlier than I expected which ...","It's a great phone overall but I wouldn't recommend buying it and trying to use it on another network even though it says unlocked. I bought mine last year July, and recently had to reset it because I was having some trouble with earphone port.. I was listening to music and all of a sudden it stopped working. I thought that it was something with the system and so I reset it and it turns out it wasn't the system but now I had a new problem. When I first bought the phone the mobile data didn't work and it was missing the APN code but it worked fine after they manually entered it. When I recently reset it, the mobile data wasn't working again and I thought it might have been the same issue. And I contacted my network provider and visited stores twice but they all said that it must have still been locked on to AT&amp;T, which didn't make sense because it says it's unlocked and it was working fine before. And they said that it works fine at first but it eventually goes back once you reset the phone or something because it wasn't full unlocked, and they said that there isn't really anything to do besides to buy a new phone which I find quite amusing because I bought this less than a year ago and now the mobile data doesn't work making my internet access very limited and I also can't receive picture messages.",2015年7月31日 在美国审核

When my carrier APN info is added, the phone stops working altogether, service-wise. I was able to download an ap that allows me to call &amp; text over WiFi; although the recipient sees a different phone # though so that's annoying unless it's a friend who's aware of my cellular debacle.

I bought this phone because of the front speakers yet the top speaker is horrible it has the worst staticy sound no matter what,Screen is not set in the phone it is popped out on the top and right side that if you look at it from the side or top you see a sliver of light between phone and glass. Can't pop it back in place either. I bought this phone because of the front speakers yet the top speaker is horrible it has the worst staticy sound no matter what it plays even for the simplest thing such as a notification tone. If I cover the top speaker with my finger it sounds much better just by using the bottom speaker alone. Pretty disappointed about that. Would return it except it took almost a month to get here so I'm guessing it would take a month to send back and then another month for a different phone with probable problems to get here. I'd like it if it wasn't for that that's really a deal breaker for me though because I use it for Netflix at work and I can't use headphones at work so I have to listen to the horrible speaker.,2015年12月2日 在美国审核

I have normal sized hands and feel like I'm doing thumb yoga every app I use,Overall the phone works well and thanks to a recent android update the battery lasts alot longer. Nothing compared to my old moto G though.The phone is a little buggy. For example the driving app (application meant to make using apps while driving easier) always turns on for no apparent reason. I turned it off in the settings but it still decides to come back and haunt me with it's constant inconveniences. Right in the middle of a text or something it will switch to driving mode and then to exit I must go back to the main screen. In most cases I'll haveto exit driving mode 4 times before it lets me be and finish my text.Another gripe is that texting is not very accurate and laggy at times.Also the screen is a it large.

"Gorgeous to look at, but poor camera is a deal-breaker.","It is a beautiful piece of hardware, but I just don't understand why people think the Duo Camera is a good system.I think it is terrible. Most of the photos are completely blown out and there is such a crazy difference between the HDR and regular auto mode that it is like two completely different cameras were used. Plus the image quality is just plain fuzzy and lacks detail of other comparable phones. It's a real head-scratcher that the HTC developers chose this route.My Nexus 5 consistently delivers sharper, more true colors and better pictures across the board when I take the same picture using the same setting with both phones.I guess if I wanted to tinker with all the settings on the M8 camera, I would rather plop the $649.00 down on a nice DSLR. In a market where the camera isfast-becoming the deciding factor for consumers' choice of cell phones, this one is a really huge disappointment.And though the M8 is beautiful, the aluminum body has to be covered by a case to be used in everday life and that's a shame, because it ironically defeats the phone's stellar hardware design.My Nexus 5 has not had a case since I bought it in February, and it has survived several drops with aplomb. Plus, I just love its sleek minialmist design, and slim, lightweight profile. After loving my M7 and switching to the N5 until the M8 came out, I personally think my phone does not have to be a big statement piece; rather it needs to be functional, simple, elegant, fast, sturdy, and have the ability to take a really nice photo quickly and without a lot of fuss. I am constantly being complemented on the photos from my Nexus 5. Constantly! And at the half the price of other flagship phones; the Nexus is a keeper.",2014年4月18日 在美国审核

Soon I realized that there is no way to find the best position and take a pic of any histologic slide, after numerous attempts. After quizzing my students, I came up with the same conclusion: M8 is not the phone I can use. So, cam does not work for me the way I wished.Some reviews mentioned how easy to see the screen in sunlight.

iOS to Android,"About Me: I have been the Apple fanboy for the past few years. From the 3GS to iPhone 5S and Macbook and iPad geek. Never owned a flagship Android base phone. I am an average technology geek look for high end technology at low budget costs for good features.Impressions: Since the M7 to the M8 Leaks, I had fallen in love with the phone. The elegant and classy look just compelled my eyes. I knew I had to have this phone. The front speakers and overall appearance of the phone stole me. I went in blind to the Android world.The ""M8"": I have been using the phone for the past 5 days, and I have to say I absolutely love the phone. Everyday I learn something new about the phone and it surprises me. The fast processor loads programs in a flash then multitasking is amazing.The so called bad crappy is not of an issue to me since im not a big camera fanatic and it shouldnt be a big judgement on the phone. Personally, I find myself having so much fun with the camera from the 3D dimensions to the unfocusing and stickers.The front speakers are really amazing sounds like concert coming from the phone. The 5 inch 1080p display is amazing to watch videos and just gaze at your phone. The slim design makes comfortable in one hand. The catches other iOS users to analyze my phone consider actually buying it. Its great phone and I would recommend to everyone. Never worry about space with the extra MicroSD slot.Pros:-Sleek &amp; Elegant.-Front Speakers-Camera Effects(find your self becoming a photographer)-Face Recognition unlocking-4.4.2 Kit Kat-Motion Launch-MicroSD(Up 128GB)-Ultra Fast load times.- Control your TVCons:-UltraPixel Camera(sometime you can notice it, not a big concern)-Not waterproofPersonally to me no real cons.Good phone to transfer over to if your a iOS user.",2014年4月12日 在美国审核

ONE smartphone to keep (I know it's a cheesy title),"Before I begin this review, I have to say I enjoy smartphones and change phones every 4-6 months. For the past 4 and a half months I've been a Nexus 5 user, before that I had the Xperia Z1 and before that one I had the Samsung Galaxy S4, which means I will be able to judge according to what I've used in the past.I realized it'd be better if I left a summary of PROS &amp; CONS before the wall of text:+ Premium look and feel, not as big on hands and at least for me, not really slippery.+ Beautiful and clear screen, even at direct sunlight.+ Micro SD expansion slot.+ Incredible and loud dual front-facing speakers.+ Pretty good camera after you learn its tricks and amazing effects like U-Focus when using properly.+ Sense 6.0, the best Android skin IMO, not invasive and it actually improves the UI instead of making it a mess.+ Gestures. With the help of a launcher you can actually avoid using the power button at all.+ Amazing battery, holds up from 6am to 11pm having Mobile data on and listening to music for more than 6 hours a day.- Metal unibody will scratch easily.- Terrible button placement for one hand use, which again, is fixable through other apps (Double tapping to lock).- Unprecise responsiveness of earphones/headphones controls (Play/Pause, Next and Previous track).- Camera could have been much better. I mean, it's not bad but there's room for improvement.- Easy scratchable camera lense.Now, onto the review:FIRST IMPRESSIONS: I already knew what I was getting, I had read all the technical stuff and watched a couple of videos of the phone itself. But when I opened the box I was still blown away. The One M8 is such a great piece of smartphone, it's definetely a gorgeous phone because, as you probably read, it's made of 90% metal so it has that premium look and feel you'd expect from a flagship device.DESIGN: I honestly thought the HTC One M8 would be huge in my average size hands, but it actually was great to hold and the unibody gives it a great feel too or maybe my hands aren't as average as I believed! I was also concerned because I read from several places that due to its metal body it was pretty slippery; but I've had the phone for a week and not a single drop or slip so far. Although, I do have to say it is slippery when I have it on my pocket while sitting, it usually tends to slide out and I have to move it back once every while (Of course, this depends on how still you are or if you move your legs often). As much as I love the metal design, look and feel I think it's more of a curse than a blessing, because it scratches way too easily; this means you'll probably will have to buy a case if you don't want your phone to have the back side completely scratched, luckily there's a couple of case choices to avoid covering the beautiful back of it (I bought myself a translucid Spigen case).The one thing I think HTC got all wrong is the button placement, it's not logical or comfortable at all, but I will talk about it a little more in a while, along with the gestures system. But one point where HTC did great is on the memory expansion capabilities via MicroSD card, I listen to music most of the time and have around 40Gb of music on my phone at the moment, this was a big plus for me.SPEAKERS/AUDIO: Two of the many reasons I wanted this phone were the dual front facing speakers and in a couple of words: they don't dissappoint at all! They are simply the best I've had on a phone. Amazing loud and crystal clear sound speakers, there's no fuzziness or distortion at max volume here AND I can finally place my phone wherever without covering them. The only thing that kinda bugs me is the fact that they are not symmetrical, but I'll learn to live with it. In addition, I actually didn't expect earphones to be included, so I was a little surprised to see them. They're not bad, but I don't like the fact that the earbuds are red, so I will keep using my ATH-M50s and my Hammerheads pro.There's one thing I noticed and had issues with, the responsiveness of the handsfree button (Play/Pause, Next track and Previous track) with the default earphones and with my Hammerheads. It takes about one second after pressing it to take effect and sometimes the double tap action to skip to the next track is recognized as a triple tap, which takes me back to the previous track. Coming from the Nexus 5, where the responsiveness was immediate and precise, it will take some time to get used to.SOFTWARE, CAMERA AND BATTERY: I've always been a fan of Stock Android, which is why I loved my Nexus 5 and didn't quite enjoy the S4 and touch wiz; but I think it's safe to say I love Sense 6.0 as much or even more than Stock Android. It's not intrusive, it doesn't have drastic changes on the UI and it's simple enough to make it look great. I really liked the fact you can edit the quick settings shortcuts as you like and that they change colors according to the theme you choose, the same goes to the notification bar changing colors depending on the application you're using; I also enjoyed being able to change the font style of the whole phone with just a couple of taps. It's all about the little things.Talking about tapping the screen brings me to the next item: Gestures. This whole idea of double tapping and swiping the screen to unlock the phone made me remember my beloved Nokia N9, great concept. It also makes it a lot easier for the user to unlock the device without having to reach the awkwardly located power button. And since I'm a loyal Nova Launcher user I ended up configuring the double tap action to lock my phone, so now I have no need at all to reach the power button. The one thing I would have liked is that gestures wouldn't require a slight movement of the device to work properly because I tend to check my phone without moving it from my desk and now that requires me tapping the screen 4 times exactly to work without motion.The duo camera, as they call it, is pretty decent for what it is: A phone camera. You wouldn't replace your actual camera with it if you're into the matter; but if you're like me, a casual photographer, it'll do just fine. What I really liked was the U-Focus effect, I find myself using it quite often and after a while of playing with it you'll figure out what you need to do to make it work quite good. I say this because if you don't define well the foreground subject from the background or vice versa you'll end up with an unshareable picture. Overall, I have to say I'm quite impressed with the camera, but it's pretty obvious there are phones with better cameras on the market, I'd be lying if I said this was the best camera on a phone I've tried.On the battery side, most of my week (6/7 days) I get up at 6am and go to work, I have WiFi on throughout the day and Mobile Data when I'm commuting, answer mails and the occasional Social Networking usage (Facebook, Twitter, Line, Whatsapp and Instagram), but most importantly I can't live without music and because of that in my regular day I usually listen about 7-9 hours of music on my phone, . At the end of everyday, which is around 11pm for me, I have 20-30% left of battery; this is a bit more battery life I had at the end of the day than on my Nexus 5. To sum up: I can't complain about battery life at ALL.CONCLUSION: I'm very happy with the choice I made and I don't think I'll be changing phones for a good while; sure there are a couple of things I would change, but nothing drastic and nothing that'd be a deal breaker for me. Overall, it's an amazing phone and I would recommend it to most people.",2014年4月21日 在美国审核

"If you listen to podcasts, audiobooks or music often, you should get this phone","Chances are you know already that this is a beautiful and fast beast of a phone. What you may not realize is that the M8 has a high-quality headphone amplifier that should make it hard to ignore for any audiophile. With a nice pair of earphones I compared the audio output from this device to the Galaxy S5 and my own Galaxy S3. The difference was enormous. While the overall presentation emphasizes warmth over clarity too much for my taste, sounds from this device are amazingly clean and rich for a phone. The Samsung devices sound very bad by comparison. Look up the GSM Arena review of the M8 and you'll see that instrumented testing backs my opinion up. If you care about audio and you hear the difference, you won't be able to pass this up. It's in a class of its own in this regard.I must comment on the BoomSound speakers. Like you I knew all about them before my purchase. But what I didn't appreciate was how much they would enhance my lifestyle, which involves listening to podcasts and audiobooks throughout the day. I like to be constantly stimulated and learning. With the M8 I can have rich and full playback of anything I like wherever I go without carrying around a separate Bluetooth speaker that must be paired and charged. That is a huge convenience and pleasure. These speakers are so impressive.I realize the camera is subpar for this class of phone but it is more than adequate. I have always used a dedicated camera for any photos that are truly important anyway so this isn't a big problem even if it costs the phone some bragging rights. But how often do you take pictures and how often do you listen to music through the headset or play podcasts in the kitchen? If you use your phone's audio capabilities more than you use its camera, and I suspect that's the case for most of us, then you should give the M8 serious consideration. HTC spent their research and hardware dollars on great audio and the payoff is remarkable.",2014年5月25日 在美国审核
"At the time it was a great phone, before that I remember the phone to ...","iOS convert here! I had bought in to Apple's ecosystem early on, think I got the original iPhone a week or two after launch. At the time it was a great phone, before that I remember the phone to have as being the Sidekick 3 lol. I had the iPhone, 3G, skipped to the 4, then the 5. I was eagerly anticipating the 6 knowing it was GOING to be my next phone. Then...disappointment. I was unhappy with a few aspects. The lack of a 1080P screen on the 4.7"" form factor. Why not Apple? The unimpressive battery life...the unfounded rumor of a sapphire screen...the same old aesthetic and fairly restrictive iOS. I had experienced some early Android phones and came away VERY unimpressed, they were clunky, ugly GUIs, etc. Then I ended up getting a Nexus 7 because I wanted a nice, inexpensive tablet. I was very impressed with the strides Android had made. I thought to myself hmm, I could probably get used to an Android phone. I am what would be considered a power user, I use my device heavily throughout the day for media consumption, texting and e-mail, and sometimes as a camera replacement. I was going to wait until the Moto X was released but got an offer I couldn't ignore to purchase the HTC One M8. It was on the short list as it was, along with the Sony Xperia Z2/3 and the Moto X. I really like the HTC's construction, speaker/sound quality, and the 5"" screen. These are all immediate and measurable upgrades over my iPhone 5. The phone feels much snappier in general. I suppose the 4MP camera leaves a bit to be desired but it's still better than the iPhone 5's snapper, subjectively. There are many more options and advanced controls. This is also not my only camera, I own a DSLR with mucho megapixels should I need wall art sized blow-ups. I neither expect nor need my cell phone camera to give me such performance. The battery life is pretty good, I can get through a whole day (barely) but my 5 was crying uncle by about 4:30-5pm, whereas this guy can be plugged in as I'm putting myself in sleep mode. The screen is very nice. The colors AREN'T quite as good or vibrant as the LG G3 or the Galaxy S5. The phone feels worlds better in the hand though. The perceived quality is just so much better.IMO the only phone that's more pleasing is some of the custom configs that you can create with Motomaker for the Moto X. If there are any shortcomings, I would say that compared to iOS, Android still seems to have a bug or two more and hangs up/freezes from time to time. I've had to reboot my phone a few more times than I needed to my 5. The other thing is it's not water resistant or waterproof like the GS5 or Xperia Z3. All in all it's a very strong option for those of you who want a phone that does pretty much everything well with no major flaws and a beautiful design. Without a doubt it's the best phone I've ever owned.",2014年9月25日 在美国审核
Undeniably the Best Phone I've owned.,"The HTC M8 is a true work of art. I've been an HTC fan since the original Desire, and their phones have been very good. Still, there was always something lacking from each one. In my opinion, the one pure jewel HTC produced was the Evo 4G. It received updates, it had 4G, it had a beautiful display at the time, a great camera, a kickstand, just about everything you would want in a phone in 2010. It has been a while since HTC has created a phone as good as that one. The HTC One came close, but its battery was lackluster and its camera didn't produce the best shots.However, I picked up the M8 on the first day regardless. My phone set up before the M8 was a Droid DNA and iPhone 5S. I also recently picked up a Moto X and Nexus 5 for fun. With that said, as soon as I picked up the M8 out of the box, I was shocked by the amazing build quality. This is unmatched and goes beyond what the iPhone and the original One had. I like to call it a metal pillow because it feels so soft yet so sterile at the same time. Its rounded back and the smooth aluminum finish makes it feel like one of the most, if the not the most, premium phone on the market. With my first impression already being positive, I quickly put the box aside and turned the phone on. I was soon greeted a bright, vibrant 1080p display. This is arguably the best panel I've ever seen. The Droid DNA and HTC One M7 all had 1080p displays but it was not as bright and not as accurate. The iPhone 5S and Nexus 7 are regarded as very accurate displays and having both on hand, I compared them with the M8 and I have to say the M8 have the best out of them. The colors pop, but not as strong and artificial as the AMOLED screens yet the tones are more realistic than the Nexus 7. This is a great display.Moving on to using the phone, Sense 6 is a great improvement on the already good Sense 5. It retains the same features, but is a complete redesign with a flatter, modern UI. Every app is equipped with a vibrant palette of colors that extend to the notification bar, which looks fantastic on this beautiful screen. Every aspect is improved, Blinkfeed now includes more extensions and the home buttons are on screen for better comfort. The phone is faster, more feature packed than any previous iteration. Using apps are a joy, when there is no lag to be seen. Playing intense games like Modern Combat, Riptide 2, and Spiderman 2 show impressive details yet not dropping a single frame.There are also 2 very cool hardware features HTC put into the phone. That is the Duo Camera and the BoomSound speakers. BoomSound was present in the original One M7 which was widely praised by critics but this is even better. It's louder(25% according to HTC), clearer, and has an improved engine that spreads the sound further for a more immersive stereo feel. These are the only speakers on a phone that sound phenomenal, it is unmatched by small, tinny speakers on competitors(cough* Samsung). The Duo Camera was originally dismissed as a gimmick, but it is actually a very functional set of cameras. It allows for depth information that software simply can't do. It captures depth with every single image so you don't have to worry about turning on a feature or worrying about not taking a picture right. After taking the picture you can refocus, adjust how much blur you want, and pick any area on the picture instead of just front and back like other phones. The front camera also is the best on any phone with 5 MP and a selfie mode specifically made for taking self portraits.Overall, this is a fantastic, fantastic phone. It has everything you could want in a phone. It lasts a long time, I got 35 hours on one charge! I have it set to turn on battery saver at 20% which gives me an extra 2 hours or so and at 5%, HTC Extreme Battery Mode turns on and I get another 6 hours or so at 5% while retaining the ability to text, call, use email, and calculator. Knowing all this, there is no reason not to get this phone. Great design, great display, fast, smart, great speakers, great battery, it's a damn near perfect phone.",2014年7月3日 在美国审核
The ONE to RULE THEM ALL,"Best phone I ever owned..This is coming from a Note 3 user..I had the last years M7 but I sold it cause I needed at SD card. Now HTC has done the right thing and I went back to HTC..Completely destroys any Samsung phone..OK it has only 4 megapixel but it still shoot very good pictures..The Sense skin is flawless, almost stock and IMO it blows Stock Android away..WHY? because not only do you get the pure stock look, you get some amazing features that HTC puts in that its missing from Nexus Stock or AOSP.. Better camera app..The camera app is so spectacular..this is what sold me to it..I control the shot with its manual control which even the Note 3 or GS5 doesn't come with. The Boom sound speakers destroys anything on the market today. The build quality puts everything else to shame..even feels and looks better than iPhones 5/5S. YOu got alot a TV remote app which uses the IR in the phone to control your TV and see all TV listing on Direct TV,DISH, Comcast and U-Verse. The call quality is second to none..It sounds so clear, and with the dual FF speakers you can put the phone on Speaker call and it comes out from the 2 FF speakers. The performance is buttery smooth.

A Solid Phone!,"The HTC One M8 is a fantastic device and right off the bat I will say that if you are considering buying one, definitely jump on the opportunity to do so. Compared to the other flagship android phones in terms of specs, value, and overall user experience, the HTC One M8 holds it own fairly easily. The solid Snapdragon 801 processor moves things along very nicely and the extra 2GB Ram definitely helps with that. I have had no issues of general lag and HTC Sense runs very smoothly. The overall feel of the phone is great and when you pick up the phone it just feels like a quality device. In terms of software and features, all the features that come standard with the device just make sense and don't raise any question as to why they would be there. The front facing speakers sound amazing, the micro sd card expansion capability is of course great, and the camera is decent for taking good photos. With that being said, the camera could be improved because aside from taking photos for fun, this camera really cannot be used for any sort of editing purposes due to the 4mp images with the ""ultra-pixel"" technology because the images will get very blurry and distorted when zoomed in. Putting that aside, HTC's skin on android is very easy to use and if your someone like me who likes using stock android, you will be happy using HTC Sense because of how light of an overlay it is and it is definitely not as heavy as something like samsung's touchwiz. However within a few days of having the phone, I did install Nova Launcher just because it provides a more pure feeling android experience. If you don't want to use a launcher and want to use stock android, then just pick up a google play edition of the phone if they are still available. In terms of hardware, If you are coming from the iPhone 5, or any other model iPhone really, then you are definitely accustomed to quality hardware and components and this is an area where, in my opinion, some android phones lack in. However, this is not one of them. The phone is basically all metal, not entirely, but almost, so it feels great, however it does introduce some level of sacrifice, being a non-removable back of the phone which means no removal battery. But if your coming from the iPhone then you are already used to that and I can safely say that so far with my experience with the phone, this phones battery outlasts the iPhones battery especially once I upgraded to iOS 7. Also, this phone features an extreme battery saving mode which basically turns the phone into a high tech nokia phone that is limited to phone calls and texts for the most part at least. Continuing with hardware, my biggest complaint about the phone is the positioning of the power button. The way it sits on the top of the phone, being that this is a relatively tall phone, makes for a somewhat awkward reach that almost forces you to slide your hand up to the top of the phone. Also I find myself pressing the volume up button a lot of the time when I go to hit the power button. However aside from that, I really have no other complaints. If you are considering this phone against the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the LG G3, I would seriously consider this phone because it is simply just a solid build device with no gimmicky features and fantastic performance.",2014年7月13日 在美国审核
An extremely reliable and stunning device that brings every user something to the table,"In a world filled with iPhones and Galaxy S devices, a new product strikes the market that could be a game changer. The HTC One M8 (or the M8, as I will call it in this review) is one of the best phones of the year, so far, and still continues to stun me. It is an extremely reliable and stunning device that brings every user something to the table. Throughout the years, I’ve owned smartphone after smartphone. I placed my trust in my Samsung Galaxy devices, only to have extremely flimsy and faulty operating systems. I lost all hope in the sphere of Galaxy devices, so I decided to try out a new phone from HTC. I never expected to have such luck as I have had. The phone is made out of metal to ensure less damage to the phone, rather than having a plastic body. I have dropped it a few times and there hasn’t been a problem since those mishaps. As far as display and interface go, the M8 could not be improved any more. Its 5” screen make watching videos and TV a joy; not to mention the audio quality of the phone is overwhelmingly up-to-par.Finally, for all those who love taking pictures: don’t fret! The rear-facing cameras (yes, there are two) have “ultrapixel” resolution, which take outstanding photos. The front-facing camera, which has 5 Megapixel resolution, is perfect for taking the occasional selfie. Where there are successes, there are also faults. As a common user of the M8, I cannot say that I have used the cell phone to its full potential. There are a lot of hidden gems within the phone that I have not harnessed yet. The back of the phone, too, cannot be removed, which can be a bit of a hassle if the battery needs to be changed. These are minor details if you take care of your cell phone and take time to figure out what the phone is capable of. All in all, the M8 is the best phone I have ever had, in terms of reliability and interface. I recommend this cell phone to anyone.",2014年9月15日 在美国审核
One of the best phones of 2014,"This is one of the best android phones of 2014, it is right up there with the iphone 5s, Samsung GS5 and the Sony Z2. The most noticeable thing about this phone is its superior build quality, gone are the days of plastic backs and flimsy design as this phone is all metal and exudes luxury. This phone is the iphone of the android ecosystem.The screen on this phone is one of the best that I have used to date, it has a 5' display with a crystal clear picture, true colors and not once have I come across an issue regarding screen brightness.The front facing HTC boom sound speakers are the best speakers put on a phone, EVER. The sound quality and loudness are astonishing, they easily beat the loudness of my ipad and at times drown out the sound of my TV set. In short, smartphone audio has never sounded better....or louder.The phones internals(CPU and Ram) are near identical to the other two industry leading smartphones on the market right now(GS5 and Z2). The phone is lightning quick and easily handles anything you throw its way, android OS has never been faster or more responsive.The Sense 6 user interface is one of the cleanest and most intuitive android skins to date and is only rivaled by stock android which is only available on nexus and google play edition devices. The Sense 6 UI easily puts to shame Samsung’s TouchWiz UI and Sony’s Xperia UI. This is how an android skin should be, true to its android roots with a few minor tweaks to capitalize on the hardware. The only minor complaint I have regarding the UI is the fact that you have to scroll up/down when you want to navigate the app tray as opposed to side to side.The phones battery stamina is what I expected it to be, it will get you through a whole day with light to moderate use and you will be charging this phone every night. The Sense UI does include two power saving modes(PSM), standard and extreme. The standard PSM throttles the phones processing power along with a few other of its internals in order to extend the phones battery life throughout the day and the phone works as usual. The extreme PSM is a little different, when activated its essentially turns your phone into a dumbphone getting rid of most of the phones capabilities and giving you access only to the phone and text messaging capabilities of the phone along with the ability to check your email inbox yourself(no auto updates); This mode will extend the battery life a significant amount(HTC promises 14 days of life on a single charge or 15 hrs from 5 % battery while on this mode). You can set extreme PSM to activate automatically when your phones battery hits a certain percentage and, just like that, gone are the days of “Hey, do you have a charger? My phones about to die.”.Now, for the disappointing part of the phone, the camera. I am not saying that the camera on this phone is bad, but it’s not great either. The phone is equipped with a 4 UltraPixel camera(Who are we kidding, it’s a 4 megapixel camera with a fancy name, nice try marketing department) along with a second lens/depth sensor. I will focus on the main camera as I find the depth sensor lens to be quiet gimmicky and of no significant use. The camera takes decent photos that are more than good enough to take pictures that are meant for facebook and for day to day use. The images from a non-zoomed perspective look good, but when you zoom in, the photo suffers as the pixilation becomes evident. If you are looking for a camera to take photos which you will frame, look elsewhere. It really is a shame that the depth sensortook precedence over upgrading the main lens(even an upgrade to 6 MP would have done the job) as that is the only thing keeping the phone from being called “the best phone of 2014, period”. The front facing camera is a 5MP sensor (Yes, the front facing camera has more pixels than the main one) and works just as expected, good enough forvideo chats and selfies.A few things worth mentioning, the phone does gets a little warm over prolonged use(this is standard will all the new snapdragon 801 processors), but it doesn't get uncomfortable, and that the phone is a little larger than other phones in its class as a result of the two boom sound speakers.In conclusion, This phone is a delight to use, a safe bet and is definitely “one of the best phones of 2014”.",2014年4月21日 在美国审核

Language Opiton issue.,"Hi, I just got this phone delivered couple days back.First, it came in with the wrong color. I ordered Gunmetal Grey, but it came as Silver. Which I don't really mind. But here is something that's not working for me on this phone right now.When I go into the Language&amp;Keyboard section, under Language, it only shows English and Spanish as the options.I tried reset the phone,but it didn't help.I got this phone for my dad, he only reads Mandarin. And i made sure this phone (HTC ONE M8) does come with all kinds of display language options before I purchase it. So I don't understand why this phone I just got only has two language options.",2014年5月20日 在美国审核
Basics M8 review &amp; Why the M8 this better than iPhones,"Okay, so this is going to be a bit of a long-ish pre-talk and a review, but I think it is important to narrow down the specifics about this phone because there's a lot to be said.I have been dealing with cell phones since pretty much high school. (90's). During this time I have had an opportunity to own about 150 to 200 cell phones, swapping them sometimes weekly. ( same phones but different colors, phones with different capacity etc are in the equation)I have gone through brands not well known in the United States back then, including Nokia, Alcatel, LG, Samsung flip phones and so on.When I've moved to United States, I actually used an HTC Desire device. I had the HTC Legend, HTC Desire, and HTC Desire Z phones. HTC Legend was probably the one most similar to the HTC One M8 in terms of feel and unibody/steel quality. Although the original Desire is still to this day considered to be legendary in the phone modding community. Anyway, since my move, I have converted to iPhones, selling all of my HTC devices. I have tried the Samsung Galaxy s3, s4 and s5 when I was getting bored of iOS, but I always ended up going back to iPhones. After all, they have a premium build feel and come with a simple UI to use. Knowing that the new iPhone 6 is coming out in pretty much a few days, I have sold my year old 5s (the value of the 5s will depreciate very fast after iPhone 6 is introduced). I owned an iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s throughout 3 years, swapping them out for Samsung Galaxy devices as mentioned before. Long story short, after I have done my research with an intention to buy a new phone replacing my 5s, I have narrowed down my search to the 3 main competitors at this moment. The LG g3, Samsung Galaxy S5, and the HTC One m8. (Xperia Z3 is still not out at the time of this review).I have purchased the Galaxy s5 off hand and was immediately put down by the plastic build quality. I just couldn't believe that since version 3, pretty much nothing has changed. It also felt too wide. I have sold this device after a week of having it. Now, before I have purchased the M8 I had a few deals made where I would swap my 5s for the LG G3, but these deals never went through. The phone felt great in hand but as I only got to spend a few minutes with the LG G3, so I can't say too much in comparison to the M8. Maybe someone else can.I ended up calling T-Mobile customer service when I saw a special deal online and ended up ordering the M8 with a few additional discounts provided by the awesome TM representative (Yes, I realize I probably got lucky). So here is the actual review:1. Feel and quality2. Size and one handed use3. Signal and phone call quality4. UI and bloatware5. Camera6. Battery life7. Is it worth?8. PS'sI have had the same feeling looking at and holding this device compared to when I was holding my iPhone 5s or MacBook Air for the first time. It's a really beautiful piece of device. You really get to appreciate and feel the amazing QUALITY of this phone. You know you have paid extra, but for something that is really worth the asking price.It's just something you need to experience. Yes, you will probably put a case on this device, but you still know what you are holding in hand.The SIZE is ok. I don't have small hands but the device feels just a tad too big. I think the 4.7 or a 4.9 screen body would be a little bit better (that's what the M7 is) but that's just a minor problem, because the screen of course compensates for all that with its beautiful reproduction of displayed images. If you are considering this phone, be prepared to use both hands at some point. I tend to use two hands while dragging the notification bar down from the top of the phone. Other than that you might not need to, as the double tap functionality turns on and off the display, so you don't really need to use the power button a whole lot either. I am also sure that HTC will improve on hand gestures in the near future, based on responses from us, consumers. They are pretty good with that.One of the very strong aspects of this phone is the SIGNAL strengtht. I used to place calls while doing laundry with my iPhone 5s, and when I would go to the basement and forget about where I am, I would have dropped calls because of the lost signal. Where I used to have 0 bars with my iphone 5s, I now have 2 bars with HTC One m8. That means that I can continue conversations and make calls in places where I would not be able to with my iphone 5s. Of course I am talking about same provider and same environment. That shows that the antenna of this phone is pretty high quality. And if you ask me, that'sdefinitely the most important thing on the phone, isn't it? Placing and receiving calls?! Not to go to extremes, but it might just save you from trouble one day, or even save your life.While I am at the CALL QUALITY,I would also like to note that the sound through the phone sounds crystal clear. Land line quality. I have received just one complain from the other side of the line, but it was definitely due to my case I have on this phone as it covers a big chunk of the bottom of the phone and I was on the loud speaker.Speaking of which, the inner speaker (not the hands free one) is placed a bit to the left of the speaker bar area, so you will need to readjust the phone and get used to it while holding it to your ear. If you place the middle of the upper speaker to your ear just like with most of the other phones, you will not be at the call speaker opening.HTC SENSE 6 in my humble opinion, is the best you can get without having stock Android. The UI is very light, very snappy, not all in white which I love, because it preserves battery life and is easier on the eyes. I consider this to be one of the major downsides of iOS and other UIs. You can of course always install any other launcher from the Play Store, but stock HTC UI is a very pleasant and satisfying one in the first place. And if you really really want a change, you can always install a custom ROM (CM11 for example) on this phone and end up with a Nexus 5 kind of pure experience, but in a super premium aluminum body. Also, I am not sure if this is due to the UI of the pone or the display itself, but the lowest brightness setting on this device is a bit too bright in pitch black dark environment (understand in bed at night). Hopefully this will be fixed.There was so much said and so many videos posted about the CAMERA of this phone already. Yes, it is very hard to get close to the superior cameras that iPhones provide, but let's be honest: Almost everybody who takes pictures on their phone is either posting them on Facebook, Instagram or something similar, where there is no high pixel density needed. So for an every day modern user who does that or send pictures through MMS every now and then, this phone is more than satisfactory. No it will not have the iPhone quality but it will be really really close to it. You can absolutely take pictures with this phone that can be framed in a 4 x 6 frame let's say. It's absolutely enough for that. If you want more, you will need a camera shooter, no matter what device you own. And then you have some very cool effects that no other or all phones have, due to two cameras or this device being an HTC. (3d mode, HTC 360 mode, dual front and back camera recording at the same time). If you are worried about the camera of the phone and it is the only concern you have, bite it. Trust me, it is enough.BATTERY LIFE of this device is great. It definitely outperforms the iPhones, so I can easily get from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on a single charge. That was absolutely not the case with the iPhone, as I needed to charge at least once a day to get me through a 9-5 work day, with the way I use the phone. Everybody who has an iPhone has this ""charging syndrome"" with charging cables in the car office and at home. That's not the case with this phone which is a huge benefit. I considered the need to charge my iPhone regularly as mentally draining. I'll gladly give up thinking about ""Oh, I need to be able to charge my damn phone soon."" experience. Looking back it's frustrating. Very frustrating! But not with this phone and that's how it should be.So is it WORTH? Overall, this is an absolutely fantastic device. I can proudly say that I am an HTC owner and I gladly support this company. It also came to me full circle on the day that I have purchased this device and finally got to open it, that the 4 HTC devices were the only ones throughout my 20 years of dealing with phones, that I got brand new in a box from a retail unit.And no, I am NOT affiliated with HTC in any way. I am just a fan of this phone, just as much as I am a fan of my beautiful MacBook Air. I think that quality and a good product is quality and a good product. It's as simple as that. And in this world today, we need to be able to differentiate and praise the good from the rest.Fortunately, this review is for that good product.PS1: this device comes with 32 gigabytes of internal storage by default. You can also get a 64 gigabyte Micro SD card for under $40 nowadays. So considering that you can be walking around with almost 100GB of internal storage in your pocket, is just crazy. I know that this phone is not the only one that offers this, but it does! And compared to my 16GBiPhone 5s that I sold just for $30 less USED than getting this brand new, come on?!:-).PS2: T-Mobile and HTC try to keep this as quiet as possible (on purpose), but HTC will replace your shattered screen within the first 6 months of ownership free of charge.Read included paperwork. While it's impossible to touch Amazon's world leading customer service quality level (my opinion) and Apple is probably the closest to that a with their 1 to 1 swap hardware warranty on their new released products, HTC comes in third with this offer for me.I hope this helped at least a little.Have a great day and should you purchase this device, please share your excitement with us.Update: I have sold this phone as I could not get passed a few things. The radio bug is the most annoying one if all. Please use the search engines to find out what it is but it's a big deal!The battery life was great but no as great as I thought initially. And the value goes down really fast. Lastly, and this is just my personal preference, the phone was just a tiny bit too big to reach diagonally from corner to corner in the screen. The HTC m9 is coming out in 3 months, and so there is no reason to buy this phone for this kind of money. I have purchased a BlackBerry Z30 and it beats this phone in pretty much every aspect. Even the sound! I know and trust me, Z30 beats the sound quality. M8 although remains the second best sounding phone ever made, the problem is that the Z30 costs 50% less, literally! And I am sad to announce that I don't miss my m8 :(",2014年8月29日 在美国审核
"The Undisputed best phone in the world.  Stop researching there's nothing close, get this phone","I've been through them all folks, and I don't just use a cell phone the typical way.Yes I use it to communicate, text, surf the web, check ,y email, and dabble with apps, but I master these phones.There is not a capability or a possibility these machines possess that I do not exploit to the fullest.I started with blackberry went to droid, then windows, IPhones for years, and just as I was about to get an iPhone 6 I read an article about this phone.I read it on my old iPhone on the way to what was a sure iPhone upgrade.The article and five minutes of tinkering changed my mind and while I enjoy my iPad for entertainment, the HTC One M8 is. The most serious piece of hardware I've ever owned.It was always said if you want complex possibilities with major issues and constant freezing droid is your deal, if you want smooth easy and simple then go apple. This phone runs smoother than any phone, tablet I've ever owned.It's beyond complex, this phone is not only powerful, learn to use it and you'll find yourself equipped to deal with almost anything.One fun example is walking into a friend or families house and having total control over their entertainment centers in seconds.I remotely access my computer and others.I can receive calls and texts on the computer and files will transfer to the computer without any cloud or Bluetooth , although you have that as well.Right now at this moment when this phone is a year old, and still on android kitkat awaiting the lollipop upgrade it is still undeniably the best phone in the world.It's better than anything from Apple, and windows, it's far better than the S5, and I smile now remembering the Verizon worker trying to talk me into waiting a week for the Note 4 which while imoressive in a more superficial way, has nothing, nothing at all on the HTC M8 One.I have the mini+ add on coming and this phone a year in has not reached potential as in the next 2 months lollipop will improve it even more.Don't shop around and waste time.Get the best phone in the world and throw yourself into truly learning to use it.",2014年11月30日 在美国审核
HTC have just done another impossible! The best is now much better,"One would think that there is nothing much to improve upon the HTC One (M7) as it was sleek, powerful and excellence and HTC One M8 would just be an incremental upgrade that give you only a minimum performance boost or some gimmick features like some other manufacturer out there which does not worth upgrading at all.HTC have proven everyone wrong, the HTC One M8 have a few key improvement and innovations, which make it another revolutionary device in the mobile industry. After upgrading from an HTC One (M7) to an HTC One M8 on 5 April 14, both myself and my girlfriend is still amazed with the improvement HTC brought to the M8, and I must share it with you:1. Duo Camera - While people are skeptical and some reviews are constantly claiming the low megapixel count will means low quality pictures. This is not true, the optic performance of the ultra-pixel camera along with the supporting lens is superb. The added depth information allow the pictures to have better color reproduction, the ability to refocus the shots after taking is just something that was only available in DSLR previously.2. Amazing Battery Life - The average battery life of my HTC One M7 was 18-20 hrs with about 3 hrs of screen on time, which is pretty amazing, my daily data usage is about 150-200MB on 4G network all time. With the same usage pattern I now get an average of 24hrs with 5-6hrs of screen on time. Some friends are getting two full days of usage isn't that amazing?3. The new BlinkFeed - Okay blinkfeed was available in the HTC One M7, but HTC have redesign it and it is now become better. A lot of people are thinking BlinkFeed is flipboard, my answer is that is totally wrong, blinkfeed work very differently, it is more intelligent and more seemless in usage. Basically once you have set up the information source that you are interested in, blinkfeed will create a profile and make the information available in a screen and it get updated as per the schedule.There are many more great features that I am still exploring after 2 month of using it. If you are out in the market looking for a new phone, this phone although is a little pricey is actually a bargain because of it quality and functionality. So get yours now!",2014年6月3日 在美国审核
My all time favorite phone,"I'm a heavy user of phones and usually Root them and go deep into the hardware.I tried the LG G3 and the Samsung S5.The S5 was the winner for the beautiful screen but the HTC One M8 did everything better than both the G3 and the S5.I like that the M8 is Root friendly, running KitKat 4.4.4 (5.0 any day now), great form factor in my hand, looks great, and with a Harmon Kardon ""tweak"", you can activate the Harmon Kardon module to improve the already great sound.I didn't care for the slightly washed out screen of the G3, I never could adjust it to my liking.I also had a little trouble with GPS reception on the G3.The sound on the S5 was yuck, I need good quality sound, that was a show stopper.The screen on the M8 is only slightly behind the S5 but blows away both of the other two phones in all categories in my opinion.I am also happy to be able to use my 128gb microSD card in the 32Gb M8 :) :)Overall, the more I use the M8, the more I like it.I was satisfied with a Samsung Galaxy S4 before this phone but this M8 is in another league better and now I could never go back.WELL DONE HTC!!!Thanks for being Root friendly too.",2014年12月9日 在美国审核
Died 3 months after warranty ended; screens with advertising jump in your face. DO NOT BUY!,"As the title states:I bought this phone in November of 2014.It died on me last week, the middle of February 2016.That means I had the phone in service for 15 months.The 12 month warranty ended three months ago.A week ago, I got a boot screen, with the word ""LOCKED"" at the top.I tried all the options on the boot screen over and over, none worked.I took it to a phone repair shop.They accused me of opening the phone and wrecking things inside (the phone won't open; I've actually been very gentle with it, and I'd never try to open it.)I sent it to the HTC Factory Repair shop. They quoted me a price of $290 for a main board repair.Excuse me, but a $500 dollar phone that dies three months after the warranty runs out is NOT worth sinking an additional $290 into.While the phone was working, I liked most of it's features.It's a good size for me, the speakers sound pretty good, and it did what I wanted it to do, most of the time.The camera is OK, but nothing special.One BIG BIG problem- HTC has some page that likes to jump in front of everything else, with advertising on it.It's supposedly giving me ""hints"" about establishments nearby that I may want to spend money at.If my screen gestures are any bit the least precise, the screen immediately jumps in front and stays there 'till I push it away.You know when your computer screen goes away and some obnoxious ad jumps in front of whatever you're looking at?And stays there 'till you get rid of it?This is what's happening with my HTC One M8.So here's what my $500 bought me: I thought I was getting a ""Flagship"" phone.In reality, I got an acceptble phone that died three months after the warranty ran out.Then they wanted $290 more to fix it.Who knows what problems I'd have in the future after I paid that kind of money?I also got a phone that pushes advertising to the front of my screen whenever I'm trying to do something.I paid good money for this phone; I'm paying good money for the service to run it.There's absolutely no reason why I should have to put up with this obnoxious ad page.Put both of these together, and there's only one conclusion to make: DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!",2016年2月19日 在美国审核
Worst phone I've ever had!,"Like pocket dialing?This is the phone for you!It's slick gunmetal grey case makes it slippery, unlike the DNA (Great phone - lasted over 2.5 years) I first bought from HTC and got this disaster as a replacement.So many ways this phone wants to be on ALL THE TIME.The power button is on the side and sticks out, so when you hold it to put it in your pocket - it turns on.No problem I can be clever and hold it front to back - NOPE - if you touch the screen by swiping up, or just 'tapping' it - it turns on again.And holding it delicately is difficult because it is so slippery.No matter how you hold this phone it wants to turn on - which is perfect if you want to delete that important email you haven't read yet, or lose a contact because it's on in your pocket.And that's just the design misstep.The tech problems have been ongoing since I received it.I can't get my contacts saved to the cloud, or consistently have the ability to go online without WIFI.These issues have been going on for months, and the techs at Verizon have told me - finally - that it's not a network, but a hardware issue.What a turkey of a phone.I will have to go thru my contacts and find the most recent added to this phone to MANUALLY add them to my cloud contacts so I can transfer them to another phone.HTC has pushed me to the dark side.I am ready to drink the cool-aid and pony up the money for an iPhone.Thanks HTC.",2016年4月17日 在美国审核
Love this phone,"I've had this phone for almost a year now (didn't order through Amazon) - and I absolutely love it still. This is going to be a lengthy review but it's only the tip of the iceberg. I apologize in advance for rambling. I'm a twenty-something female that uses my phone for basically everything. Documents, music, Netflix, pictures, phone calls and texts, etc.Storage: I have the 32gb internal version and also have a memory card, so there is plenty of space and storage available. I have at least 3000 music files, over 4000 photos and significant amount of videos, mild-moderate amount of apps and am sitting comfortably at about 17gb taken. The phone gives you the option to easily delete files to free up space if you want. I use this quite frequently. The SD card slot is located on the upper right side of the phone above the volume button. The card is not easily accessible. There's a tiny hole that you need to stick something in to get access to the card. I've only ever wanted to get it out once to print pictures, but wasn't able to with the end of a paper clip. I know they can open it easily at retailers, not sure if there's something they sell though.Camera quality: the front and rear facing cameras are both of fantastic quality. I know the s5 (main competitor for this phone) has a higher pixel count, but I've honestly never been a fan of Samsung devices and haven't noticed any difference in the picture quality at all between the two.OS: I don't know the specs as far as processor and Android version - all I know is that it's fully up to date with the newest version as of about a week ago. The update was fairly quick - about fifteen minutes.The screen is perfectly responsive without being too touchy.This is a noticeably powerful phone..I'm really quick with my fingers as I'm sure most cell phone users are nowadays, and this phone NEVER lags or hesitates for me.I've never ever had issues with this phone force closing or acting up in any way.I really like the fact that you can change the theme of your texts. There's a few different options to choose from. I used to always use an app for messaging that I could personalize but it stopped working with an update. I've found the phones texting to be attractive and user friendly so don't mind using it at all.Device: the phone is comfortable in the hands and the controls are conveniently located on the top right corner (power button) and upper right side for the volume. The volume rocker is completely smooth and doesn't have a divider, if you will, between up and down. The majority of the cases you can buy for it are designed with the divider, if that's something that's important to you.If there isn't a case on the phone, it can get a little slippery if your hands are dry or you don't have a good grip on it. I've found it to be very durable as it has survived many drops with and without a case on with no damage.It's a little 'heavy' compared to some other smart phones - I like a little weight to my devices, so for me its perfect.The two speakers in front are great. I do have a Bluetooth speaker I use most of the time for music and Netflix, but when I'm not using that, the phone speakers are impressive on their own. I have no complaints about in-call quality. It's clear and I have no issues hearing when in-call volume is about halfway. Its kind of quiet on speakerphone - but I don't use this often so not a deal breaker.The screen is crystal-clear.Does not appear pixilated at all.I haven't had issues as far as the light outside with this phone. I always keep the auto-adjust on for the brightness and everything is always visible.There's not much of a glare on the screen when it's in the sun.All in all, my only complaint about the phone is that the SD card isn't easily accessible. On a scale of importance from 1 to 10, that's about a 1.5.Like I said, I'm not a fan of Samsung. I was interested in finally getting one of the best android phones on the market so I went with this, and I'm soo glad I did.",2015年2月17日 在美国审核
The Reviews Are Right!

Don’t buy. Terrible battery problems. Network signal problems. Nice camera and menus.,"I purchased an HTC One M8 direct from the Sprint store. Immediately, the phone had issues connecting to the Sprint network. The phone would state that it had full signal but when I attempted to place a call, it would immediately switch to a No Signal icon and state that the call failed due to an “Immediate Signal Loss”. This went on for nearly 6 months with over fifteen visits to the Sprint Repair Center.Eventually the common occurrence of severe screen cracking occurred due to a corner impact. Thankfully the device was insured and replaced after a one-hundred-dollar non-refundable deductible (I would call it a fee) by Sprint. The replacement worked wonderfully for calls, internet and texts. I finally got to enjoy my $650 purchase (plus $100 Sprint warrantee fee). Little did I know this would not be the end of my woes.Wanting to get the maximum battery life out of the phone, I enabled “Power Saving” and set the phone to go into “Extreme Power Saving” mode when the battery reached 15% (the maximum value of the drop-down menu). Within a month, I was regularly finding my phone off in my pocket throughout the day. When turned back on, it would state that it was at 50% battery. Thinking I was pressing the power button in my daily activities, I purchased a protective case which also made it nigh impossible to accidentally press any of the buttons. This did not solve the issue of random power downs of the phone. My first realization of the true problem occurred near the 11th month after purchase, where I attempted to take a picture with the phone at 60% battery. The phone appeared to take the picture and the “Saving…” notification appeared on the screen. Abruptly the phone emitted a two-tone sound and shut down. Powering up the phone showed that a zero-byte file had been made for the picture and that the battery gauge stated the phone was at 72%. Within two minutes of powering the phone back up, it again emitted the two-tone sound, I now know intimately as the dead battery tone, and shut down again.Thinking that the problem must be similar to a computer battery gauge becoming confused, I attempted to find the procedure to “reset the battery gauge”. Turns out the programmers and hardware designers never implemented this feature. Fast forward to today (08-30-2018 = less than two years from purchase date), I had just took my phone off the HTC branded battery charger and went to take a picture of a lovely sun rise. My &lt;sarcasm&gt; wonderful &lt;/sarcasm&gt; phone decided that with a battery gauge of 100%, it was going to die from a dead battery.This being my first HTC product and only experience with the company, I can honestly say that I will never purchase any of their products ever again and will vehemently steer any person who asks about HTC as a brand to any other product. I have reached the point that I would recommend DirectTV and Comcast (two of the most hated companies throughout the United States) before I would recommend an HTC product. While the product has good looks and a slick interface, you would be better off with a flip phone for usability, as at least then you would have a product that could connect to your network and last the entire day on a single battery charge.TL;DR: Don’t buy. Terrible battery problems. Network signal problems. Nice camera and menus, but bring an external battery if using.",2018年8月30日 在美国审核
My honest review on my 2nd HTC One (previous M8),"Skip to the bottom for the phone review but here's my back story ..I started with a flip LG phone in 05. Made my way to hough the Alias, Palm Treo and 500wx, to the early touch Samsung phones of 2010, to a Droid by Motorola, to a blackberry curve, bold, and finally after I hated my touch screen blackberry I returned it, got a temporary htc Incredible 2 and researched the hellout of smartphones in Q3 2011 and ended up getting my rezound. My original resound was flawless but after I called it in the refurbs where a nightmare. I was able to get a Samsung Galaxy S3 early on the upgrade side and liked it a lot. It got old fast and I purchased me the Note 3 in November 13. I then did some wheeling and dealing and bought the HTC one M8 in April last year. Loved the phone hated the finger prints and also the size was odd for me back then. Boom sound was great and recording was awesome. The camera was just fine for a phone but didn't replace a good camera for sure. But guys we never ever are going to print these days pictures. We have so many anyway we will never even look at again. Be realistic lol. Stop caring about useless things. They looked amazing there and in this new device as well. I also am coming from a note 4 which had a good camera 75 percent of the time. Size also gets old fast.This new M9 is genuinely more polished and and although I usually run a super customized and awesome Nova launcher set up (with gestures to open apps in prime version).. This one is really nice just stock. I like the sound on the speakers especially when playing back recording. Picks up and really let's put those little sound details. It's a great handset for the long run and the battery life, themes and all are a breeze. I recommend you put swift key on your device and also Nova launcher. You can choose any icon set up even another make like Samsung. But who the hell would want touch wiz icons lol. I prefer this over the look and feel of the samsun Galaxy S devices. HTC has and always will have great phones. I wished they made more black hard rubberized devices like the rezound. But squared and styled. HTC has decision down for sure. Choose Android!",2015年4月11日 在美国审核
Best Phone I have ever owned,"I recently got an upgrade with Verizon, I hated my Iphone with a passion. So I switched over to an HTC, I have no regret! Everything about this phone is great! on top of that it looks professional.Battery Life:I recently had an iPhone, the battery life was absolutely horrid. I couldn't make it pasted one in the afternoon without needed a charge. But now I can make it through about a day, day and a half! HUGE improvement. It also has a Lithium battery which has a high charge density which means a longer life.Camera:Are you a phone-photographer? Well if you buy this phone you are sure to become one! the HTC One M8 has not one, but two rear cameras. HTC calls it a Duo camera. The main lens sports a 4 megapixel (1520 × 2688) UltraPixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and a pixel size of 2.0 micrometers. The secondary lens is there for just gathering information about depth. And instead on focusing on just the megapixel count and more on the size and quality of the pixels.BoomSound:I constantly listen to Sound Cloud, Pandora, and 8tracks. So when I heard that the HTC one M8 had built in amps I was ecstatic. Plus the M8 is 25 percent louder than before. The volume level easily beat the iPhone 5S, Galaxy S4 or Lumia 1020. The HTC One M8 has one massive .85cc top speaker chamber and .80cc bottom speaker chamber size. It's great for watching movies and YouTube.Size:Yes it is a Phablet (phone tablet) which means it has a bigger type of screen, Its about two times the size of my old iPhone 4s. I like it because its clear, handy, and the graphics are really nice. It is a 5inch screen along with a 441 ppi pixel density. The good thing about this phone is that its slightly big but not to big and its pixels are pretty amazing. Also includes a muilti touch sensitivity.Portability (size / weight):Has a good amount of weight to it that I really enjoy. It's kind of a larger phone but I really like it. Its not excessively heavy either. I haven't yet noticed a weight change since my trade in with my iPhone.It's slim build and light weight make it easy to carry and use. Especially for the 5inch screen it has!Summary:All together I love the new HTC one M8, Its battery life is so much better, its camera fits my needs, and the BoomSound is amazing. I recommend this phone to anyone, whether you are working constantly or just like to play games. I cant find anything I dont like about this phone.",2014年5月24日 在美国审核

All-around champ of phones - and gorgeous too!,"I have been using the One M8 for three months now, and it still feels just as current and robust now as it did on the day I got it.I had been using the original One (M7) before getting the M8, and I can say that the M8 is an improvement in every way.Although it is still not perfect, the M8's camera is a noticeable improvement over the M7's.Images are sharper and I do get better results with daylight shots, both with auto setting and by tweaking the focus point.The ability to take low-light shots remains excellent and the dual flash brightens very dark settings very naturally.The Gallery and photo editing features are much more robust now too, especially with the second camera making some cool effects possible.It does take some practice to get the best effect out of the UFocus feature though.Boomsound is a great feature when you want to play some video or music for a friend, or just ambient listening - the sound is clear and not at all grating.I also like the Motion Gestures - similar features haven't always worked well on other phones but Motion Gestures work great on the One M8. It is great to be able to answer a call just by putting the phone to your ear without hitting Answer.Battery life has been superb!On a normal moderate use day I have yet to deplete even half my battery power.On a long day of heavy usage I haven't really had to worry much about the battery dying, especially now that the Extreme Power Saver feature is available.It is a powerful, well optimized phone too - have not experienced any hiccups with it, it does anything you throw at it fast and very smoothly.Finally, the updated design is SEXY, not just to look at but also to the touch - the gunmetal gray version is gorgeous!This phone has both beauty and brawn, and will continue to be by my side for quite awhile to come.",2014年6月26日 在美国审核
Damn best phone I've ever owned,"The good:- Good size/shape; can use well with one *and* two hands- Absolutely beautiful software *and* hardware- Can't break it- Good camera (not as many pixels, but the better quality thanks to the camera quality and the additional depth camera make up for it)- The speakers... Dear God.They're powerful enough that sometimes I forget they're phone speakersThe bad:- Touchscreen is a tad too sensitive, to the point where it's even wiped itself while in my pocket due to too many PIN attempts.A case with a screen protector is a decent workaroundThe ugly:- The autocorrect is a bit overzealous sometimes- Battery isn't user-replaceable as far as I can tell- Can't uninstall the Facebook app.I *hate* the Facebook app.",2014年8月14日 在美国审核
"Something new, Something fresh and never looking back","For many many years I've been a Samsung customer and it seems with each iteration I keep falling for the same gimmicky features, but you have to ask yourself if you really need them, sure they seem nice but they bog down the system, it causes lag and frequent crashes over an extended use. After being frustrated with the S3 I saw a commercial about the new HTC One M8 and figured I'd give it a go.The Pros:Man I can't tell you just the instant gratification upon feeling this device, it really does have a solid build quality to it, rather than holding an object that feels more like a toy (Glares at the S3). The system/OS is smooth as butter, if I could I would slap that on some toast and eat it I would, it's that damn good. The display is nice and bright, colors are more natural and feels more on point rather than the over saturated Samsung AMOLED displays. The sounds are bombastic, night and day compared to S3 due to Boomsound front facing speakers. The on screen capacitive buttons aren't a big deal for me, I actually like them.Cons-My only gripe is the camera quality, its not terrible, it's not great it's somewhere right in the middle and if you take a lot of night/low light shots it excels here-Not a major gripe here but it's noticeable, phone is a bit slippery and a bit heavier but the trade offs is totally okay in my book but for some users it may be an issue.I can't see myself going back to Samsung products after giving this a go, if you are on the fence you needn't fear, take the plunge cause I certainly don't regret it.",2014年5月7日 在美国审核

I've been with HTC for 5 years now and it's been a great run but it's time for some change,"Bare with me here for I've got some things to say about the HTC m8. I've been with HTC for 5 years now and it's been a great run but it's time for some change. I loved the HTC One X and I was excited about the HTC m7, but I couldn't get a new phone with my contract, so I waited for the m8 expecting major changes, but there was many from the m7. Besides the speakers which I honestly think the only biggest factor for me keeping this phone, everything was only decent. The speed is alright, and the camera is quite poor for my taste. I've been using my friends phone like the LG or the one plus one phone or the iphone 6 and its way, way better. I don't know whether it's their processor or their battery life or camera or OS but it seems way better than my phone now...With that being said, if HTC m9 doesn't give me significant changes, I'm going to switch for good.

The screen went out in my phone. I bought it used. Htc asked me for the original receipt. Since it was bought used I had no receipt. Screenshot the original transaction and confirmation email saying I purchased it and sent it to them.

"Beautiful, fast phone with a few niggling problems","Much has been written about the awesome hardware and design of the latest HTC flagship phone.Having the phone in hand for three months now, I'll confirm that the apps and Kit Kat navigation usually run silky smooth and wicked fast.The speakers and sound quality are hands down the best in the smart phone business. The problems I found are relatively minor, though significant enough to lower my review score from 5 to 4 stars.Mypicky-ness grows out of the six hundred plus doll hair price tag, which raises my expectations. I'll spill most of my pixel ink on the bitching and throw in some moaning for good measure.HTC Sense keyboard:50 points deducted from House Griffendor for LACK OF A NUMERIC KEYPAD FUNCTIONALITY in the HTC Sense keyboard.Today I was using the phone to complete my Driver License renewal application.Certain fields required long sequences of numbers and I hate, hate, HATE using the crappy, horizontally laid out number pad (as you find directly above your QWERTY keyboard) for numeric entry.So.Damned. Tedious.If you fill out a lot of form stuff on-line (e.g. booking travel, setting up new shopping accounts, adding phone contacts manually), this may really stick in your craw.Transferred Videos Formatted Upside Down:I remove the SD card (awesome upgrade from the M7) to transfer my video mp4 files onto my Windows laptop, only to discover every single video file plays upside down on WMP and VLC. Grrrrr! I've been able to find NO EASY FIXES. The software fixes require time-consuming video-recoding which sometimes degrade video quality.I make lots of movies with this phone (very good video), but this bug really hobbles usability of the videos once they leave the phone's storage.C'mon guys.Video orientation isn't rocket science.Image Stabilization Removed:This isn't a huge issue if you're up to speed on the Zoe Photo shooting style (photos are mini-videos essentially).But the Zoe interface is less user friendly compared to the M7 phone.You're now required to press and hold the shutter icon instead of an automatic 3 second Zoe made with a single tap.Basically, single snap photos come out with more shaky/blurry results, so you're kind of forced to rely on Zoe mode, which is 90% awesome and 10% tedious.Auto-hiding Home button and Back button:Annoyingly, HTC made the M8 model with on-screen BACK, HOME, and recently-used APP buttons, instead of the dedicated capacitive buttons of the M7.The upside is you get more screen real estate to work with, but now those 3 buttons auto-hide and tapping your screen to get them to scroll back into view sometimes disrupts your current open app.Those are the annoyances on my radar.They represent less than 3% of my day-to-day experience, so I still love this device (and feel so much better having vented a bit with you, dear reader).At this price point, I would hope for something a little closer to perfection.In fact, HTC's prior generation One device (M7), is a phone I actually love a bit more than the M8...even though the specs are a bit more modest.If you're new to the HTC/Android phone market, I would actuallly recommend going with the M7 which is now an easy 5-star device at its Fore Hun Dread Buck price point (as of 07/2014).",2014年7月7日 在美国审核

HTC One M8A is a dream to use if you enjoy flashing ROMs,"I'd give it a five but some of the reviews are correct; HTC does not upgrade the Android software in this device to my satisfaction.If you own the Windows Phone version of this device; it's worse, Microsoft and HTC once again stuck it to their mobile device users.I own that device and hacked the registry so Verizon Wireless would believe it's a Lumia 735.Where the M8 Android shines is that this device can easily be bootloader unlocked and there are a gazillion ""rooted"" ROMs which one of them will suit your fancy.It's one of the positives I have for the HTC devices.This is by far one of the best phones I've ever used and as of this typing there are ROMs available that use Android 7.x Nougat.And again as of this typing you can find this device for under $100 brand new.My next device will continue to be a HTC and for those of you who were crazy enough like me to use a Windows Phone, we all know why, don't we!",2017年7月25日 在美国审核

All in all, I would definitely buy another HTC if they keep rolling out these beastly phones! As a side note though, the camera could use an upgrade. But this is the ONLY phone on the market with DUAL cameras! The top camera acts like a depth sensor, and I should also mention that you can customize the settings for the camera as if it was a DSLR!

... the bat that I don't care as much about smart phones as a lot of people seem to,"I have to say off the bat that I don't care as much about smart phones as a lot of people seem to. I don't get the overwhelming desire to constantly upgrade and have the latest and greatest phone. I do use my phone exstenively throughout the day, usually for non-demanding functions like internet surfing or music/podcasts. I was of the school of thought that there were only two choices if you wanted a quality smart phone: Samsung galaxy or iPhone.However, a few weeks ago I was getting close to my contract ending and being able to replace my GS3. I heard some buzz about this phone and did a little research all the while planning on going with the new Samsung.Boy am I glad I changed my mind. This phone is exactly what I need in a phone. The battery life is incredible and unlike my old galaxy the battery doesn't seem to drain at all if the phone is idle. I often forget to plug it in at night and wake up to it only down 2%. It also seems to charge exponentially faster than my old galaxy.The speakers are great. I have a long commute every day and I usually will play a podcast on my phone during the drive.The phone looks amazing and feels very solid with the metal back.Only negative I have is there seems to be an extraordinary amount of bloatware that I am unable to uninstall without rooting the phone. That kind of thing really bothers me as a customer; I should be the one to decide what is on my phone and I don't think it's right for any app (unless it's vital to normal operation) to be preloaded and not allowed to be uninstalled.Overall though, great 1st impressions with the HTC ONE",2014年8月26日 在美国审核

Pretty Good Cell Phone,"Have had this M8 phone with AT&amp;T service for past two weeks. There is a lot that I like and a little that I dislike. AT&amp;T service has been awesome with no dropped calls and very few upload issues to social media sites. The first one (amber gold) I got had a screen issue and the box store (BB) that I got it at replaced it with a grey metal one. Got it for $1 plus the usual service contract renewal charge, so I cannot complain too much.What I like: The sound is amazing. Best I have ever heard. Not only for music but also for conference calls I take for my job. Putting speakers on top and bottom is a genius design. All cell phones should do this. The headphones work perfectly when having conversations or listening to music. It is very very fast. Apps start in a second. No stupid lags or frozen phone screen like my S3. The UI is certainly different than Samsung UI but I have adapted. The battery charges very fast and it lasts a very long time. The extreme power save feature has not been necessary so far. The 32 GB internal storage along with the mini-SD card will last me a long time. Most close-up pictures I took in the sunlight and under dark conditions (with flash on) were very clear with good skin colors. The 5 inch screen and display is excellent. I put a glass protector over it even though it has Gorilla glass. The size is big enough so I don't always need my reading glasses. The weight is different. Before you buy one, hold it in one hand as if you are making a call to see if you can handle the weight. Then hold it in two hands and see if you can text in landscape and in portrait modes without any wrist strain. Coming from the cheap plastic and light weight S3 to the M8 was tough on my wrists. This M8 feels like a real phone due to the metal case but it took time to get used to the increased weight. I almost returned it due to the weight. My wrists will be a lot stronger in two years from now lol. The blue-tooth sometimes gets unpaired in my car but I can quickly re-pair it. Had the same issue with my S3. The reception in my car has been great for me and the people I talked to. It does not get hot when I am using it for a long time or when charging it.What I didn't like: The Blinkfeed feature is silly. When I want to read the social media sites or the news sites, I will. Social media sites are not my priority. Making phone calls or texting someone are my priorities. Having to swipe a screen to make a call was just too much for me. I deleted the Blinkfeed page and made the screen with the clock and weather my home page. The stock HTC keyboard is terrible.The keys were too small for my fingers and I made a lot of text mistakes. So I replaced it with the Swiftkey app and used its ""full"" keyboard. It has really made a difference for me. I can text fast again. Swiftkey also has a thumbs keyboard that I like to use when my phone is on landscape. The camera zoom sucks since it is only 4MP. The rear facing camera is better than the front facing one and that is very odd. Up close pics come out very good but if you routinely take pics from far places, then do not buy this phone or bring a real camera with you. There is one other thing that I just do not like with this phone and will not enjoy for the next 2 years. The ""soft keys"" are in the wrong place on this phone. The soft key to return to the previous screen, the Home soft key and the recent apps soft key are too close to the keyboard. I am frequently ""saving my text messages to draft"" when my thumb accidentally hits the ""Home soft key"" as I press the space bar on the keyboard. I am forced to re-open the text via the recent apps key so I can finish what I wanted to write and send it to someone. They should not have placed those soft keys where they are. The real estate on the phone for the HTC logo serves no visible purpose and perhaps the next model will move these soft buttons somewhere else. I wish the battery could be replaced by me like I did with Galaxy S3 but I will carry a portable charger when I think I won't be near an outlet or in my car for a very long time.I am keeping this phone for 2 years. I have moved all of my pics and music to it and customized it well. I will enjoy its sound and usage. It works fast enough for me to save time and the size or weight are not big issues with me although it is very large and heavy. I did not like the Galaxy S5 (with its stupid charger port cover) and I won't go Iphone again. I enjoy the Android OS and the HTC implementation of it. The One M9 or M10 needs to fix some things. I am glad that I didn't settle for the models that many have chosen like the Iphone6 or the S5.I wanted a change from Samsung with a quality phone and I think I got it. When I show it to my friends, few have heard of HTC and their line of phones but they like the sound and screen display. I will live with ""returning to my text messages"" after I hit the Home key but I will curse HTC when it occurs. I am a music lover and this phone rocks for playing music that I upload to this phone. I do not need to bring a portable speaker when I am outside. It is the loudest phone available today. I am giving it 4 stars because of the soft key issue I am having and the low megapixels in its front facing lens. It really is a great phone for calls, texts and apps. If you can handle the weight and size and do not take pics from very far, then go get one.",2014年12月29日 在美国审核
BoomSound is amazing!,"HTC sent me an M8 for testing last month. I fell in love with it once I heard it play music, while M7 BoomSound was already marvellous, HTC still manage to improve it for M8. The quality is so good that one day my phone ring and I totally ignore it as I thought I was playing music with my desktop speaker until the music stop abruptly, then I realize it was a phone call! I usually listen to music using MacBook with a pair of fair speakers, and I actually heard some details that I never heard before when I play the music using M8. My friend gets an M8 after listening a song on my phone later! This is how good the BoomSound is.In addition BoomSound, three-dimensional effect of the UltraPixel also gave me loads of fun. It has a lot of user friendly effect.BlinkFeed is also great for showing information that you are interested in but seldom have time to keep track -- it will display them in a neat way on your home screen. Now I can get cool ideas and news by scrolling the home screen. You can customize what type of information you would like to see easily too.In addition, the battery life of M8 is good. It is last for a whole day without recharging. M8 is also a TV remote control with integrated TV information, you can simply select your desired TV program, M8 will automatically turn on the TV to the corresponding channel so you don't need to look up the channel number yourself.Overall, M8 is a really good phone.",2014年6月25日 在美国审核
A viable replacement for an iPhone; One of the Most Competitive Android Devices on the Market,"After extensive research on the specs, price, and operating system of this device, I purchased this to replace my aging iPhone 4 (8gb) [unlocked from AT&amp;T and used on wifi only]. I needed to purchase a device that will function quickly and efficiently as a smartphone to text and receive emails during my time at college, and I have not been disappointed. After using this for several weeks, I can report that it is snappy, clean, and neat, all around, and even easier to use than an iPhone at times.The outside of the phone is all solid metal all around, with only the display being glass. It is solidly constructed, but large and slippery. I recommend a case or a skin to keep the phone from slipping out of your hand. It's also a tall phone with the navigation buttons onscreen now, so it may not fit as easily in pockets and the like as the M7 or other smaller phones.Android 5.0 (the most recent update to this operating system available for this device) is very crisp, fast, and memory efficient. The phone handles it well, experiencing little to no lag whatsoever. The snappy 2.3 ghz processor is certainly doing its job.The phone's 32 gb of ROM is ample, and serves everyday needs perfectly well. There is a micro SD card slot on the side for expandable memory up to 128 Gb, so storage is hardly an issue with this device.The 1080p display is brilliant, showing crisp and bright images and video. The screen seems somewhat brighter than that of the previous generation M7, though the pixel density is slightly lower, given this phone's larger display (both phones are the same pixel count though this one has a larger screen). This, however, does not at all impact the clarity of the images from a practical standpoint, and the average user couldn't tell the difference without a magnifying glass. The increase in brightness and responsiveness over the previous phone is worth this tiny drop in pixel density, and the larger display really shines when watching movies and playing games. When compared to the same size display on an iPhone 6, one can clearly see the superiority of the HTC's display, in clarity if not brightness.The BoomSound speakers on the top and bottom of the phone are absolutely incredible. A struggle I remember from my iPhone 4 was trying to show a friend a video or song over the speakers and not being able to hear it in an environment with moderate ambient noise without putting the phone up to your ear. With this phone, volume is never a problem. The speakers can go anywhere from bedtime quiet to offensively loud in a quiet room, and in a louder setting, they can still be heard without too much trouble, though a bluetooth speaker is never a bad investment if you're going to be in a large room. These stereo-quality speakers are really a plus for HTC and should be standard on more phones. Using any phone other than this one and hearing a lower-quality speaker is disappointing.The selfie camera is sharper than most (5 MP), providing flattering (and not-so-flattering) detail for those dedicated to snapchat and social media. The front cameras provide an adequate photography experience, though not an impressive one. The photos from the front (Dual 4 MP) offer a dull color palette, but are sharp and clear on a 1080p display when not zoomed in on. The two cameras allow for some cool effects, such as interactive 3D view of photos (the image appears to be 3-dimensional when the phone is tilted slightly). Unless you're looking for something to serve as your ""side arm"" when your Canon T5i is out of battery or whatnot, the camera here is perfectly adequate. It's hardly great by any standard, but certainly isn't bad either.Battery life on this phone is rather meh. I previously owned an M7, which I purchased used off of Amazon and promptly returned. That phone's battery life lasted 3 hours from a full charge. This phone is significantly better than that, and seems to keep up with iPhone 4's and 5's fairly well. With normal use, I can make it last a day and then some. Obviously, if used without stop, the phone will use up battery quicker, and certain apps and games are more power-hungry than others. Performing normal tasks, such as email and texting, maybe a download from the play store here and there, you can get about 6 hours out of the battery with the screen being on the entire time. Turning the screen off when not using will significantly increase this figure.When considering battery life for this device, it is worth noting that I do not use this phone with a service plan, but simply use WiFi networks to perform all texting, calls, and data-related tasks. This may have some impact on the phone, compared to having a data plan, but I have not found the battery life to be a handicap.A very important thing to consider with battery life is that this phone will not do well with 3rd party chargers. If you use any wall charger for this device other than the official HTC quickcharger (http://www.htc.com/us/accessories/#!pid=htc-one-m8&amp;acc=htc-rapid-charger-2), the charge time will take hours (up to 8) and will not charge at all if the phone is being used while charging. The HTC quickcharger will juice up the phone to 80-100% in 90-120 minutes or so.The google play store is very competitive with Apple's app store, offering a similar, in fact, hardly distinguishable variety of apps, games, and features. No complaints here, and downloads are very fast. The google play store does not require passwords every time you install an app, unlike the app store, which makes editing and adding programs faster and easier.The quick-settings menu is on the top of the screen on android, rather than the bottom, as in iOS. This is strange at first, but becomes easier and more intuitive with time. Notifications are similar to those on apple. You dismiss them by swiping left or right rather than up. Unlike apple notifications, android notifications stay in the queue until the app is opened or they are dismissed. Turning the phone display off and then back on, you will still have notifications populate the lock screen if they were present in the notifications queue, unlike apple, which removes all notifications from the lock screen every time the phone is unlocked. This is a much better way of doing things, as it makes it harder for users to forget items of importance.The touch keyboard on the device is excellent, and the vibrate feedback, though weaker than on the M7, is still snappy and responsive, giving the keyboard a nice, tactile feel to it.Below are the specs list for both the M8 and the iPhone 6 for comparison. When it comes down to it, people usually stick with the operating system they are used to and comfortable with, but between these two phones, when price is considered, the M8 definitely comes out on top. (Understood that there is an M9 which is more of a direct competitor with the iPhone 6, but I felt that the iPhone 5 wasn't as direct a comparison with the M8, given the display size and nature of each phone).iPhone 6: http://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_6-6378.phpHTC One M8: http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_one_(m8)-6074.phpIt is worth considering the $300 price tag before purchasing. One can find an M7 for significantly cheaper (between $120-$200, depending on condition and carrier), but you have to be careful, as these older phones can sometimes have greatly shortened battery lives due to their age.All around a great device. The only real negatives are the camera and the price. The camera, though not stunning, is more than adequate for everyday use for 80-90% of users (the only real exceptions being photographers, who should have cameras anyway....). The price is to be expected for a device of this quality and build, and though steep, is better than most iPhone models available.",2015年7月12日 在美国审核
"One of the best phones I've ever owned, hands down.","This is by far one of the best phones I've owned. Before this one, I had a Galaxy S5 Active, and I'd definitely consider this an upgrade.The Good:Screen size is just right for my needs, and the display is gorgeous. When I first powered up the phone and started installing all my apps it got fairly hot, but with the update to Android 6.0 that has no longer been an issue (thanks to optimization tweaks by HTC). The aluminum body makes the phone feel very sturdy in your hand, but not too heavy at the same time. The quad-core processor offers very nice speed, able to handle any app you throw at it (not sure about gaming, as I don't use my phone for that, but I hear it handles 3D gaming just fine).Now, the best part...audio quality. By far, this is the best experience I've ever had with a phone. I'm a bit of a wannabe audiophile, so I like good sound quality. It excels in all fields in that regard. The front facing speakers offer great volume to share videos or music with friends. On top of that, the 3.5mm out performs just as spectacularly if not better. I can crank the volume up to the point it's uncomfortable with minimal distortion and almost no crosstalk between left and right channels. I use an aftermarket music app to play high quality FLAC files and they sound just wonderful. The HTC BoomSound plugin does a good job of improving sound as well, bumping the volume of just the right frequencies to achieve a fairly neutral sound on headphones with little midrange or bass, as well as boosting the soundstage. A true music lovers phone, for sure. (Movies sound great as well). Add support for up to 128gb SD card, and you get a very happy customer (as well as a new HTC fanboy).The Bad:Battery life could be a little better on its own, tho thankfully the Battery Saver function gives it a good boost. Without, it'll last give or take 8 hours. With Battery Saver, I can push 12+ with regular use. The lack of a removable back is a bit of a downer, as you cannot replace the battery on your own (personally that doesn't bother me much tho). I'd like a touch more RAM, but to be fair I rarely push the limit (even with 10 apps open at once while playing music).Other than that, I've found very few reasons not to give this phone a gold medal! If you need a new phone and want a great experience, I highly suggest getting an HTC ONE.",2016年5月21日 在美国审核
"First, after having this phone for about a month ...","First, after having this phone for about a month, it suffered a short drop (about a foot or so) and the screen shattered. Thankfully, though, HTC offered the ""Uh-Oh"" protection.Now, they didn't actually repair your phone and send it back, they kept your phone and sent a refurbished one, so you do NOT get your original phone back....that's not listed on the ""Uh-Oh"" protection description, lol. Funnily enough, same thing happened to the wifes phone a week outside of the Uh-Oh protection window.Then, one day two months after receiving my refurbished phone,while the phone is charging on a cross country drive, it suddenly shuts off, never to turn on again.First chance I get, I call and speak with an HTC rep who assures me that my phone is under warranty since I've had it less than two months (the replacement phone).WELL, once the phone has been sent in, I get notified that it's going to cost $350 fix.The repair tech is saying the phone hadwater damage..and when I tell them that I've only had the phone for two months and its never been wet, he says that it was possibly due to ""atmospheric moisture""...lol, wow.First phone that I've had that was as frail as this one.Do yourself a favor, and don't buy.",2015年9月23日 在美国审核

"The best ""One"" I've ever had.","Okay, so like most people, I've owned my fair share of smart phones. I've had flip phones and brick phones, an iPhone, and several Android devices, so I feel I have a fairly decent idea of what to expect when it comes to a good phone. The HTC One m8 completely blows my expectations out of the water.First Impressions:Right from the moment the T-mobile salesman hands me the box I can feel the weight of it, something I personally love. The first glimpse of the actual phone brought me back to being a little kid on Christmas morning. You can see it oozes quality craftsmanship with its clean lines, subtle curves, and brushed aluminum embodiment of pure awesomeness.I pull it out of its box and remove the layers of plastic distraction to fully reveal the beauty within. As I said before, this phone is not a lightweight; at 160g you can feel the heft of its construction. I turn it on and the green “HTC” logo lights up the spacious 5” display. I can immediately see how crisp and clean the picture is, courtesy of the 1920x1080 pixel piece of engineering. The stupid T-mobile jingle plays through the BoomSound speakers, and even that annoying bit of commercialism makes me smile because I’ve never heard it clearer from a phone. All in all it’s off to a great start.Hardware Specs/Build Quality:So as I’ve now said twice, the phone is built solid. It has a brushed aluminum unibody made with “zero gap” construction (as it sounds, there are no visible gaps on the outside of the phone between materials). I cannot express how much I love the feel of this phone, I really can’t, I’m not sure it’s humanly possible, but I’ll try. T-mobile released the m8 the same day as the Galaxy S5, so I had an opportunity to handle both phones before making my purchase. The S5 might have a few more fancy features than the m8, but wow does it feel flimsy; just as flimsy as every other Galaxy product out there. I’ve owned two Galaxy phones now, and while I liked them for their features and performance, both phones succumbed to their poor manufacturing quality (ie cracked button bezel that led to cracked screen, and then just a cracked screen). In contrast, my last HTC phone, the MyTouch 4G, is like three years old and still perfect. Don’t get me wrong, it’s scratched to hell, but my Father-in-law, whom I sold it to, still uses it every day for a myriad of apps without complaint. Okay, enough about HTC’s awesome build quality, you get it, they rock. The new internals of the m8 surely don't disappoint; it sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, a 2.3 GHz quad core processor accompanied by 2GB of ddr3 ram. It also has 32GB of internal memory, with yes, an expandable microSD slot for up to 128GB of storage space. I don't know the person who needs that much space on their phone, but whoever they are, I'm sure they're extra pleased about that. The speakers on this thing sound great. Personally I hated the gimmicky nature of “Beats by Dre” that were found on the m7 (though I admit they sounded great), so I wasn’t unhappy to see the m8 lose them. The BoomSound speakers that now adorn the m8 sound awesome (for a phone, mind you); not to mention the awesomeness factor of them being placed on the front of the phone. The screen looks great; I really can’t imagine a clearer picture, but then again, when your phone with a 5” screen has the same resolution as your TV with a 60” screen, it stands to reason the picture will be REALLY clear. The last thing I wanted to address was the ever so controversial “bezel” on the front of the phone. My honest opinion is that it does nothing to detract from the phone. Yes, the screen could be larger without it, or maybe the phone could be shorter, but come on, talk about nitpicking. The phone is awesome and I personally have no qualms with a half inch strip of glass proudly displaying “htc” on the front of my awesome HTC phone, but hey, what do I know?Cameras:I felt the cameras deserved their own section as they are a point of controversy of actual merit, unlike the bezel. The rear cameras (yes, I said cameras, as in plural) are a very interesting feature on this phone. The main camera is more or less the same as was featured on the m7, a 4-megapixel sensor. While 4-megapixels may seem small compared to most other high-end phones out there ( like the Sony Xperia Z1 and its 20.1 megapixel behemoth), there is a reason to the madness; the Ultrapixel. That’s right; the sensor is almost twice the size of normal phone camera sensors, which allows it to take in over 300% more light. Why is that good? Well, considering many pictures people take these days are in low-light areas (ie restaurants, concerts, anywhere at night, etc), the Ultrapixel allows you to take much clearer pictures during those times you might not be in perfect light (ie most of the time). The second rear camera is a new feature, and a damn cool one at that. It captures distance information and then allows you to adjust the focus of the pictures. Oh, and did I mention you can adjust the focus AFTER you take the picture? Yeah, it’s that cool. This also means you can take pictures much quicker than with other phones. It really is pretty nifty, and I must admit I have spent several hours just messing with the cameras and the different things you can do to the pictures (nerd alert). Finally, the front facing camera boasts a full 5 megapixels so you can take that perfect selfie. Not something I personally give a hoot about, but hey, it’s there.Software/User Interface:Obviously the latest high-end phone is going to launch with the latest Android update. The Android 4.4.2 KitKat is very smooth and pretty, as expected. The extra features that HTC throws in are pretty cool too. One of my favorites is the “Power Saver” mode it has on the drag down menu. That combined with the 2600mA/h battery lets the phone last all day and then some with fairly heavy use. I must admit that I’m not a fan of the “BlinkFeed” screen, and have yet to find a way to turn it off, but luckily it’s only the left window of the home screen. All in all the UI is very snappy and responsive. Most phones these days can claim the same, but it’s nice nevertheless. Another kind of nifty feature is that you can tap the screen twice to wake it up to the lock screen, or you can bypass the lock screen altogether by simply swiping up.Brass tacks:The phone is built to last, has the latest internals, has a truly awesome camera setup, and exudes “premium” at every turn. I know I will be enjoying this phone for a good long while. As the self-proclaimed most indecisive person in the world, I have to say I’m not feeling even an inkling of buyer’s remorse.It doesn’t have every gadget and doodad in the Galaxy (pun intended), and it might not be the great conversationalist that SIRI is, but in my opinion, it’s the best mainstream phone on the market, hands down.",2014年4月15日 在美国审核
"HTC One M8, HTC Actually Improved the M7","I have had the HTC One M8 for about a month maybe a little over. I absolutely love this device. I feel like it will never have any issues. I am not worried about dropping it or putting it in a case, which speak to the build quality of the device. The motion launch gestures took some getting used to, but once I did, it became a very useful trick. Especially during those times in bed where using two hands is just too tiring. The sound quality is similar to the HTC One M7, and so that means it is fantastic. I am a YouTube junkie, and usually am watching videos while outside. So being able to hear them without having to carry my headphones around is a big plus. I love the Duo camera features. UFocus has become one of my norms now when taking pics. Although I wish these features were available when taking photos under manual settings and not just when using “auto”. I find that I don’t need to charge my device every day, though I do charge it at night due to habit. I am a heavy user so my battery can drain at any moment, this is why I also love the addition of the Extreme Power Saving Mode-haven’t had to use it yet, but nice to know it’s there. Calls come in clear, when T-Mobiles network allows me to, and video quality is perfect. I am not sure what else to say, I absolutely love the HTC One M8, and if you’re considering it, than I hope this has helped you to make the right decision.",2014年6月4日 在美国审核

You can tap the screen to bring the phone out of sleep without pushing a button, but this isn't a good thing. Too many times I've had the phone activate itself in my pocket and make phone calls or open apps. Not cool.4. Phone crashes sometimes and restarts itself for no particular reason.In addition, the speakers that were so widely praised aren't even that great. I've heard a lot of other phones with smaller speakers (that don't increase their height) that have sounded just as good and we're just as loud or even louder.Another feature that was widely praised was the fancy all metal construction.

Zoomed in on all of them and it was clear in every picture that the S4 camera was better.On a near flawless phone you have to have a better camera than last years competition!- No Removable battery.Perhaps this is why the device has an absolutely flawless exterior but I would have really liked to see a removable battery.- Not waterproof.I know, you can't have it all but if you could get this in there that would really cover every base.",2014年4月10日 在美国审核

Two Defects in Just 2 Months.,"I purchased an HTC One M8 back in July.My third phone from HTC.After just 3 weeks of use the speaker and microphone membranes at the top and bottom of the LCD began to come off.I called HTC and they exchanged it for me.I had to pay $29 so that they would send me a replacement phone, otherwise I would have been without a phone for up to 10 days.A week after receiving the replacement phone I started noticing white streaking on the phones lcd.I called HTC again, and once again I had to pay $29 for them to advance ship me a phone.Last week I received an email stating that the issue with the phone was LCD bleeding, it was not covered under warranty and I was going to be charged $200 for repair.I called HTC, and after 45 minutes of getting the runaround, I was transferred to someone who basically told me... too bad, so sad, you're going to pay it, then hung up.I immediately I called my credit card company (Capitol One Visa) to dispute the charge.They closed my account to prevent the charge from processing, but the agent told me that it looked like HTC had an arrangement with Visa that allowed them to charge accounts that had been closed.Fishy, right?Sure enough, I found a charge of $200 on my credit card account this morning.What to do???I really want to file a small claims suite against them.I'd certainly win and receive costs, because the truth is a big company can't afford to fight a $350 lawsuit.But, is it really worth my time and negative energy?Probably not!!!So, I'm left here wondering, why would a multibillion dollar corporation treat customers like this?What are we talking about here?Maybe $25 in parts and labor, which doesn't even qualify as a rounding error in HTC's accounting system.I feel sorry for the people who work at HTC and have to enforce these ludicrous policies passed down from from execs who don't have to answer directly to the consumer.Too bad for HTC, this is one customer who will be looking elsewhere when it comes time to upgrade.If your considering purchasing an HTC One M8, or any phone from HTC, give them a call and check for yourself what the warranty policies are.",2014年10月21日 在美国审核

The (New)ONE to Rule Them All!,"I love HTC phones and I have both last year's One(m7) and this year's(m8). I am NOT affiliated with HTC or compensated by them in any way. I just feel that competition and the underdog companies are crucial and essential for a healthy free market economy, and ultimately, us consumers. I have had the iPhones 4 through 5s, Samsung Galaxy S3/S4 and Note 2/3, and several Nokia(n95-97, n84/85 and several lesser phones) and Sony/Sony-Ericsson(Xperia) phones over the years, and I have loved most of them. For a healthy and positive technological evolution, we NEED the small or struggling companies like HTC to succeed. If Apple and Samsung become duopolies, that will be a dark future indeed. Pick up an HTC One(M7 or M8) and any Samsung Galaxy phones and compare the quality and craftsmanship, and tell me why it's Samsung and not HTC that have more successful phones. It's all about the MONEY and marketing, the bigger guy trying to squeeze out the smaller guy, and that's NOT how a healthy free market economy should be.Now that that is out of the way, let us get down to the nitty gritty. This is my direct comparisons to the iPhone 5s, Samsung Galaxy S4/S5 and Note 3, but mainly to the last HTC One(M7)(and yes, I am mainly updating keypoints from the m7 review):The Good:1) THE SCREEN: If there was such a better screen on a phone, I have not yet seen it. The iPhone 5s is lauded for its excellent screen, but at its current resolution, it trails behind the One's screen by far. Everything just POPS out at you. Even in direct sunlight, everything is CLEAR and BRIGHT. I really loved the 2013 HTC One's(M7) screen, but once again HTC has outdone itself and given us a true masterpiece in 5.0"" 1080p(440ppi) form. The main difference between the M8 and the M7 is the color reproduction on the M8 is better and more true-to-life. This is THE BEST screen on the planet right now - WOW!!!2) THE DESIGN/HARDWARE: Once again, the new One continues the HTC tradition of making really high-quality phones with high-class material and craftsmanship. This version has more of a matted-brushed aluminum finish than the glossier M7. The One feels THICK and TOUGH. I don't have to worry about carrying this around case-less(except from drops, which is a whole other issue). I will not be worried about this phone nicking and scraping like the iPhone 5/5s. Personally, it may not have the flair of some of the Sony and Nokia phone of the past, but in totality the One has the best combination of design and craftsmanship. It oozes style and sophistication, unlike the plastic-y feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5. The One is one real looker!3) THE DUAL FRONT-FACING SPEAKERS: We have all been desensitized to the modern smartphones nowadays with their crappy, tinny, mono speaker. I remember the days of the Nokia n95 and n84 with their stereo speakers - whatever happened to phones after that? Whoever agreed to a mono/solo speaker with all the smartphones thereafter?? FINALLY, someone has the senses to come back to reality - thank you, HTC!. Trust me, your ears will thank you and you will realize all phones should have been made like this. Especially when you use ringtones/alerts that were specifically created for this phone, the sound is loud, immersive, expansive, and POPs into your ears. It's simply a re-revolution. Compared to the M7, the M8 loses the Beats audio engineering, but it actually sounds louder than the M7, which although has really high-quality speakers as well, was known for being too soft in certain scenarios. The new moniker is just BoomSound.4) THE CAMERA: I don't use my phone camera to make prints from photos, I have my dedicated cameras for that. So to me, the paramount function of phone cameras is the convenience/accessibility - it has to be able to capture what I want quickly and clearly, with decent enough quality to post online. Therefore, the 4MP size in the One's camera does not bother me at all. Who cares if the camera isn't THE BEST phone camera ever? Because it is not, but it is a GREAT low-light shooter, and to me that's more important than pixel count. The sensors in the camera are bigger than other phone cameras, therefore, it can capture a lot more light, which in laymen's terms it can give you better photos in more situations than other phone cameras can. Also, the touch spot focus is almost instantaneous - this camera is quick, quick, quick! What's really cool about the new camera is the duo camera functionality - each photo you snap is recorded from both cameras, so afterwards, you can re-focus the image, ala Lytro camera style. This is really cool and quite revolutionary for a phone camera. So in the real world, this means no more out-of-focus photos! You can now always re-focus your photos after the fact, so you will not have to regret missing out on a great memory because your photo was out of focus - awesome!5) For a phone with a 5"" screen, it's quite svelte, at least at the girth. It's easier to hold in the hand than the Samsung Galaxy S4/S5, and for sure a heckuva lot better than the Note 3. It fits in your hands nicely and securely, with just the right combination of size, weight, and balance. However, it is very TALL, even taller than the M7, so trying to reach the power button with one hand while your holding it in a normal position is almost impossible. HOWEVER...6) The One borrows the features of the LG G2 where you can double tap on the screen while it's off, to turn it on! While the screen is off, you can swipe left to turn it on to see Blinkfeed, which is HTC's version of Flipboard/news reader, and swipe right to turn it on to the home screen. The one thing HTC forgot though, is you can't double-tap the screen while it's on, to turn it off, which the LG G2 CAN do.7) The user interface(UI) and software design is now even more polished,minimal, and simplistic. Sense 6.0 is the on-going improvement from the previous versions. It's really quick and light, not bloated like Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It improves on the older, but still good, Sense 5.0 and 5.5. You can move from one screen to the next lightning quick, almost as good as the iPhone UI.8) And FINALLY, HTC has included a microSD slot so you can add your own memory card for more storage(the HTC DNA/Butterfly and M7 didn't have any). You can add up to 128gb more!The Bad and Ugly:1) The battery is only 2600mAh - I wish it was bigger because I'm one of those paranoid people who always needs my phone at fully charged, just in case, of you know, something. But so far it's been holding steady at about 40% at the end of the day(from 9am-6pm). I check emails, read the news, text, Facebook, etc. throughout the day - I would say that I'm a moderate to heavy user. At least it is a lot better than the M7's 2300mAh battery, which drains super quick, yet charges SUPER SLOW.2) Comparing features with the Samsung S4/S5, the One is not as good. It's not a deal breaker, but for those who like fancy functions, the One will not make you as happy. The HTC One is very simple in its feature set. The one feature I miss most from the new Samsung phones is Smart Stay, where the phone can sense that you're looking at the screen, and won't dim/turn off the screen - that was a HUGE convenience for when you're watching a movie or reading the news. The coolest feature so far for the One has been the tap/swipe to turn the screen on.3) Like I wrote earlier, the size is both good and bad, and it's also heavier than most similar phones. It's taller than the S4/S5, and with the power button up on top, it's almost impossible to do one-hand phone operations without shifting your hand up and down to accommodate both the screen gestures and buttons. The buttons(power and volume) don't protrude enough to make it easy to press them.All in all, I feel the combination of the One's screen, design/craftsmanship, and audio experience trumps over the Samsung S4/S5's fancy functions. The S5's screen is almost just as good - AMOLED screens are known for their deep blacks and saturation, while the One's is much better in direct light, and with a more true color reproduction. The S5 has a higher MP camera, therefore able to take better photos in broad daylight, while the One's camera is more versatile and better in low light conditions. The One has a much better audio experience, while the S5 gives you better convenience with its features - userability goes to the S5 for sure.But in the end, considering the totality of things, I feel the new HTC One provides me the best TOTAL experience, and is the king of the smartphones(at least for now!).",2014年3月26日 在美国审核

"Wait, buy later...Why?","I bought the HTC One M8 [Gold] at launch directly from HTC. The phone came when promised, unlocked and ready to go. It is a quality product, no question about it. The hype it received was justified, and right on target. I watched the launch presentation by company executives as it was being streamed online. Great job, HTC at beating the ""Big-boys"" to the market place with an exceptional phone. ""Bravo"". However, the most intriguing aspect of the entire launch was the ""Dot View"" case, and HTC knew it going in, and they dropped the ball. The ""dot View"" cases were not available in any kind of numbers, nor does HTC know when they would become available. it's been nearly a month since launch and no cases. I mean, NONE. After-market suppliers have none and big phone carriers such-as, Verizon [who had exclusivity at launch] Best buy and AT&amp;T, all, have no cases. You may find one on eBay, if your willing to take your chances on ""might haves"" or ""may ship"". Without the ""Dot View"" case the HTC One M8 is just another phone [albeit] a very good one. Had I known the cases would be a problem, I would have waited. With hindsight and a clearer picture, now I see it was better to wait, just to see if HTC would come through with the cases to make the phone the sensation its been to this point. You would think when introduced, everything presented would be available, not in this case. [no pun intended]. 5 stars for the phone, 2 taken away for lack of insight regarding the ""Dot View"" cases availability at this late date.",2014年4月25日 在美国审核

Confused by the positive reviews...,"I recently purchased the HTC One M8 for the AT&amp;T network.I was upgrading from an iPhone 4s. I am a heavy business phone used, with a total of about 50 phone calls a day, plus emails and texts.No games and limited videos. The 4s is superb phone for these purposes, and allows me to accomplish what matters quickly and easily: making money.Recently, I had decided I should get a larger screen, as the 3.5 inch on the 4s is somewhat small when I have to read pdf documents that are emailed to me.After researching a new phone, the HTC seemed like a great one.I use google apps heavily, and thought using an Android phone made sense for compatibility purposes.The larger screen would allow me to better read, edit and process pdf docs for clients and colleagues.However, it soon became apparent that manipulating the larger phone with one hand (while driving, typing or any other task) is much more difficult.You press the wrong buttons often. Additionally, often you have to press the same spot on the phone several times to get action.A task I use heavily, copying the number on a received call in order to paste it in an email to my staff to respond to, is not able to be accomplished with one click and hold.The ergonomics of the phone are poor.It is not comfortable to have up to your ear for long periods of time.Additionally, you can often put the phone to your ear and get poor volume, because you are not on the speaker properly.I never had this problem with my iphone.To be fair, I never put a case on the phone (it did not arrive before I returned the phone after 5 days of use.) A case may have made it more comfortable and easy to manipulate.The absolute deal breaker for me was when I was listening to a voice mail, and I received a call.After pressing the answer button several times, the call was picked up, but my voicemail continued playing! That's right.I had a potential client talking while I was hearing my voice mail as well.Simply an unacceptable bug.In the end, I went back to my iphone 4s, and will wait for a different model to come out.I will definitely avoid such a large phone in the future though.",2014年5月1日 在美国审核

HTC and HTC DESIRE,"Hi, I once bought an HTC DESIRE, the phone was marvelous, fabulous, I loved the operating system capabilities and tweaks that HTC did, was a really amazing phone, I really liked ... my problem was mainly the following, I bought that in a trip to UK, the phone after 7 months started to over heat, reboot, etc etc ... until I couldn't use it anymore. If you search in the internet you will a known factory problem with some devices in that time.The catch here,for you who will buy this, is wait a little to spend 700 bucks on something brand new, making sure you dont end up in my situation, without a global WARRANTY ! this is very important, make sure they will fix or replace the phone anywhere.Anyway, after this episode I switched to Apple, which has their problems too, don't think I love everything there, but I got a problem when I had a 3GS, they simply gave me another phone, still working until today ...So, guys, check everything, the phone seems amazing and I can tell you, in terms of operating system customizations I never saw a better Android than HTC, I really really loved, was a shame what happened. Anyway, good luck!",2014年3月31日 在美国审核

The phone itself is very cool!,"It took me about 4 hours to transfer all my apps, accounts and passwords on this sleek looking phone. The phone itself is very nice: white, slim, and stylish. The box it came in looked brand new, but the power adapter was in a used ziplock bag. I am not sure how that could have happened. The phone screen, the battery and the body itself were wrapped nicely in what looked like factory packaging. The back cover of the phone does have an AT&amp;T logo. Once you start up your phone you'll see a bunch of ATT bloadware (but you can disable those apps).I had one issue with the phone though. I am going to post the steps I had to take to get the phone working on Tmobile. There are several reviews saying that this is a locked phone. I don't think it is locked, the settings are set to work for ATT so you have to manually change them. After all the time I spent configuring the phone, it turned out that it was not connecting my my Tmobile data network. To fix the issue I did everything to a T from this post: http://thedroidguy.com/2015/07/how-to-fix-samsung-galaxy-s5-network-mobile-data-wi-fi-problems-108616Which meant I had to MANUALLY type in the APN settings:The settings are as followsName: T-Mobile US LTEAPN: fast.t-mobile.comProxy: &lt;Not set&gt;Port: &lt;Not set&gt;Username: &lt;Not set&gt;Password: &lt;Not set&gt;Server: &lt;Not set&gt;MMSC: http://mms.msg.eng.t-mobile.com/mms/wapencMultimedia message proxy: &lt;Not set&gt;Multimedia message port: &lt;Not set&gt;MCC: 310MNC: 260Authentication type: NoneAPN type: default, mms, suplAPN protocol: IPv4/IPv6APN roaming protocol: IPv4Turn APN on/off: APN turned onBearer: UnspecifiedMobile virtual network operator type: NoneMobile virtual network operator value: &lt;Not set&gt;Once everything has been setTap the Menu key in the top right.Tap Save.Tap the desired APN profile you want to use.

Carrier data network does not work to work on the default setting.Hope this tip helps some of you who think it's a locked in phone to ATT.",2015年12月9日 在美国审核
Awesome Samsung Galaxy S5 for AT&amp;T,"Thank you,thank you,thank you for finally exceeding my expectations over a phone,and thank you to seller for sending me exactly what I ordered,in pristine condition.This is my 10th Galaxy,in successive order,and by far the best in the lineup.First day,so far,so good.I am not going to repeat all the techie stuff that is already listed,and after uninstalling bloat ware,doing a system upgrade and installing some of my go to apps,I am still working my way though the various functions.A big bonus that this phone has a full bar more phone signal...And I can do group calling. It also came with a screen protector already ""installed""... Just had to peel off the AT&amp;T logo film.Very pleased so far 😌.Update 5.3.2016: The white back plate has cracked on the bottom\both sides of the charger port. I have never had this happening to any other phone before, and Idon't understand how this is possible as the phone is always in a protective silicone cover. The cover seems to be a more porous material, and I expect that it's brittle. The only explanation I can think of is that simply removing and placing the cover back on is damaging it, which is definitely a flaw and should be covered by some kind of warranty. It does not seem possible to contact seller, so will try Samsung directly.",2016年2月4日 在美国审核
Great 4K video Camera Phone,"Galaxy S5 is an outdated model when I bought it in 09/2017. Galaxy phones are now at S8 or higher, with price to match. This S5 is under $200!Phones have become everyone's main camera, nobody lugs around a 2 lb Nikon everywhere.I bought this mainly for the 4K video camera.Under good lighting, video is comparable to a $800 Sony 4k camcorder, i.e. standard 4k brilliance.For still photos, it's a 16 mp camera w/ 16x9 default aspect ratio, also brilliant in good lighting.Now everything I record, video and stills, are 16x9 standardized for editing, filling a TV completely.For video use, if you zoom in at all, it's no longer 4k, because it's not optical zoom.It's digital zoom, which is like cropping the outside to look like you are zooming in.Use only the max wide angle shot for 4k resolution.Same for still photos.Note that for Android phones, 4k recording has a segment length limit of 5 min.If you want to record a full basketball game, you need to press the start button every 5 min.But for everyday use, the 5 min limit is not a problem.Later Galaxy models may have a longer time limit.As to regular phone, internet, &amp; other functions, I only need the basics, and they are more than adequate.There's really no reason to buy a $800 iPhone which can't do 4k, or take photos in 16x9.Unless you want an Apple for stupid bragging rights.This camera/phone is truly a bargain at under $200.",2017年10月27日 在美国审核
Great phone to have,"I got this phone as a replacement for my girlfriend's old phone and it works as expected and looks like new. I had to send back the first one I received because of a camera sensor issue that, after some research, is a problem with some Galaxy S5's. The seller was easy to work with and they sent it within a week. The original phone came with a wall charger and USB 3.0 cable and replacement phone came with that as well as the Samsung earbuds. It was easy to put on her new network (T-Mobile) since it is unlocked and the only problem is that updating the phone's firmware is harder because it is an AT&amp;T phone on T-Mobile's network so upgrading it is more technical. The water resistance hasn't been tested yet so I can't say anything about that, but I will update if it ever does happen. Overall, great phone with a great price and my girlfriend and I are happy customers :).",2016年2月8日 在美国审核

Beware of buying electronics from BlueTekUSA. Would put the review under their name but for some reason I don't see the option!!,"Well I bought two of these phones from a seller called BlueTekUSA but they were Fulfilled by Amazon. One of them has been awful since it arrived. When it was first turned on my wife told me she thinks someone had the phone before but never made a thing of it. After that the phone started lagging and she doesn't do much with it. she tried deleting apps and all sorts of stuff but that never helped. Shortly after the overheating and freezing started. Then the lagging go worst. Now only but maybe four days ago the cover for the charging port just fell of for no apparent reason. She was sitting there and noticed it needed charging and when opening the cover it fell in her lap though! As if that wasn't enough two days after that the screen has now gone completely black and is not responsive to any touch. Ridiculous! Customer Service was awesome though it wasn't their fault. When I thought the nightmare was over as they resolved it by allowing me to return that phone, we now find out two days later that the other one we purchased from BlueTekUSA can't read memory cards. I purchased two new memory cards for a new phone we ordered which was the same Samsung Galaxy s5 as we like the phone and have concluded that the seller BlueTekUSA is very sketchy and unscrupulous. I put the card in the other phone we bought from BlueTekUSA and the phone would not recognize it. I tried restarting the phone, insert the card again. My laptop recognizes it. I tried two other phones that recognized it. I tried formatting the sd card that didn't work either. I was so taken grief stricken as we paid almost $700 dollars for both these phones. When it really struck me that this seller was possibly up to no good was when I looked at the back of both phones where that sd card slots are and realized that the phone that doesn't recognize the sd card had a funny looking sd card slot. It had no serial number but the other faulty phone with the screen gone has and that phone recognized that sd card (I checked that on my PC using Samsung Kies 3). It seemed as if both phones were sold before and returned for similar issues and this seller sold them as new. #Frustrating #Hurtful #Annoying. When this thought occurred I went into retrospect and remembered that when we were buying the phones initially we had seem a review from someone saying this seller is sending out phones as new that were already used and had issues but we weren't sure because the review had seemed like it was more about the product and we weren't 100% sure it was that seller BlueTekUSA. Well much to our surprise (my wife and I) we found out the hard way.",2016年6月19日 在美国审核

It works great with T-mobile,"I have T-mobile, and this phone is unlocked for AT&amp;T. So what? It works great with T-mobile! I did have to take a trip to the store to pick up a new sim card, cause my old one was too big (could have cut it, but I've got a free sim, so...).Other than that, I must say... I spent 3 days researching different phone models, and this one suited all my needs very well. I chose it over Motorolla Maxx (international) not only because of the US warranty and brand name, but also because of the better and easier to choose protective case options. Performance and price wise they are about the same (think about it as Intel and AMD or Canon and Nikon thing).Update: the phone was used, even more so - refurbished. I took it to the shop after I've dropped it (yes, my bad, but it didn't brake or anything, the screen stopped displaying, though), and when the tech opened it to re-connect the screen bus wire (got unplugged?) he showed me the back of the screen with fat fingerprints on the back of it, and told me ""just so you are aware, the screen was replaced before"". Nice. I took it to the seller (Top10Cell, same as TechDeals USA), they agreed to RMA it within a week, so I've sent it in. A MONTH LATER I've contacted Amazon to help me get this issue resolved, as the seller stopped responding to my weekly inquiries on the RMA status. To Amazon's credit they offered a full refund, but I couldn't accept that after month of waiting and $7 shipping cost. Magically the seller responded back right after with tracking number of the NEW replacement unit. So... I've taken down 2 stars of my 5-star original review: one star for a month of waiting, one star for the fact that I had to go an buy another phone while I was waiting, so I'm going to replace my wife's phone with this long awaited one...Update. Ok.... a day after ""new"" replacement arrived my wife told me she has to press hard on the ""go back"" input (bottom right corner). I tried it, and didn't notice anything (having a BRAND NEW non-at&amp;t-but-factory-unlocked-for-more-money-from-another-seller 2nd Galaxy s5 phone helps to compare this stuff), so I said to her it was just fine. However this morning I've ran into exactly the problem she complained about: I had to press hard to ""go back"". And when I did, I've noticed that the corner of the screen ""gives way"" when I press it down, because it's not glued well, it came loose, and I can feel that when I press it gently. With a little pressure it ""sticks"" back in place, than loosens up again, and... WHY???!!! WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE ME???!! Anyways, I've contacted the seller (I'm sure they were happy about that), and I'm working with the seller to find a solution. I don't hate this... situation, but I surely don't like it. Amazon should carry better consumers protection for this kind of purchases, especially when it fulfills the order for the seller. And I totally hate AT&amp;T!!!! This is absolutely their fault, because seller is just as much screwed with those faulty AT&amp;T unlock phones as I am!!!! I've got myself a factory unlocked phone... should I even mention how much more superior it is over this junk on every level including packaging??",2016年5月4日 在美国审核

I love my black Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A!,"I absolutely love my refurbished phone! My husband and I were skeptical about buying a refurb online from a random seller. Just do your research and talk with customer service if you have questions. My phone came from the seller ThrifyComputer and customer service was prompt to my questions. I ordered the white, because we didn't see the options for the black Galaxy until the next day. (Which I actually wanted the black one). Well, I ended up receiving a black one which I was so happy about, because I wasn't going to try to return the white one when I received it, so I guess I got lucky. It looked almost PERFECT! There were just teeny tiny light scratches on the sides of the phone, but hardly noticeable. I didn't even see them until I took it into AT&amp;T to have them check it out and make sure it was fine. They were the ones who spotted the microscopic scratches. The face was perfect! No scratches whatsoever. Honestly, this phone looked brand new to me. I absolutely love it so far. It's only been a few weeks since I've had it. So far, so good. It only came with a charger, battery, and phone.

The tracking was ridiculous, it took multiple days to arrive in my city whennit was an hour away. Also love the fact Amazon left a message on this app stating an apology for my late package and that they were gonna get it back on track. It wasnt Amazon that trasnported it weird but I appreciated that message!Anyways, I am using this phone right now and it works great so far. The speaker works the screen is mostly good it has a small chip in it but hey, it was used and the outside doesn't really matter. The cameras work, but it doesn't have the best quality but its decent. Also, it was super easy to make this phone unlocked and it came with instructions and i love that.",2018年5月2日 在美国审核

I did not realize that the S5 G900A is dedicated to the AT&amp;T network and that it wasn't possible to switch to Verizon.

"Good phone, much like any other Galaxy S5, CHECK for cellphone company and 4G compatibility before buying","Packaging, delivery and product were great.The phone is the same as the one you get in retail and has the same pros and cons as any Samsung Galaxy S5 reviews will tell you. BEWARE of the cellphone company and 4G compatibility though, particularly if you travel internationally. This phone is primarily designed for US cellphone towers (AT&amp;T). It is 4G compatible in US and Europe but not all Asian countries (correct me if I am wrong). I travek to India often and I know it only connects to 3G in India. While I am in US though, it connects to 4G.Great camera, not so great front camera,good speakers and Bluetooth. The Android 6 update made it slower and the battery isn't too great. Love the fact that it has microUSB, replacable SIM card and battery though. Check out literally any review of Galaxy S5 for more details.",2016年6月27日 在美国审核

The Real Deal,"This is indeed what I ordered. My brother was skeptical and thought it might be one of those Samsung knock offs or refurbished. You can rest assured that it is a brand new Galaxy S5 in it's original packaging. It appears to have all the features that it should, including the fingerprint scanner and includes earphones and USB 3.0 charger. So far, it works great. The battery typically lasts one to two days of moderate use without charging and charges quickly with the provided charger. There' s no issues with the camera or phone freezing yet, but will update if something does go wrong.",2016年3月21日 在美国审核

Absolutely Amazing Phone...,"I purchased this S5 upgrading from a S2 (had several debates with myself before making this decision because my S2 is still an amazing phone as well). I was worried the S5 would not stand up to the S2 but... Absolutely awesome phone. I am glad I won the debate with me and myself. I only have to charge the battery a couple of times a week, which is great for as much as I use it. I am always texting with my sister and we talk every day for about three or four hours since she lives a 17 hour flight away. I check my emails several times a day. Always using the internet and still the battery is the best I have ever had on any phone. The S2 has a pretty decent battery life but the S5 is a big improvement on battery life. I have the S5 4g LTE and it is lightening fast. I love the fact I can upgrade the SD card to 128G. I store everything that can be stored to the SD card. This keeps your phone fast and working in top shape. The phone is very user friendly, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to use it. 10 thumbs up to Samsung, you have an absolutely amazing phone. I have a smart TV and I sync my phone to it, and with the remote app that is on the phone I can control my TV and my Dish satellite. If I forget to turn the TV and satellite off, I can push the remote button on my phone and turn it off as I am running out the door. Also takes amazing pictures and videos. I love the HTC feature that allows you to transfer pictures to your fellow S5 users by just touching the backs of your phones together. The sound quality is also great when listening to music, videos or simply talking. BTW - Registering your phone with Samsung is so quick...just go to their website and either set up an account or log in with the account you have tied to your phone fill infew boxes, answer a couple questions and done, simply that easy! Although the S5 is steep in price, it is absolutely worth it!",2014年11月22日 在美国审核

"Be Wary, this Phone Won't Last a Year","I purchased this phone last year for Christmas--not even a full year later, I am being forced to buy a new phone because this one died. At first, it was an OK device. The camera was really good, the sound quality was decent, and performance was also pretty good (very little stutter or lag). A few months in, problems began to arise. The battery life drastically dropped, to the point where it wouldn't last a full day without having to be charged multiple times. The phone would randomly shut off when taking photos or using apps, and it would drop from 100% to 0% when this happened. The battery expanded as well, causing the screen to greatly protrude. Eventually, the screen completely stopped functioning because the battery had become so big. Do yourself a favor, DO NOT purchase this phone unless you plan on purchasing a new one within 6 to 8 months of buying this.",2018年11月28日 在美国审核

We went to AT&amp;T store and realized she still had a 3G SIM and this phone works best with a 4G SIM, so they were able to swap it out for her.Buying this phone saved us over $100 from buying straight from AT&amp;T so I was happy!",2015年1月23日 在美国审核

Awesome Upgrade For An iPhone User (5c) But Buy From Local Retailer Instead.,"I have been an iPhone user since the iPhone 3. I always loved the iPhone but recently became sick of upgrading to the same phone over and over again. All that a new generation I-phone has is 5 new-""not-so-cool"" features with slightly upgraded hardware.First I will tell you why I gave this two stars and then I will review the phone.Not sure that this product (Samsung Galaxy S5 ATT Unlocked Version) was ""Brand New"". It arrived with the box slightly damaged and the headphones appeared slightly different than the factory sealed T-Mobile ones (see pics).The phone also was Dead. On. Arrival. and would not turn on. Not sure if this was an error in the product itself, or because the product was previously used. I was forced to request a return and go to a T-mobile Retail store to buy this phone. Don't make the same mistake as me. Worth the extra $70 plus tax at your local retailer (plus you can get it today, yipee!!).As a phone, I chose to purchase the black version because it was now the same price as the white version (Amazon wants $579.99) for the black version, here (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-G900A-Unlocked-Android/dp/B00K15KRV6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418102700&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=g900a+unlocked).It is very sleek and thin. Feels well made. Right out of the box the first thing I noticed was the screen. Wow! This screen is beautiful. This screen makes virtual seem like reality.I love all the features such as S Health (heart rate monitor), the fingerprint unlock feature, gorilla glass, water-resistance, dust-resistant (or proof, not sure), and gestures. Google and the SmartSwitch app made switching over to the Android world very easy, even as a Mac user. It would be even easier for a PC user.Don't want to take this review too far so I'll sum it up:-Don't buy on here (see pics)-Go buy at local retailer for $70 more (you get it today, no ATT stuff, you are certain it is brand new)-The phone is awesome (5 Stars), definitely buy it (I mean look at all the features!!!)-Easy to switch from I-phone/Mac to S5/Mac.Comment if you have more questions!-Nicholas",2014年12月9日 在美国审核
zero starts very upset! reporting this to Amazon,"Watch out! I wasn't sure at first and only after several months of use am I now sure that this was a used phone which may actually have been refurbished and is now showing issues of an electronic that was refurbished incorrectly. First, the phone looked new. The packaging was convincing but the charging port had a strange part attached to it. The ATT store said they had never seen that before. Also the charging port smelt of cigarette smoke. We don't smoke. Thirdly, I have kept this phone in an otter box case all the time and in an extra case as well. I've had it now for just over six months and have noticed an increasing rate of the following strange things happening: The phone will randomly dial a number without anyone touching the screen or even being near it. It will dial the wrong number when the correct number has clearly been choosen. During all conversations it will beep randomly like someone tried to dial while in mid-call but no one has even touched the phone. I use a bluetooth almost exclusively so my phone is sitting next to me without me touching it. Lately it has started calling people randomly from my contacts and when I try to stop the call it won't respond. I have been told by cell phone repair reps that this is the behavior they most often see if a phone screen has been replaced but not adequately insulated. Over time they say this will continue to get worse until it will be unusable. I paid over 300.00 dollars for a new cell phone! From BREED sellers. They also go by other names as well.

A great cell phone with only a couple of major issues in my opinion.,I like this Samsung galaxy S5 phone that I had recently purchased although it does have a couple of minor but in my opinion a significant manufacturing issues and the most important one being that the camera lens on the back of the phone when I received it had a protective plastic film over the lens which in and of itself is good but using my fingernail I had to really work hard to remove the plastic film and to my horror after doing so I found that just my fingernail ended up scratching the lens in several places and this would not be an issue if Samsung had not tried to save a few pennies by using a cheap plastic lens cover for they should have used a glass lens cover and I have had on my previous cell phone the same kind of glass they use for the screen of the phone for if they did there would be no scratches on it whatsoever and have the lens scratched up before I even took my first picture is extremely upsetting to say the least because one of the top reasons for purchasing this particular model was because of the great camera capabilities but any camera is only as good as the lens and you can have the most expensive camera in the world and if the lens is scratched the photos will not come out very well.,2016年3月20日 在美国审核

"Great phone, but took a while to get all features working","Purchased the phone new, and it works quite well. It is an At&amp;T Samsung phone, which was not mentioned in the Amazon listing. Knocking off one-star b/c I think a primary Amazon listing should mention that.It has At&amp;T logo and software installed as well. I run the phone on T-Mobile, and the phone had to be configured properly so that I could get data and send/receive picture texts.<br>Foe people who expect things to work 100% right out of the box, my experience may give some a second thought. Be aware that T-Mobile (and maybe other service providers as well) do not provide support for these phones, even if your question is about how you get your phone to hook up to THEIR service (for which you are paying). The rep at the T-Mobile store even told me that the phone won't get data or MMS text, and I need to get one of their phones(!) Finally persuaded him to configure the correct APN parameters. This is also available on the T Mobile web site, but takes some digging. Luckily, I have a tech savvy kid to help me out with the process.Great phone, great price, butbe aware that some patience may be required to get up and running.</br>",2015年11月7日 在美国审核

Horrible product,"After deciding to upgrade my IPhone 3, whichserved me well over seven years, I opted for the Galaxy S5. I did a lot of research, read reviews and decided to buy a factory unlocked, refurbished phone. Big disappointment. After just three days, I am sending it back. The phone freezes, locks up and crashes constantly. The fingerprint ID system won't work most of the time. It's just a piece of junk. The most aggravating part is the S5 just freezes/locks up and I can't swipe the screen to even make a phone call. If I had to make an urgent call, I couldn't rely on this phone to even perform that simple task. My old IPhone streams Amazon music via Bluetooth in my car better than the updated Samsung.In spite of all this, I am giving Samsung another try, as I ordered an S4-mini. If that doesn't impress, I'll consider the experiment a failure and happily go back to an IPhone.",2015年9月29日 在美国审核

Poor design leads to poor function,"I bought the phone unlocked to use on the T-Mobile network. It turns out it was originally an ATT phone. Unlike some phones with the same designation (Galaxy S5), this one has a home key in the center at the bottom that is actually a button, It functions as an additional on-button (it won't work to turn the phone off), in addition to the main on/off button on the right side. This button constantly causes the phone to turn on in my pocket, and it beeps and beeps at me as if I had intentionally turned it on and was trying to punch in my pass code. I'm constantly having to pull the phone out of my pocket and turn it off. Given that it was designed for ATT, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it's worse than a pain.

Not A New Device,This was a gift for my son.He likes it but there are several drawbacks.The USB connector for power is non-standard.All other phones use the normal micro-USB.This one doesn't.It's typical Samsung software installed.Tons of bloatware that much of it can't be disabled and constantly uses processor.I would like the device a lot better if there was an option to drop all their junk ware.I love my Nexus devices.The GPS never worked well.It would wander all the time.The previous Galaxy S3 my son had works very well for GPS.I tried to do a return under warranty to Samsung and the device was listed as out of warranty even though I was within the one year period.What Samsung told me was that without the IMEI on the actual receipt they will not do any warranty service.That's right if you buy any Samsung phone from Amazon YOU HAVE NO WARRANTY!Doesn't matter what anyone else tries to tell you.The manager at Samsung warranty repair just gave me the bad news.I am sending the phone to them anyway for $70 and they will let me know if it costs any more to fix it.Sadly they will likely do what I did which was to make sure all the software is up to date and do a hard reset which didn't fix the problem.The moral of the story is if you buy a Samsung device on Amazon make sure you buy an independent warranty otherwise you are out in the cold.Update 12/23/2015:The Samsung repair facility will not work on the device.It apparently has been modified or previously repaired by a third party.The service manager confirmed this device was likely not in a new state when it was sold to me.This sale was fraud.He also said Samsung does not sell phones through third parties like Amazon so you can not guarantee what you are getting.This is a very sad affair.Buyer beware.,2015年12月18日 在美国审核
really loved this phone,"I really, really loved this phone.When I first unboxed it, it was super fast and did everything I needed to (did have to tweak some settings to get data working in the US).Now, within a year of purchase (less 9 months of use), I'm starting to hit a lot of problems.It's quite a bit slower, and the battery life is down to about an hour and a half of active use (apps or internet or phone call), so I have to charge up to three times per day.The screen has come loose, so the phone is no longer usable at a low brightness setting--either flickering screen or flashing green lights and the phone is difficult to wake up from sleep (again flickering screen and flashing green lights).Charging also has become a trial.I must have bumped the charging port sometime in the past couple of weeks, so it only charges if the charger is inserted at exactly the right angle.For context, I'm fairly careful with my cell phone.It's been in a case for most of the time that I've had it and has only been dropped twice, both times onto carpeted surfaces, with a fall from a height of less than four feet.**NOTE: the reason I'm rating this at three stars rather than lower is that I'm definitely a cell-phone over-user.My phone is in use probably 8-12 hours a day.My mom and I purchased this phone at the same time, and so far she hasn't had any problems.She's definitely a cell-phone under-user, but she does travel to Taiwan a lot though, so this phone is great for her, since she can just swap out the sim-card every time she leaves the airport.I'm contacting Samsung to see whether this is still covered under warranty, but my hopes are kind of low since I purchased through an Amazon seller rather than through Samsung directly.I'll update this review with how things go.",2016年10月5日 在美国审核

I do love the amoled screen and the depth of colors. But it comes at a cost of having the annoying lines on your screen. Samsung is supposed to be the biggest rival to apples iPhone. I have an iPhone as my main phone, I've never had any issue like that, AND I've run apples Beta software on it. Samsung has phones blowing up, and the screens that they are so renowned for have these defects.....not good. I definitely should have went with the Xperia for the better android experience. It has a different type of screen, but better camera and is also dust and water resistant.",2016年10月18日 在美国审核

Very decent phone,I have had this phone for about a two months now. I didn't buy this phone from Amazon but from a local retailer. I like to this phone but it do get on my nerves at times. The battery does not last long on this phone. The speaker is in the back of the phone which makes the sound muffled at times. Depending on your apps it gets heated very quickly. I like the fact that I could control my Tv with the built in remote control software. It takes very good pictures but that also depends on your lighten in your background. The finger print unlocking feature sucks. They need to work on that a little more. It gives me hard time recognizing my finger. Maybe they need to have the same kind Apple have installed on their phones. We should have been able to get rid of the unwanted bloatware. Another thing I don't like is that when you download music it goes to the internal storage instead of the micro sd card that I have installed in the phone. I have not figured out how to get it to go to my sd card. I wish I could get the marshmallow update though. Other than that it's a pretty decent phone. Oh! Did I mention it's very lightweight even with the case on.,2016年8月24日 在美国审核

"Great phone, but make sure to verify that it's really unlocked.","I bought my phone from JP Mobiles LLC and thought that it was still carrier locked, i.e. it works fine on the AT&amp;T 4G LTE network, but when a T-Mobile SIM is inserted, the phone throws up an error message and does not connect.HOWEVER, it appears to be an issue with US networks as it works fine on European cellular networks. (See update).As for the other aspects of the phone, it works well and is everything I expected it to be.I actually prefer this model over the new S6.I have a 128 GB memory card in it and it is recognized immediately.It works well with the wireless charging flip cover I use with it.Battery life good, and is a little better than the S4.Due to travel, I have several spare batteries so I usually have a battery around to swap out if needed for all day usage.It accepts both USB 2 and USB 3 microUSB connectors, which is a nice in terms of cable flexibility and data transfer rates.The only complaint I have about the S5 is that the port cover is a little flimsy and sometimes gets in the way of plugging in a charging/data cable.Update May 11, 2015:Although the S5 still does not work with TMobile, I have added another star to my rating because I found that the S5 I bought from JP Mobiles LLC does seem to be unlocked (sort of).I took the S5 to France and was able to use it on the Orange 4G network there. It also worked on the Movistar 4G network in Spain as well, .So there must be some other setting that needs to be adjusted (rather than just getting it unlocked) in order for it to work on a different US based network.",2015年4月2日 在美国审核

Actually I have had my previous phone for almost 4 years and it is still working. Anyway, the touch screen started to stop functioning properly as it was separating. At first, it was not noticeable but eventually it got worse so that I could not even do simple tasks like typing, calling or taking pictures. Also, the screen started to freeze from time to time. Unfortunately nobody took any responsibility. I even sent pictures of how the screen was coming off to Samsung. The customer service told me that they do not consider the screen damage in warranty. I was told that I have to pay for all the expenses if I want to get it fixed. The screen went black and never came on again yesterday. So I guess the phone has to go directly into trash now! I did not even use it for a year!!!My husband has the same phone (he bought it almost a year and a half ago) and has very similar problems with the screen (it goes black randomly and does not come back on for some time).I think this quality and service is not acceptable for what the price is...It's so sad to see that Samsung does not care for losing their customers!",2017年2月3日 在美国审核

Luckily, I've never had any issues with Amazon returns, so though I'm disappointed that I'll have to wait for a new phone, I don't worry that my money will be refunded.The S5 itself seemed very nice.I hadn't seen it in person, just read reviews.The only thing that seemed off-putting was the plastic chrome edge.It seemed much cheaper looking than most Samsung phones.Also - is there a way of knowing what reviews are for which company?I know most of them are fulfilled through Amazon, but I worry about ordering from a company that has many of the same problems (unlocked phones, used, stolen, etc.).",2015年11月4日 在美国审核

Buyer Beware,"I ordered this phone after trying my friend's phone and was impressed with how clear it sounded. This phone came in January 4th, 2016. I am 74 years old, and this was my first experience with a smart phone. I was having some health issues involving my hearing making it difficult to understand anyone on my old phone. I took the phone to Walmart who activated it thru Straight Talk. I was able to use the phone both in making calls and receiving calls. Within a short time I started getting messages on the phone saying it wasn't charging and to make sure the charger was an authorized Samsung charger. This was the charger that came with the phone. Sometimes it would charge to 40% before I would get the message, sometimes 60% before it would quit charging. I took it to a local shop that repairs phones, tablets, computers. They said the phone was defective and I should return it. My visiting grandson who also has a Samsung S5 and works in the IT/Electronics department at his work, tried his charger in my phone, getting the same message. He even tried my charger in his phone andit worked fine. He suggested I return the phone. He said possibly the charger port was damaged and it could be replaced. I took it to another local company and they tried 4 different ports, and still not able to fix it. I decided to just use the phone until it died, which it did within a few days. Finally giving up I contacted Amazon about returning the phone, but the allotted time to return an item had passed. Someone told me to contact Samsung that there is a one year warranty that should be in effect still. I have been unable to find anyway to contact Samsung directly.

Fair Warning - Price too good to be true,"I have had nothing but problems with this phone. It says it was new and unlocked, but I am wondering if it was actually defective but sold as new and with no problems. The first phone I got from this company I had for about 33 days (just over the warranty) and I woke up one morning and had no service and the phone kept turning off and on. It said that I had no SIM card inserted yet I did. It also kept turning off and on therefore killing the battery. So I would turn the phone off and it would immediately turn back on. It would not even stay off let alone on so it was essentially worthless. I got in touch with the seller and the customer service was great though, even though it was past 30 days he issued me a refund and I was able to get the same phone again. I thought maybe the SIM card had fried the phone so I decided to give the S5 another shot- not a good idea. I have gone through yet another SIM card with this phone but it did not destroy the phone this time around. It hardly ever vibrates even when set on that mode, I never get notifications for voicemails even though I should and some times it doesn't even ring when someone is calling even when I have service. Then when I do get a call I often cannot answer. I swipe the green button repeatedly to answer the call yet it keeps ringing and I end up missing the call. The camera is terrible also. The colors are off and it's very hard to get it to focus. Lately, it will not even stay connected to my email account. So I unconnected my email and then tried to link it again and it would not even work. This phone also does not stay connected to WiFi no matter how strong it is. I know this is long but I want others to know what you could potentially be getting with this seller. After having two phones that had issues with them I'm not convinced that they're legit.",2016年8月27日 在美国审核

"Refurbished product, labeled and sold as ""new""","I have noticed that some of the critical reviewers have stated that they received refurbished products or products in poor condition. Bless their little hearts, they weren't very eloquent or detailed about it, but the warning was there. I bought this product supposedly brand new-- it even says brand new on the label-- but what I received was most certainly a refurbished product.When I unboxed the phone, there were no obvious, tell-tale signs of tampering. Everything *appeared* to be factory sealed and in proper new condition. However, upon activating my device I encountered several problems-- calls either couldn't be placed (""emergency calls only"" message), or would appear to ring on my end but not actually go through, or more commonly, drop immediately after being answered; the data connection could not be accessed at all; and the GPS could not connect. The SIM card I used with this was seated correctly, undamaged, activated properly, and was recognized by the phone; and after much investigation the issue did not seem to be the SIM card or my carrier. Since GPS service functions independently and has nothing to do with the phone carrier, I began to suspect that there was hardware damage or else corrupt firmware. My partner and I inspected more closely.The first sign of use that caught our eye was the screws; the inner corners were worn and not sharp, evidence of wear by a screwdriver. The screen also did not sit flush in the bottom right corner and can be pressed down about a millimeter or so but would not stay in place. The last and most damning sign of wear was crud around the camera frame; there was not a lot, but it appeared to be either pocket crud or rust. In either case, this should not be present on a new product.I realize that these concerns are specific to the seller and not to the product itself; however, you should heed this warning if you are considering buying the product from this listing. I will also be leaving a review of the seller, but because there is a rather strict 400-character limit, I cannot go into as much detail as I can here. Please proceed with caution and should you choose to buy your new phone from this listing, have a high index of suspicion and scrutinize it carefully until you are confident that you have received what you intended to purchase. Most sellers are probably selling with integrity.And yes, this could have been a labeling/clerical error; I have extended the benefit of the doubt to another seller when a similar scenario occurred in the past. But after reading the other reviews claiming to have received refurbished merchandise, I am feeling somewhat less forgiving. Fraud or error? Either way, sellers are accountable for the condition of their merchandise. Buyer beware.",2016年7月21日 在美国审核

Battery swelled up and broke the phone apart.,Beware of this phone. After about 4 months of normal use the Samsung battery swelled up and pressed against the body of the phone with such force the screen glass has lifted away from the frame of the phone. I assume there was some strong chemical reaction inside the battery and happily at least no one was hurt or burned. By web search I see this is not that uncommon with the S5 battery. The return period is only 2 months so now I am stuck with a $300 piece of junk.,2016年5月24日 在美国审核

We couldn't be more pleased with BlutekUSA and they get 5 stars,"The most important 1st comment any reviewer can make is who is supplying your part to Amazon!Without this info 1st all else is irrelevant as Amazon continually changes suppliers, sometimes daily. I for one tend to ignore reviews without this info. Please don't bother providing a review without this very important info 1st.As for our Unlocked Galaxy S5 purchase, it was supplied by “BlutekUSA.”After reading so many reviews of people getting locked phones, used phones, refurb phones &amp; other network incompatibilities by other or unknown suppliers, etc... We decided to email BlutekUSA directly asking them who unlocks the phone, is it new, never used, never activated or refurb?Does it have 3G &amp; 4G &amp; (LTE) on ALL the OTHER GSM networks?And no restocking fee if this phone is returned for not meeting above claims. They replied in writing within 36 hrs.Their Unlocked S5 is NEW, not a used or refurb and it is supplied by a professional unlocking supplier in brand new original sealed packaging!Not a scratch one!No restocking return fee if it is not as advertised.All we needed was the precise APN settings from our GSM phone carrier and we did indeed receive 3G, 4G &amp; LTE as the different towers did support in different areas. Our carrier is Consumer Cellular. All other advertised claims were true!We couldn't be more pleased with BlutekUSA and they get 5 stars!Ordered on Tues, received it that Friday with standard free shipping!I won't go into a lot of other details that are already provided by many other website technical reviews.Just have these few added comments below:Very important PRO's for me were:REMOVABLE BATTERY! -*Please pay attention manufacturer's!SHC/SDXC/SD Card slot to 128 GB -* Please pay attention manufacturer's!Water resistant.*APPs that can be turned off that insist on sharing all your info with AT&amp;T, Samsung, Google &amp; the Cloud!Some of us don't have multiple computers or enough data service to support these features.Not having an overly huge screen! -* Please pay attention manufacturer's (5.1” is almost too big)!Best Music player I have ever seen!Album art not jumbled here and there + it has folder view!!!!Fantastic camera &amp; video (better than my own stand alone's).So customizable!Lookout anti-malware.More customizable settings on everything of any phone I've ever seen.Had over 9.8 GB free on the internal memory.Has a document file cabinet.Stand alone APPs that don't require the internet to work! - *Please pay attention APP developers!Some very minor disappointments:Just doing inputs, settings, data loads, contacts etc.... Battery went down to 46% in 3 hrs.Music speaker sound quality could use just a little improvement.Peel Smart remote control APP didn't work on our 2012 LG 3D Smart TV or Satellite.Don't know how to reverse an APP that I “Forced Stop”How to undo a Forced Stop?Couldn't get the 32GB version that I preferred. Good thing I'M not an APP-O-Holic &amp; have a sd card!NUETRAL - 388 Total phone system APP's,about 45 are screen icons.This is really a great phone overall and supplied by BlutekUSA, a better supplier @ roughly $340 for 16GB version.The cell phone was tested for tower signal strength side by side with a Moto G EXT.Signal strength was very close, maybe just a bar less on the S5 at times.The phone feels &amp; looks well constructed (&amp; I'm very picky).Don't think you can really go wrong with this phone unless you do prefer the cheaper sealed battery yearly throw away type phones with no SD ext memory slots?Otherwise your search should be over!",2015年12月21日 在美国审核

Best Phone I've Owned,"This is the best smartphone I've ever owned.I am replacing a Nokia that was not a bad phone, but there were too many apps not available for the Windows system. Since this Samsung is an android, I no longer have that problem.I'm also thrilled with how easy it was to set up. So intuitive! Everything worked great right out of the box, which is not an experience I've had in the past.I love the display, and I also like that the phone is expandable.So far, the only problem I've had is a driver issue. Although I have Windows 10 on my PC, I am unable to get into the files to add music, podcasts, etc. It appears that Samsung has not issued a Windows 10 driver for this phone which seems strange and forces me to have to find a workaround until the issue is fixed.Despite the driver issue, I am thrilled with this phone.

I'M NOT DRIVING!,"The S5 wants you to be safe. It has this horriblefeature called car mode. When in this mode it will reject calls and texts so you will not be distracted while driving. Car Mode activates any time this phone is paired with any Bluetooth divice.I have a smart watch, therefore, I am always in car mode.You can select ""I'm not driving""from the menu.This works for about 10 minutes.The app cannot be disabled. If you do a forced stop, it will just start up again. You cannot uninstall it.I've called Samsung and taken it to the Verizon store. I've often screamed OMG I'M NOT (explative) DRIVING!!Nothing works. At least I can turn off the auto reply. It kept sending messages to my boss that I was driving when I should have been in the office. Now it just announces to my coworkers that I'm receiving a personal call and the name of the caller.I wonder how many lives have been saved by blocking calls for a person sitting in their cubicle. My chair has wheels but I'm not going to crash into a filing cabinet and die. When I'm driving, the hands free functions in my car compete with car mode so that neither works. I am not able to use any voice activated functions when I am driving because of car mode. I'm going back to a Motorola phone first chance I get.Moto Assist operates smoothly with my car.It uses GPS to detect when I'm driving and allows me to easily operate everything hand free.

A Little Work Samsung,I brought this phone from T-Mobile August 2014. It was a great phone at first but after a few updates and months it became a lagging piece of crap and would not function as it was when new. I contacted T mobile and got a new one and I'm glad I did because it appears to have been defected. This phone has a 16 MP camera that in great lighting conditions can take excellent photos to win Instagram wars or Tumblr wars. From customizing fonts to lock screen patterns and animations this phone can do a lot more than an iPhone. The front camera also is grainy in low lighting its just horrible. The finger print sensor is a OK its not as good as the 5s but its not a gimmick either. The screen is still one of the best in 2016 As it has more pixels per inch then the iPhone 6S Plus (2015) smartphone.

A Samsung Evolution,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT &amp; SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the ""natural"" setting, as the ""vivid"" and even ""standard"" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the ""back"" and ""menu"" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59"" x 2.85"" x 0.32""(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury ""F"" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and ""Google Street View"" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.",2014年5月1日 在美国审核

A Great Phone for a Great Price,"I've had this phone for almost a week, and I have been very impressed since then.For the price, this is an outstanding phone.Pros:----------Call quality is just fineGreat processing speedGreat camera qualityIncredible battery life (with constant use and Wi-Fi on, I only charge about once every 24 hours)Dedicated Back, Home, and Menu keys at the bottomSpeakerphone can achieve a relatively high volumeWi-Fi and Data are quickly established upon activationIt also has lots of little features not mentioned here that I appreciate.Some of them include:The ability to take screenshots while watching a videoPinch-zooming in on the home screen allows you to view the background, free of appsEntering a knock-code while the phone is locked and the screen is off will still unlock the phoneCons:----------When I was first activating this phone (Boost Mobile), a Google prompt consistently popped up asking for my location.It was quite consistent!I had to click Decline about thirty times.However, it hasn't returned since.There are in fact two speaker grilles on the bottom of the phone, only one of which is functional.Hardly a deal-breaker for me.It is a rather slippery phone; I recommend the complementary purchase of a case.I haven't dropped it yet, but you never know.There is a moderate amount of bloatware, the majority of which are additional Boost apps.It didn't take me long to uninstall them.Conclusion (TL;DR)------------------------------The LG Volt is an amazing phone, and very modestly priced.If you are on a budget, this is the phone for you.Even if you can afford to spend twice or three times as much on a phone, consider saving your money and buying this one.Other than the listed cons (which aren't even very demonizing anyway), I really have nothing bad to say about this phone.",2015年1月16日 在美国审核
Save yourself the headache!!!!,"At first, I adored this phone! Fast, reliable, no issues...Now?

The rear camera does a decent job for texting pics and it takes better video than I expected.With the included USB cord, it synced right up to my Windows 7 laptop without downloading any software or drivers. Easy to transfer pics and files.The battery wasn't lasting a full day until I disabled/uninstalled all the useless apps I don't use or want.

"Good phone, good price, but small drawbacks","December 19th 2014: This is the best phone I've had yet. Supports all my games beautifully with no lag and I love how I can answer texts in-game. Yet there's a few downsides, but nothing too inflicting. The speakers arent that good, but this can be remedied with headphones. Also with how boost's service is I'm constantly getting 1-2 bars where I live.UPDATE (3.23.2015)So I've had the phone for three months now. One of the three months the screen was broke and I was using another phone, but I ended up fixing this one just because it was so awesome. Its still the amazing tank of a phone that it was before. I've grown to become ignorant to the lacking quality in the speakers and the signal is still ""eh"" but again I've grown used to it. My texts still send, my calls are made, and data works everywhere I go so I haven't really any reason to change carriers.

A really great upgrade at a lower price than the other phones.,"I bought this phone to replace the HTC One SV on I have had for the past year+. While I liked the HTC One SV I really like this one a lot better. A bigger screen without being toto big. Nice features. A better camera. And when I bought this it was only $67 on Amazon which is much better than the $179 Boost is still selling it for. It's plenty fast to do whatever you want. And for those of you who know what they are (and I suggest you get one) you can get a tempered glass screen protector for this thing which is amazeballs. Really. Get a tempered glass screen protector. Just make sure it's a 9H hardness, has rounded edges and an oleophobic surface and you will be glad you did.

FOR THIS PRICE.....5 STARS!!,I must say I really do like this phone. I upgraded from the Moto G which was 3G and I noticed the difference immediately. So for those who are considering going from a 3G phone to a 4G this is a good choice. My review is based on not having used a 4G phone before. I use Pandora in my car with the phone and the connection is much faster and clearer. Also my calls I can hear clearer than my prior phone. I like how the control buttons are set up on both sides. Also it has the double tap to turn on the screen which is nice. Quite a few nice ringtones to use also. The only downfall for me (but not enough to not give 5 stars) is the location of the speaker on the bottom of the phone. It just took getting used to just as when switching to any phone. But the biggest upside is the price! This phone is priced much higher on Boost. For the price you are getting a lot of phone. I also ordered the Aero Armour case to go with it which fits well.,2014年12月10日 在美国审核

The LG VOLT is a highly underrated phone.,For the price I payed for it ($80 on Amazon) It is amazingly loaded with features.I got the Boost Mobile version of the phone. I was with Virgin Mobile and they too have the LG VOLT.The Boost Mobile was cheaper to buy and their plans were cheaper per month as well so i switched from virgin mobile to Boost it was very easy to do since they are both a Sprint pay per month service you just have to call and activate the Phone and ask to be sent to the migration department to switch your phone over. Word of caution what ever number you a switching over do not use that phone to call in it will be disconnected instantly when the migrate from virgin mobile to boost mobile.The phone itself is very easy to use with a quad processor. It does quite well with any app i have thrown at it. The battery seems to last for days with moderate use. I'd say about 2.25 days without charging.It's about the size of a Galaxy S III.There is not alot of preinstalled Apps that you have to get rid of like on my previous phone.

Pretty good phone for the price,"Pretty good phone for the price! I compare it to the Galaxy S2 a lot, it seems about the same just for a lower price. I don't even use it as a“phone"", I use it as a WiFi tablet and its better than the Nook I used to have from Barnes And Noble. Its pretty fast on WiFi. Storage was a bit of an issue, but I bought a 32 GB micro SD card and it took care of that. If you're looking for a nice, easy to use smartphone without spending $200 this is your best bet. Cameras aren't “the best”, but the front facing camera is pretty good for selfies. The back camera is decent too, I'm an amateur model and know when a camera is good or not. For the price, these cameras go above and beyond. Battery life is good too! It usually lasts me all day and into the night with moderate use. And here's a tip: if your phone starts “messing up”, its usually the battery. I already checked, and a replacement battery for this phone is just over $20 on Amazon. Pretty good price if you ask me. Better than buying a brand new phone. I've dropped my volt a couple times accidentally (from about 3 feet) and it still works perfectly, no cracks in the screen either. My advice? You should buy this phone. The bad reviews are most likely from people who get lemons.",2015年5月16日 在美国审核

LG Volt is amazing!,"The Lg volt is the perfect phone for everyday use. I downloaded the dodol launcher application to make themes and backgrounds look similar to android Lollipop this has slowed my phone down a lot but more due to the app then the phone. The volt has an amazing 8mp back camera that takes amazing photos for the price, 1080p HD video is also great on the volt, the front facing camera is very poor so if your looking to take HD selfies this is not your phone. Boost Mobiles service is great too phone calls are nice and crisp and data speeds are reasonable fast, there are also a lot of cheap resonable data plans to choose from. My complaints for this phone are minimal were the times were apps crash and my phone may turn off &amp; the 4gb internal memory kinda sucks, other than that this a perfect phone for the price and one of the very best budget phones on the market. If your expecting to just txt, call, social media and a few games this phone is the phone for you if you expect to do heavy gaming this not the phone for you.",2015年4月14日 在美国审核
The LG Volt Throws Perfect Strikes!,"I'm really enjoying my new Android phone! I had a touch phone 7 or 8 years ago that I only used for two months; then I gave it to my daughter because I couldn't do without my traditional push button phone. But now that technology has advanced so much, I didn't know what I was missing! This is my FIRST Android cell phone! Getting around on my Volt is so smooth and easy it's practically flawless! The battery life is decent, and the sound from the internal speakers is pretty good too. The features are excellent! I took a lot of time making the decision to purchase the LG Volt, and I can't think of a better cell phone in the price range that I paid.

The camera is decent and for how much I paid for it I was easily able to get protective covering and case for it for an extra 5 dollars. The only downside is I am noticing it's starting to lag a little bit even with the extra 32 gb SD card I added to it. It dowloads all apps and pictures and musicto internal storage but there is a memory managers so you can transfer all of that to SD through that and the apps the the android OS system settings in the app management. Also has great battery life. I was considering getting a used Galaxy 3 but this honestly comes extremely close and it comes brand new at a cost of very slight lower resolution. I used both phones and I honestly didn't even notice the difference Until I looked extremely close to the screen.

Great phone,"I bought this phone twice. It has great reviews for a reason. It's easy to navigate and works well. Battery lasts forever (assuming you don't run a thousand apps). At this point, the camera is getting a bit outdated. That's actually why I bought the second one, becuase I thought the camera was starting to take crappy pictures. Turns out, it just looks that way compared to all the really high quality cameras on newer phones. I really can't complain though - I spent about 60 bucks twice, and for what I paid, I really can't say I could do better.

Another family member has the LG L90 which for the money can be bought in the same price range and is essentially the same phone however the volt has a much better rear camera, 8mp vs 5mg, a bigger battery at 3000v vs approx 2200 and the best feature the LED notification home button. This very convenient and customization feature allows you to set colors for different apps and or contacts, the whole home button's outer edge lights up for a very nice effect.The only down side to this phone especially when compared to its lesser twin the L90 is the wireless provider but again if you live in an area where boost operates this is single handily the best phone for the money.",2015年2月7日 在美国审核

Great switch from my old Galaxy 3,Love this phone it has exactly and more then my galaxy 3. I had to get it for battery reasons because I drain batteries extremely fast. Ive had this phone maybe 2 weeks. But it feels like I always have. Anyone from a small child to an adult can use it. This is an amazing phone for a great prize. Love the sound its really loud even though some people say it isnt. Which they are lieying to you about. Especially the led being the home button makes it cooler. I love showing that part of because only LG does this. And knock code makes me be all cool when I show it off around my college friends. Everyone seems to envy my awesome phone. If you dont know about getting one buy one already you wont regret it. Only down side is ram but idk how much ram youd need. Its suppose to have 8gs of stored data but only has like 4. Just buy an SD card if you need it. I dont but thats because i save everything on google +. Seriously much better phone then the $600 iphones out there. Does more and not even over $100 unless you buy through virgin or boost. This version is black not white like virgin mobiles is. Still get a case for it because its such a cool phone. Youll waste maybe 85 dollars total while you could spend hundreds on a phone that does less and will break.,2014年10月7日 在美国审核

Excellent prepaid phone!,"Just switched back to android from Windows Phone and this is a very quick little phone. I've had a few little glitches here and there and one time where it froze and I had to remove the battery to restart it. Other than those occasional problems its worked great. I'm a pretty heavy duty data user and my Nokia 520 with only 512GB of memory just couldn't handle it. I had web pages just closing randomly in the middle of articles which is very frustrating. No such problem with this Volt tho.I am a little dissapointed in the camera -I thought going from 5 to 8 MB's would be a great improvement, but its just so so. But really what can you expect from a $70 phone?All in all I'm really satisfied with this phone (after about a month of use) and would recommend it to others.

Fabulous Low Cost Alternative!,"I was able to get the LG Volt activated on the very cost savings TING network about a month ago! I purchased mine here on Amazon for $60 as a Boost Mobile unit. It did not require a micro SIM card. There was some problem getting it to register at first because some stupid popup kept popping up right after turning it on, but after a few tries I was able to do it! I think the key was to register the ID Number with Ting asap.I was also able to port over my number from my older Galaxy S3, no problem!This phone so far has worked great and I saved money because the Galaxy S3 needed to have the cracked screen replaced and so that might have cost $150! I also saved a ton of money in not having to get a newer Galaxy or Nexus 5! I was going to get a Moto G, but that has no expansion card and is also only 3G not 4G wireless, so it would not be as fast. I am recently retired and so the LG Volt is a perfect Android phone for me. No insurance required either because if something happens to it, I just replace it for $60 bucks!So if you are currently a Sprint customer this phone will allow you to port your number over to TING whichs runs on the Sprint Network as does Boost and then get this phone activated. My current bill is between $24 - $31/month where before while on contract with Sprint it was $96/month! Here's a way to check out TING: https://ting.com/account/customer_referral",2015年1月30日 在美国审核
