happy girl.,"i was so scared to order a $600 8 plus off amazon and after reading some of the reviews it made me a lil more scared. i just got my phone in the mail today and it came in a nice little assorted box with a charger and everything. i took the phone out it already had a screen protector on so that was a plus, i cut it on and activated it with no problem, and so far it’s working perfectly fine, just like new. so far so great :) thank you buyspry or however u spell it lol ",2019年1月8日 在美国审核
100/5!,"i always buy my phones on amazon. it's always cheaper and more convenient. i have since upgraded to the xs max, but i loved this phone when i had it. there were absolutely no flaws when i received it (cracks, dents, scratches, etc). it looked and operated like a brand new iphone. all of the switches, touch id, cameras, etc worked perfectly fine. i used this with straight talk and had no issues putting my sim card in and getting signal.one thing to note is that you will have to buy your own headphone adapter (they're about $9 on apple's website) if you don't have airpods/wireless headphones since the headphone jack is now gone. the package only included a white box, the phone in protective films, a couple of info papers, and a charger.overall, i'm extremely happy with my purchase and i will buy again if the time arises.",2018年9月12日 在美国审核

Perfect 4.7  (**4 UPDATE IN DESCRIPTION**),"Honestly, I was a little hesitant/skeptic about buying a device let alone a smart device on Amazon especially cuz it said something about 1897 in the title of the name. It was supposed to come around 8pm but arrived 7 hours earlier. No scratches. Came with 99% battery capacity. Surprisingly it’s actually an apple device lmao, and it works with Metro PCS. Only thing is Idk about everyone else but I would say it’s more of a cream color than a gold, and my only concern is, it’s rebooted/restarted (turned off then back on) randomly twice since I got it not sure what it means cuz I don’t think it’s stuck in a boot loop because it’s up-to-date on all updates, but maybe it was nothing ♂ Idk lol but overall I’d say 5/5 MMMAYBE 4.5 lmao<br>(SC/IG; Sp3ctre.Wolf)UPDATE: 3 stars(if not 2.7♂)Yhhh so it'll be a week that I've had this now by tomorrow. But everytime I try and use the camera now through the original software (say for portrait mode, slow mo, video, etc or even open the app at all for that matter) it reboots, like every single time- to the point to where I'm contemplating why this is even a thing. Idk if I should return it, bring it in for a diagnosis or what, but if anyone can help me with this please let me know, ♂ Thanks in advance (COULD) be the recent update “bootloop”)*UPDATE UPDATE* 2 weeks after purchaseSo it would turn out that it WAS the phone (apple) and not the seller (obviously) because of the recent 12.4 update♂. I was experimenting with different settings, to see what could’ve triggered it until I tried force rebooting the phone consecutively until I thought it had enough lol. So far I think it’s fixed but if not, ig I’ll update again ♂ lmao.</br>",2019年8月16日 在美国审核
Nice price but battery life is a little depressing.,Phone came in pristine condition. Not one scratch or ding.

Very surprised in the best way!,"I was hesitant on ordering a new unlocked phone from Amazon but I’m honestly!! I’m glad I did , it really surprised me when it came down to how clean the iphone looked (8Plus) . It didn’t come with a legit iPhone charger but it still came with an alternative. I have plenty of other iPhone chargersso it didn’t bother me I just needed the iphone. Since it was my first time trying this out i thought the iphone I bought wasn’t unlocked at first because when I would put my Metro PCS SIM Card in the SIM card holder of the new phone in the top left corner it would still read [No SIM].So that’s when I took it upon myself to look on YouTube &amp; get down to the reason why , and YouTube was helpful! I figured out that I had to call my phone carrier and let them know I wanted to switch to a new phone using my current SIM Card, and all they needed was basic information from me as far as my account info and also the IMEI # of the new iphone I purchased! &amp; keep in mind there is a fee for switching over that will be added to your next phone bill or right then while talking to a representative , if you have Metro PCS my fee came to $55 &amp; some change..So after that was taken care of I just took my SIM Card out of my old iphone and placed it in the SIM Card holder of the new iphone &amp; next thing I know everything worked out fine! I do recommend that you have all your passwords for your Apple ID /Apps ready along with having your iphone backed up so it will be easy to do a simple transfer I hope this helps someone who’sthinking about purchasing a phone from Amazon!",2020年4月21日 在美国审核

It is locked to AT&amp;T but all I had to do was take the SIM card out of my old AT&amp;T iPhone and put it into this one. I made sure to backup everything to iCloud before I took the sim out and I’m glad I did! I was able to start this phone with no problems and it now is set up identically to my old phone all my photos and apps are here and it looks amazing!! It did however, as I noticed in previous reviews, come with only 10% battery charged and a off brand charger. That didn’t really bother me though because for the price this was 100% worth it!

Happy with the purchase,"My old IPhone 8+ is 4 years old and battery started to die very fast. In addition I had a problem with my screen, since it fell down countless times and only because of protective shield, the glass stayed in place. Lately, I noticed that the screen actually has multiple cracks and I really need to change the screen and the battery. The cost of repair is very high and could be around $300-450, if not more. Also, I was not ready to spent $900 for a new phone, and I love my 8+. So, I decide to buy a refurbished. The package was delivered literally in two days and it's in great condition. The set up and backup upload was easy-peasy. I keep my fingers crossed that this phone would last.

"In 2022, iPhone 8 Plus is still a solid option","Seller: BMOF86ST<br><br>Use YouTube for an actual device review. This entry is for the purchase experience on Amazon.Received phone in 3 days.Scratches on the back especially on the bottom corner— this is the worst part of the review. I have it in a case all the time, so this doesn’t bother me. The outer frame has scratches as well, but again it’s in a case for me. Everywhere else was absolutely fine—- zero cracks, 100% functional. The screen (the most important part) looks brand spanking new. Touch ID is better than FaceID imo. Charger and cable were generic aftermarket, but they work fine. Screen again, looked and felt brand new- either a high quality aftermarket screen or a refurbished oem. It looks great either way. The box was a generic that they probably use for all their used phones. For $220 shipped, this phone is still a great value for those who don’t need all the new stuff. Battery life cycle remaining was 83%- meaning the majority of the battery life capacity was still good.As a basic use smart phone- web browsing, email, watching/streaming videos, music, radio, small games—— it’s fine. Buy it.Review one month later—- device is still fine, battery still strong. I’m happy.</br></br>",2022年5月5日 在美国审核

Took a risk on Amazon Certified Refurbished and SO GLAD WE DID,"Phones are WILDLY, INSANELY expensive and buying new was not an option for us. We both rocked our 5S iPhones until this past Christmas (the Verizon reps were genuinely shocked when we took the new ones in to change over) when it was not possible to keep them functioning (the home button no longer worked, storage was a daily issue, etc). We had never bought Amazon Certified Refurbished before and we are SO glad we took the gamble. They came in perfect condition and have been working perfectly; battery life, functionality, the whole nine. Will update if something goes south, but we're covered under warranty for the first 6 months, so even still we should be ok.

I checked every rating, comparison and cons on this phones outside of the reviews listed in Amazon by other purchasers...this is the top rated back model other the XR in Apples line.

I’ll change it whenever.Other than that, great phone. Love it! Shipping was quicker than was told.

My review of this purchase.,"IP8 Plus works great. I have only had it less than a week. I was a little uneasy spending $450 on a refurbished phone but I did and I am very happy so far and I saved some money buying this refurbished unit as opposed to a brand new iphone.

Great Buy - works on the Comcast System,"I have now had this phone for a month and just wanted to make sure it performed as expected - it does and it exceeded expectations.I had been looking for an iphone8plus for a while and thought the way to go would be to grab one up after Christmas on Craigslist.Craigslist can be a nightmare, but my biggest problem was knowing whether or not an ""unlocked"" phone would work on the Comcast system.There was not too much data out there in regards to this.Comcast piggybacks on Verizon to my understanding, so I thought an unlocked Verizon phone would work, but I was not sure.Short story long, I bought this phone since my wife gave me an Amazon gift card for $100 (it's either that or Home Depot) so that buffered the cost.With the knowledge of a 90 day warranty and confirmation from the seller it would work on Comcast (if not I could return it)I decided to take the plunge.The phone arrived in short order and was well package, and the battery was charged.It looked for all purposes to be branded new.I think that may be the difference between ""renewed' vs ""reconditioned"".Anyway, I slippedthe SIMS card in and everything worked as expected.Not knowing all the advantages going from a 6plus to an 8plus - the new phone told me to place next to the old phone and it downloaded the data in about 3 minutes and everything was there and worked as expected (no wires no nothing).Anyway, I enjoy the phone and went from a phone with 16GB to 256 Gb of memory (what luxury).I would highly recommend buying a phone from the seller.",2020年2月12日 在美国审核

iPhone 8 Plus!!!,The phone came in the mail 2 days late but I don’t think that was the sellers fault - other than that I’m very happy with my purchase! You can’t beat the price. There’s just one little scuff on the right bottom edge but other than that this refurbished phone seems brand new. The phone came completely dead but I don’t really mind that I just charged it - the battery life came at 92% I can’t complain! I think it’s definitely worth buying a refurbished phone over a new one if you’re looking to save money. I felt mostly safe buying this because of the 90 day warranty Amazon Renewed promised. The camera works well I can’t find anything wrong with it so far - if I do I will update my review. Thanks CR Land!,2019年7月31日 在美国审核

At first I thought I was going to be scammed and that I was going to get a smart phone other then the iPhone 8 Plus that I ordered, how ever when it arrived I was really impressed and still is as this is a big upgrade for me as an owner of an iPhone 6. Definitely would say this is worth your money. Also I was impressed because I got an iPhone case for it fir free. Thank you!!! ",2020年10月21日 在美国审核
Love this Iphone 8+,"I was really surprised that it took only a couple of days to receive my Phone 8+.It came with a power supply and cord and looked brand new.I was able to charge it - update it and found all I had to do to set it up was keep it next to the old phone.The new phone popped up with a app asking me if I wanted to transferred all my information and apps from the old phone over to the new phone..To be safe I did save a backup to iCloud - then turned off Icloud and ""Find my phone"" on the old unit.After about 30 minutes the process completed.Then I moved the Sim card over to the new phone and I had service.All in all it was rather painless to upgrade and I did not have to wait in line at the phone store.",2020年11月1日 在美国审核

iPhone 8 Plus (64),"Wow! What a bargain. Purchase price was $400.I took it to an APPLE store and they agreed on the excellence of this product.

great phone,"i know i might not sway your opinion but im just telling you go for it. if you looking for a somewhat new phone this is perfect. i did have issues before since i bought a tmobile locked and i thought ""it should work, sprints tmobile"" but thats not true since when this phone was manufactured that wasnt the case so its locked to actual tmobile ACCOUNTS it doesnt matter if you have a tmobile or sprint sim card. mind you the phone was perfect only a little scratching on the corners of the phone but you cant see that with a phone case anyways. so i returned that phone and got a full refund *including tax* and bought an unlocked phone as tmobile said to do and i havent put my sim in yet but i looked in my settings and its not locked to any sim so it should swim smoothly. again when i bought the phone i got the charger, box, but this time i didnt get a screen protector but i think that varies based on who you buy from. this phones battery health is not as good as the other one but its still above 80% *83* anyways this phone is great so far and yeah would buy again.TL;DR: great phone, no complaints about the phone itself",2021年7月3日 在美国审核

IPhone 8 DECIDE FOR YOURSELF,"I was definitely Skeptical about purchasing a phone off the Internet and I’m a little upset that I did as well.

For the money I paid I’ve only had the phone close to six months and I already can’t hear out of the speaker, The home button vibrates and makes this weird noise which is annoying when opening the phone or even to close a app, The music plays very low and the phone is always freezing and as I stated I only had the phone less than six months. If anything I would say go to store and purchase your phone that way you know your getting a good refurbished phone that can be fixed or replaced if something goes wrong. I would like to have a replacement or a refund if possible in it’s entirety.",2020年3月4日 在美国审核

Excellent condition and very happy!,"I was amazed how good the condition was opening the box. The iPhone works perfectly like it's brand new. I was also surprised that there was also a new screen protector applied to the phone's screen too. There's only minor wear and tear around the camera bezel and one little scratch next to the power button on the side. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. Just as others have said in their reviews the iPhone doesn't come with headphones and it comes in a generic smartphone box and it did come with a generic charger that works just fine.",2019年11月29日 在美国审核
Scam!! Used phone scratched screen not unlocked from previous network.,I would not buy this product. I ordered it thinking that the refurbished it with new screen and new battery like normal refurbish. It looks to me they never even open the phone up. There are scratches all over the screen because whoever had it before did not use a screen protector. Also the battery life is at 83%. This is not a referb phone it looks like they get them in and send them right back out with nothing done to it. Scam!!! Update the phone is still locked to another carrier. They make you pay return shipping. I’m going to put this as five Estars so people see it.,2020年12月20日 在美国审核

A solid device at reasonable price.,I liked the overall condition of the refurbished 256GB IPhone 8 Plus that I received. Everything on the preowned refurbished iPhone looks and works great.

Every thing was great besides the ear piece speaker.,"Every thing seems to work very well on this phone.. I was able to move my sim from my crappy temporary android phone and put it into this phone, it worked immediately. I have Verizon. They only flaw is my ear piece speaker is terrible. I can barely hear any one talking even turned up all the way.. it is also very staticky, raspy, rattly when the other person is talking.. and you really can tell the ear piece is crappy when playing music through the phone. I don’t want to deal with returning it so now I have to pay 70$ to replace my ear piece.

Almost two years and still going strong.,"As a luddite and unemployed person, I couldn't exactly buy one of Apple's latest and greatest face-scanning, movie producing, home button-lacking smartphones. So I settled on the last plus sized phone they made with a home button. For anyone who doesn't know, it isn't actually a button but it basically acts like one. Look up iPhone 8 home button for more information. The phone I received was packaged well enough to ship but it certainly wasn't an Apple unboxing. It came with a cable that probably worked with it but I have enough as is so I never really tested it. The phone has very minor scratches on the edges and screen, nothing egregious but large enough to notice every few weeks. It helps to have a case on it to hide a few of the cosmetic blemishes on the sides. The battery also wasn't the best being shipped to me with somewhere between 80-85%. I ended up replacing the battery when the opportunity presented itself and I haven't done anything else to it. I bought this phone to use with Tracfone and it has work totally fine since activating the sim card. In conclusion, if you are looking a phone that won't break the bank and still want to have a home button, this will probably do well enough. I've had this phone for almost two years now and I intend to use it for as long as I can, probably until they stop giving it new iOS updates.",2022年4月9日 在美国审核

Why pay a premium for a phone from your wireless provider?,"This was the first time buying a used refurbished cell phone instead of getting a new one.The reason is simple, the price.The renewed iPhone 8+ came via FedEx a few days after it was ordered, packaged in new box and well protected.The screen already had a glass protector on it but showed no evident scratches.The back of the phone showed no signs of wear either.Came with a generic new, listed as certified charger and cable, did not try those yet.Used an Apple charger and cable to charge it, which was quick.Mirroring the apps, contacts and details from the old iPhone to this one was slick and maybe took 20-30 minutes.It is supposed to come with a sim card removal tool/pin, there was none, but I had one already. Easy to change.Once changed and powered, verified with Verizon rep that the phone was showing up on the network.Battery life is good for a full day's typical use but that can be subjective since everyone uses their phone differently.So far so good, a worthwhile purchase.",2020年11月16日 在美国审核

“Refreshed” doesn’t mean new battery,"Everything is fine, it’s an unlocked phone that doesn’t have any real scratches or dings... but it also doesn’t have a new battery. Battery life said 82%. Guessing their cutoff is 80% for a battery replacement. If I have to bolt on the time and cost of the battery replacement, it’s not cheaper than Apple refurbished... which come with new batteries. Taking it to get a new battery tomorrow at the Apple Store... add on half a day and $100 to the cost. Meh, I’d be thrilled if this had a new battery but as it stands pretty underwhelmed.

Worth what you pay,"I am extremely surprised with this product! Received it two days before it was estimated to arrive. I have never purchased an item that has been refurbished as I have always been wary of authenticity of the product, however everything works great. The camera works great, and the speakers are very loud and clear. My main concern when considering to buy was how I wasn’t able to know the phones physical condition before buying. It seems as though there’s a scuff or small dent in all four corners of the phone but seeing as I am putting a thick case on it they’re not visible and as such I’m not worried about them. I am very glad that there are no scratches whatsoever on the screen, however there were two deep scratches on the back, but luckily no other scratches besides those. It doesn’t seem like there’s any other issues. Overall, I’m pleased with the product, it’d be a 10/10 from me if there wasn’t any physical damage to the phone but overall, I’d rather pay for this than a new phone at full price. I’d buy it again. Also, got authentic charger and charging adapter, unfortunately I didn’t receive any headphones :/ but good purchase all around",2019年6月15日 在美国审核

"BAD BATTERY NOT “LIKE NEW”, IT IS “LIKE USED”!!","This phone was advertised as “renewed” yet when I got it the paint was scratched near the camera lenses and more importantly the battery capacity is under 90%. As I write this review I can see the battery draining. (It went down 5%) This battery was fully charged 5 hours ago. Just sitting there with no activity it went down to 86%, and I just got it yesterday. I called Amazon BEFORE I purchased this phone to find out about this “renewed” program. The Amazon rep stated that “renewed” is like brand new. Well, having scratches near the camera, and a battery capacity that is under 90% is NOT “like new” it is “like used”.I am now noticing a discoloring at the bottom of the screen. This is just another scam like “refurbished” is. I have sent in my refund request. For all the trouble I went through in setting up this phone I could pay 50$ more and go to the Apple Store to get a better phone.",2019年10月9日 在美国审核

READ!!!!!!******DEFECTIVE PHONE/SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!!!!********,"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM SELLER, SELLS DEFECTIVE PHONES... UPDATE 2/27/20- after being unable to get into the phone to delete apple account bc THE PHONE COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING &amp; WOULD NOT TURN ON AT ALL ... they are unable to process a refund... unable to get into apple ID(own fault recovery was linked to old phone number) we are out $400 and the iPhone that has already been returned and IS IN THEIR POSSESSION... COMPLETELY SCAM, had they sold us a functioning phone NONE of this would be happening... reporting to amazon as well. Lesson learned and I SHOULD HAVE listened to the reviews prior to purchasing.We received this phone and within 2 days it shuts off randomly, goes all black, blank or red screen.. when turned back on, all white lines appear all over the phone... about 15 TIMES A DAY (with full battery). Contacted seller to see what we are going to do about this obvious defective phone that was not cheap... hoping to just swap the item purchased for one that is not defective.. stay tuned.**This review is subject to change once a response is received or the issued is resolved** UPDATED 2/27/20",2020年1月12日 在美国审核

Looks like new but buy extended warranty!,"Love the phone, looks like new and great price. Apple store tested it as it “freezes up” which Apple said was due to severely deteriorated battery. Renewed sold by Apple includes a new battery and new case- this seller agreed to reimburse for new battery and case is perfect. I am pleased, must submit the receipt.$49 and it had to be special ordered, 5-day wait. Worth the money but Iphone 8+ still freezes up. Need to go back to Apple techs. Unfortunately Apple does not sell extended warrantees on Renewed phones unless they are the seller. I am just past the 30 days to buy Amazons extended warranty. So if freezing up cannot be resolved I must make a decision quick.",2021年3月8日 在美国审核

This is aftermarket trash,This phone came with a camera that had a busted and cracked glass making all of the photos taken with it come out blurry and unusable. Contacted seller and they FINALLY agreed to pay for the cost of repair after going back and forth. I got it repaired but it did not fix the camera. What I did learn is that every single part of this phone is aftermarket - the tech said that there’s aftermarket parts that he didn’t even know existed. I thought something was fishy about this phone b/c the screen resolution is way lower than my old 7 plus and the keyboard lags. Just really upset and disappointed given the cost of the phone. I am now RETURNING the phone and the seller is fine with it. Thank goodness. Go away GM Deals and stop scamming people with expensive FAKE phones. Please!,2020年10月9日 在美国审核

IPHONE 8 PLUS SOUND DEFECTIVE VERY HARD TO LISTEN AND TALK USING SPEAKER ONLY,The phone was physically in very good condition. Seller sent it in very timely manner and very nicely packaged. I end up returning it and seller issued a refund also in timely manners. Overall the services provided by seller is the best. But unfortunately seller didn't write in description about sound defective. It was almost impossible to talk without turning speaker on. The voice so bad and split kind sometimes very hard for me to understand and others complained same. The button on side used manually to turn sound high also not functioning well enough. When I turned button to highest sound as soon I release it i seen volume gets low automatically again. First I thought to get it fixed on my own using local iphone repair shop but later decided to simply return it. I love iphone 8 plus size its size very nice too. Overall my experience is not good as I wasted my so much time in switching all data setting it up and them cleaning that up switching again to old iphone 5 very frustrating....but will start over. I advise instead of buying refurbished better get some local prepaid services with new phone contract.....,2020年1月8日 在美国审核

Rarely have I been so dissatisfied with an Amazon purchase,"Long story short, found out a code prevents me from turning location services on so NONE OF THE MAPS APPS WORK!! Contacted seller numerous times, told reset phone to factory. SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT NEEDED DOING WHEN YOU SENT TBE PHONE!! Now have no computer to download essential info so it’s not lost during reset, have been traveling for a month with no way to navigate. A MAJOR REASON FOR THIS PURCHASE. Putting my information on the cloud so it’s subject to hacking is not acceptable, your form emails instructing me to do so are not helpful. I want my money back.",2018年9月29日 在美国审核

"Lengthly review but please make sure you read completely,in the end  Apple Rocks!","I got my phone early, looked good no external damage. I activated my phone, no problems (Yet), as it happened my wife was out and called me I put my phone on speaker, I could hear her but she couldn't hear me she was in the store and we attributed it to bad service, she called me again from outside and same issue. When she got home she called me. Again if I had my speaker on I could hear but she couldn't hear me, if she had her speaker on she could hear me but I couldn't hear her. *** I did contact seller through Amazon and they did approve me return the phone sent address labels and everything, they were very much working with me, I really didn't want to wait or go through the time and hassle of returning my phone, but like I said the seller was working with me **** Now, there was an Apple store about 45 minutes away, I made an appointment for them just to check everything was set up correctly for me which it was, they ran a couple of diagnostic test on the phone, 1 result said battery needed to be replaced, 2 said the lower left speaker was bad and needed to be replaced and there was 1 other fault, feeling devastated at this point because your thinking I just bought this phone and have these issues. Well God is good, the tech said that the phone still had Apple care and that everything was covered, the tech said because of all the issues he recommended replacing the phone, as we are talking one of the other employees walks out with a Brand New I Phone and the tech went through with me and activated and set up my New phone and we dumped and reset the old phone back to when I received it. Apple/Apple store in Annapolis, MD you rock!!!!! Got me a Brand New Phone for exchange of bad phone and ZERO DOLLARS!!!!! God is Good!!!! Plus my New phone now also has Apple Care for any future issues! My suggestion to anyone who buys an I Phone through Amazon and has issues like me try your local Apple store, you may get Blessed or lucky like me without the hassle of returning it.",2021年3月9日 在美国审核

Great deal,"This iphone is gorgeous, I hooked it up initially on my existing Tmobile and that was a nightmare upgrading to them. Tried to tell me I had to get a new plan as it was not compatible with this iphone, that was a lie. Sold me a bunch of garbage I didn't want or need and ruined my existing plan. Took 1.5 hours to upgrade me because tmobile people are stupid, wasted my time. Charged me for a new sim card, charged me for an activation fee, charged me to give me a ""free"" tablet, but then gave me no data on my iphone. I returned the free tablet for a restocking fee, was on the phone for 4 hours to Tmobile clear all this up with multiple visits to Tmobile store. So, I switched to Mint with Ryan Reynolds for 1/2 price unlimited text, data, and phone 15.00 per month. The beauty of it was, I didn't need to pay Mint mobile for their new mint sim card, nor did I have to pay an activation fee. They use the Tmobile network. This Tmobile phone worked with mint instantly, that set up could all be done remotely online. for free with noone trying to scam me, give me free tablets, that I had to pay for and return, lie, or sell me cards or activation fee, nor did mint mobile waste my time. This iphone worked perfectly with the new plan and that set up process was a breeze. This iphone is really beautiful. It has been a month since I got it and battery health is at 91%. I am very pleased with this purchase and 90 day warranty, but as a disclaimer, I have not needed the warranty, so cannot speak to if that actually works if necessary. I would definitely buy a used iphone on amazon again because of this purchase. I actually bought another iphone 8 plus for my elderly mom, and she is pleased.",2020年3月8日 在美国审核

You Get What You Pay For - Done With Refurbished,"After 3 returns, I finally gave up on ordering a refurbished iPhone. The 1st one came with a busted mic, meaning someone on the other end could not hear me talking during a phone call. The 2nd and 3rd orders came from a different vendor and both had the same issue: busted speakers. It was a case in which the left speaker wasn’t equal with the right speaker. Like when you listen to a song with only one earbud. That was how all sound came out of the phone. Some sounds came in clear and other sounds came in muffled and in the background. I know this sounds a bit picky, but if I’m paying $500+ for a phone, having the speakers output properly is important to me. You can do speaker tests on YouTube but I do not believe this is a test that amazon runs they’re phones through, since the same problem occurred twice in a row.",2020年6月25日 在美国审核

My first IPhone,"I recently switched over from Android and I am really liking this phone much better than the Droid.All of the issues that I was having; mostly connectivity issues are completely gone. The screen interface and the ease of using apps is great. The camera is awesome; video and picture is extremely HD and almost as good as watching a regular HD TV; in fact I use my phone more than my TV. By the weight I feel of the phone is of very good quality and seems very durable - I go nowhere without it. I also noticed the good quality in my Itunes music that it's much better compared to my Ipod that I used for music (I had to have an IPod in addition to my droid but no more). My only complaint is that I wish the battery life were longer; I usually only get 2 or 3 days max on each charge, but that's a battery issue that we will have to deal with until batteries are revolutionized to last for weeks - maybe that day will come soon. One thing I almost forgot is that if you have 'plug-in' headphones, you will not like the fact that there is no port for them. You will have to by wireless; does't affect me because I haven't used plug-in earbuds for years.",2020年2月26日 在美国审核

Good Customer Service,I purchased two iPhone 8 pluses as Christmas presents.Both were delivered very fast and appeared to be in good shape.Unfortunately when I went to activate the phones on Christmas Day one of them showed up as stolen and could not be activated by AT&amp;T. The AT&amp;T rep said it was likely someone abandoned the account before paying it off and that is why it was ”locked”.I contacted Renew Pros thru Amazon about the issue and they were very quick to assist with a return and a refund.The silver lining was I was able to purchase an IPhone X from Renew Pros a week later for about the same price as the 8 and has worked great thus far.,2022年1月6日 在美国审核

Exactly as advertised,"Arrived with 2% max battery capacity over the minimum—I was initially concerned about this, but it seems to hold a charge pretty well so no complaints. The phone was in pristine condition—I couldn’t tell it was used TBH. Came with a charging cord and adapter that work well with the unit.I bought this because I could not read my newspaper subscriptions and emails on the tiny iPhone SE. I am able to read pretty well on this (much larger) screen. I have a ton of apps on my phone, and they barely put a dent in the 256gb memory. Yay! I was tired of of constantly deleting photos and removing less-used apps (only to reinstall them again later after deleting others).Out of “an abundance of caution” I purchased an Otterbox Defender case for the phone on eBay. The few times I’ve dropped it, my heart nearly stopped... but the phone is fine and works like a charm. Even with the built in screen protector, the keyboard is still responsive.",2020年3月17日 在美国审核

"Bad phone, not what was advertised","This phone was advertised as renewed in excellent condition. I expect a phone in excellent condition to be able to restart when you hold the home and power button down for 10 seconds. This phone doesn’t do that. It also glitches from time to time where the screen freezes up for up to five minutes. I’m returning it because I don’t want to find out what else will go wrong after the return window closesUpdate: I ordered the exact same phone again to replace the glitchy one. This one was even worse! It also lacks the ability to restart when you hold down the power and home buttons, it also does not recognize a Verizon SIM card aven though the fed I says ‘Verizon only’. To make matters worse, I’ve bought screen protectors that I will have to peel off and throw away before I return both bad phones.

Worth the upgrade!,"I love almost everything about the phone. This is an amazing new phone for being a renewed device. Awesome battery life and screen quality! I also like how they managed to give you a screen protector on the device, a SIM card slot opener with charging cable and block for the device. The only downside I didn’t like which I can’t really be picky about so much since it is a used phone was that there was some dings on the side of the phone in some places along the sides of the device and on some places around the camera as well but it doesn’t cause any defects to the camera at all. Also, (might I add) Amazon doesn’t ship the phone, it’s an individual seller so I don’t understand how it’s under “prime” when it took a week (in total) to get to me (you get two day shipping if you have prime but it still got to me in 3 days) and the seller marked the phone as “new” but you can CLEARLY tell it is a used phone when you look at it so BEWARE of slight false advertising by the seller/Amazon. I was a little hesitant at first to purchase because of all the mixed reviews but I’m happy I took a chance! This is the best upgrade from my last iPhone. Definitely pleased with my “new” phonelol",2021年1月9日 在美国审核
Great Buy,"I highly recommend you buy this phone and save yourself a lot of money. The phone arrived in perfect shape and looked exactly like a brand new phone. The phone I received didn't even have a scratch on it anywhere. Even if it would have, the phone went into a case so that would not of been a issue. I actually trust this more than a new one because this was went over by a tech person so you know there will be no issues and there were none.The battery life is the same as if it were brand new and everything is working perfectly.

FAULTY PRODUCT!!,"This phone has literally failed me after only a few months of having it, and I’m having consistent problems with getting it to charge. It started off that it wouldn’t charge sometimes, but now it’s constant! Not to mention, when I first got it, there was already a small chip taken out of the screen that I just overlooked. You’re better off just paying several hundred dollars more to get a new one, instead of throwing your money away on a faulty product like this, that won’t even last you 6 months before you have to replace it!

Just okay,"This is my second BuySpry seller purchase of an iPhone. The first, an Amazon Renewed jet black 256gb iPhone 7 Plus, only had 84% battery health. This Amazon Renewed 64gb iPhone 8 Plus battery is at 94% but has a fairly scratched up screen that was covered by a fresh screen protector upon receipt. FWIW, an out of warranty screen repair on this phone is $169 from Apple, so it’s actually cheaper to buy from Apple as a Certified Refurbished if you want an absolutely pristine “renewed” iPhone because those phones get brand new batteries and new screens.Still haven’t decided if I’ll keep this one. For me, the cost savings just doesn’t quite make up for the screen being this scratched.",2019年7月23日 在美国审核
Keeps shutting off.,"I like big iPhone with no niches so the only relatively new option that I have is the iPhone 8 Plus. And since Apple does not sell it anymore, I bought this iPhone directly from Amazon so it is much easier to return in case the phone was not as claimed. This was called “Amazon Renewed Premium” and the price was around twenty percent more that the price of other similar Amazon Renewed iPhones sold by third party seller, which I never buy from.A couple of days later, I got the iPhone8 Plus with the nice package and a long certificate which assured me that the iPhone was inspected by “certified technicians.”Anyway, I started using the phone and it started shutting off. I thought that was okay. Then it did again and again and again. I updated the iPhone to IOS14, but the problem kept happening. It shuts off every hour or so on its own.Bottom line, I am very disappointed and I am planning to return it. Believe me, buy new and save yourselves all this headache.",2020年9月27日 在美国审核

The only thing I noticed is that there are micro scratches on the display glass, however, they can ONLY be seen when you aim the display at the sun (who even does that?).

It’s a used phone.,"I got this after my previous iPhone had been stolen and I didn’t like the notch on the newer ones so I settled on the iPhone 8’s. When I received it I was happy to see that they had included a OEM Apple cable and brick for charging. The phone was free of any major defects and everything worked as it should except for the earpiece being slightly damaged and prone to fuzziness and distortion at even moderate volume. A single scuff was on a corner of the chassis indicating that it had been dropped at some point, though who hasn’t dropped their phone at least once right? The battery was in near perfect condition according to the iPhone battery health check which was nice. The only reason that the price was maybe justified was that I had selected the Product (Red) edition. Still, it was a high price for a used base 64GB configuration iPhone from two generations back.<br>Ps.

BuySPRY: Not As Good As Other Certified Refurbished iPhones I've Purchased on Amazon,"I want to preface this review by stating that this is the fourth Certified Refurbished iPhone I've purchased on Amazon. Ihave bought a 16 GB Rose Gold iPhone 6s Plus from Kiss Electronics Inc, a 16 GB Rose Gold iPhone 6s from ELECTRONIC DEALS, and a 32 GB Rose Gold iPhone 7 Plus from MyWit. All three of those iPhones I purchased arrived in a condition that was nearly indistinguishable from brand new, with the exception of the battery. None of them had any noticeable scratches or scuffs on the screen, or on the metal casing or back, and all components worked normally. One of them arrived with a battery that could only charge to 80% of it's original capacity, but the seller prompty reimbursed the ~ $35.00 I paid to Apple to get the battery replaced.I purchased this 64 GB Gold iPhone 8 Plus from BuySPRY to replace an old iPhone 6 I had that would no longer turn on due to water damage. The device arrived in nice packaging with a third party charger and lightning cable, and even included a SIM removal tool (a nice touch, it's way easier to use than trying to jam a paperclip into the SIM hole)The good: The metal sides and glass back of the phone are in impeccable condition, indistinguishable from that of a new iPhone right out of the box. The buttons, cameras, sensors, and microphones all appear to be in normal working order.The okay: Battery health is at 89%; obviously not as good as that of a brand new phone, but actually better than most of the other certified refurbished iPhones I have purchased on Amazon.The bad: The screen is NOT in perfect condition. There is a scratch in the lower left quadrant of the screen, ~ 3/4 of a centimeter long that is clearly visible in normal usage when viewed against a light background. The stereo speakers sound clearly distorted, especially at louder volumes. Apple advertises the 8 Plus as having louder, better stereo speakers than those on the iPhone 7 Plus, but the stereo speakers on my iPhone 7 Plus sound WAY better than those on my iPhone 8 Plus (my 7 Plus speakers can get pretty loud without sounding distorted or blown out).Conclusion: I know it may sound like I'm being too harsh in my review of this iPhone 8 Plus. I'm sure that many people would be totally fine using this phone as their everyday phone without issue, and I may continue to use this phone as my main phone for the time being because I'm strongly considering upgrading this fall. I might just tolerate this phone's flaws for until then, because it is still such a pain in the ass to migrate from one iPhone to another.But I cannot help but be disappointed because this clearly doesn't live up to the excellent standard I became accustomed to with the 3 other Certified Refurbished iPhones I purchased on Amazon.",2019年6月28日 在美国审核

The maximum capacity for the battery came at 89%but it still lasts all day. It came with a generic cord and an Apple charging block.

The phone arrived in excellent, like-new condition. The phone's battery life has so far exceeded that of my old iphone 6s, and the performance was snappy. It felt like I had just taken this phone out of the original packaging... except for the defective touch screen. The screen on the phone I received would often fail to register my touches.

Crack on home button etc.,"Just received my iPhone 8 plus in the mail today and at first glance it looked to be in good condition, but when I removed it from the bubble wrap I immediately noticed the home button had been cracked. I looked around the rest of the phone and there are some minor scratches and wear and tear but what caught my attention was the weird off-colored molding that holds the phone in place? I'm not sure how to explain it but it looks like a tacky-glue job was placed to cover up other damage in the lining of the phone. I hope this doesn't cause any mechanical issues with the phone because that's definitely not what I paid for. So far no issues turning it on and using it so we'll keep an eye out.",2020年4月28日 在美国审核
Screen cracked when we got it and is still cracking,"3/6/22: phone doesn't hold a charge for very long and like I started before the charging box has never worked. When I got correspondence from seller about screen protector they told me it was explained there was one, I've searched and find no info like that.2nd update 2/14/22: There was a screen protector that came on the phone, that is what was cracking and after we took it off the actual screen was fine. The phone is functioning well and actually better now that the screen protector from the seller has been removed.Update: 2/11/22 Finally getting to the email from the company that is telling me after I had to send pictures that if I send the phone back they will give me a refund..... So my daughter will be out of a phone for how long..?! I'm so mad! The screen is cracking more each day and is almost unusable as well as the fact the glass is now sharp. I would avoid this company at all costs! Obviously they sell a crappy product that will fall apart and cost you more time and energy than just going and buying a newer one. :(My daughter saved up and treats this phone like a baby, yet the small crack it came with is not not the only one now. There are cracks showing up more and more. It's had a screen protector and case on it grub the minute we opened it. It has not been dropped. Faulty screen is all I can think of.

My screws were stripped, the phone did not have the apple water seal, meaning the phone had water damage before it got to me.

"Overall good deal, some issues with phone","The biggest issue I have is that the screen must have been replaced in a way that True Tone is no longer even an option on the phone. I do believe that the screen is oem, as the colors are pretty good, but since true tone is not an option it could just be a good knockoff screen, either way the screen looks good so not having true tone isn't enough to go through a return. The battery health is at 87%, which is fine, but after it dips around 80% I'm gonna have to pay $50 for a replacement battery. It is only guaranteed to be at 80, which seems kind of low since Apple recommends the battery be changed at 80, but this is not the fault of the seller, 87 is fine and more than guaranteed. Overall the phone is a good deal and it came in good condition, but the fact that the screen was replaced in a way where it doesn't offer true tone anymore is enough to knock off two starts for me.",2020年2月8日 在美国审核

If ur holding the phone wit the screen facing u the left speakers don’t work not sure y.OVERALL&gt;Other than those things it’s pretty good.

not a good buy.  Phone was missing parts. Phone broke easily,Updated 2 months after using phone.....This phone seemed really good at first.Then the screen broke the first time i dropped it on the carpet. I took it in to get fixed and they said my phone was missing a metal plate on the front that holds the screen in place.So i have to get one to make sure the screen keeps breaking.It also had the home button quit working and start working again. And one time it died and took an entire day to turn back on while plugged in.I wouldnt buy it again knowing what i now know,2020年3月27日 在美国审核

I can’t totally complain as it was above the stated 80% or better. The one I got is at 85%, which is fine and useable. I was just hoping for maybe 90% or better. Anyway, great phone and great price!I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus that I had for 5-6 years, so this is a nice upgrade from that. I didn’t want to shell out over $1000 for an iPhone 12, plus I’m not a fan of Face ID since I have to wear a mask at work. This iPhone 8 Plus has Touch ID which always works great and super fast.

Doesn’t recognize my fingerprint! So back to apple we go. I will never buy another phone made by apple. What a big bunch of wasted time. Took off 2 step verification. It works finally.

Terrible speakers,"This was the second of two iphone 8s we purchased in the same month from different sellers. The first came securely packaged, with a nice charger very similar to the original. The speakers can be listened to without external amplification, and sound beautiful.

Buy if you want phone that don't work porperly,"I ordered two GOLD iPhone 8 PLUS 64gb fully unlocked (renewed) for my two younger sisters. It arrived on July 6th, 2020. I transferred their own phone over to the new phone. When it arrived, it's on a 3rd party box with 3rd party charger and 3rd party cable. There was no headphones, which my sisters don't really care for. The conditions is a solid 9/10 (since it's renewed). They have been using it for only 24 hours now and so far, when I ask them, is the phone good? Anything wrong with it? They told me, no. Since I haven't give them a phone number yet, I can't test if it will accept T-Mobile SIM card. I hope it does.EDIT: (UPDATE) 05/28/2021So, apparently one of the phone I've purchased on July 2020, doesn't work. I had returned one phone and bought it again with another venders/seller. That phone that I purchased with the other seller is working properly. The phone that I still have that I purchased from this seller is not working properly. I've added the phone to my phone plan and installed a SIM Card on it. Usually it would read the SIM Card and worked properly. But I installed it, wait for it to read, it didn't. I turned it off, turned it back on and was hoping that would work. It didn't I tried it more than a couple of times as well. Still nothing. I went to T-Mobile (my carrier), and they told me that the phone was ""report stolen and locked by Sprint."" I was shocked to find that out. Sprint had blocked/locked the SIM Card reader or whatever and that was why it wasn't reading the SIM Card whatsoever. I emailed the seller and they told me that because it has been more than 3 months, the warranty is out. I told them that with the Amazon Renewed Product, it stated that for Renewed Premium, I should still have 1 year warrranty. The person that was emailing me back, told me to send it back for a replacement. I told them I wanted a refund because I'm not about to purchased/replace it with the phones from them knowing that the phones that they sell is not working properly. They told me that they cannot do that. I'm really frustrated that they don't make a exception in this case because it was not my fault but the phone. I'm sure NOBODY would take a replacement cause I'm sure as hell am not taking the chance. So they just told me to call Amazon directly for help. This is really a simple and easily solvable matter that would leave both party happy. Yet, they make this so hard. Yes, the customer support response fast, but other than that, each customer support that email you back, don't even do their job properly. They don't even read the email going back and forth. Each email contradict the other. I sure as hell won't be purchasing from this seller no more. And I hope this review would help people trying to buy iPhones avoid this seller. That's all I got.",2020年7月8日 在美国审核

SELLER IS A SCAM ARTIST!!!!,I bought this phone and after a week or so it had days it won’t hold a charge even when barely used. I had my son who has always had iPhones look at it see if I had something running in the background or if it was a settings thing. Nothing unusual. Just some days the battery would drain so I figured it was defective. I requested to return it to the seller as defective and they agreed. WELL… it took 3 weeks and a complaint about them to Amazon before they processed my return AND they charged me a $135 restocking fee for the return!! Unbelievable. Not only are they ripping me off but plan on doing it to someone else. Makes me wonder how many times they’ve resold the same defective phone! Btw I bought the same phone from another seller on Amazon and have been perfectly happy with it.,2021年5月28日 在美国审核

Don't gamble your money and waste your time.,"I purchased this phone knowing it was used in ""renewed"" ""excellent"" condition. I absolutely expected light scratches and imperfections.

It is deep enough to be seen at all times with the screen on or off.I foolishly assumed that it was a hair under the screen protector. No big deal, right? Ordered a new screen protector and while I waited on it to arrive, I went ahead and set the phone up and activated it. Once I got the new screen protector, I peeled the old one off only to discover the damaged screen. This is definitely noticeable at ""arm's length"".

No way to know,The i-phone 8 was in great physical condition as advertised. The phone had microphone issues and would not transmit voice in phone conversations. The microphone would work to record answer message and notes but not on phone conversation. We were told it was a common i-phone 8plus defective software issue. The phone was insured and was replaced by my carrier (SIM card) company. Yes it was an ordeal!,2020年9月13日 在美国审核

Shipping takes longer than expected,Honestly so far so good . The phone was unlocked fully from what I can tell so far . The battery is at 90% capacity which is decent . I’ve come to notice though that the left speaker on the phone doesn’t work and it makes the right speaker sound distorted at times . The shipping also took way too long . I am an amazon prime member and I used my 2 day free shipping that comes with the membership but the phone took 5 days to get to me . That’s just a little unreasonable . Other than that the phones in okay condition no major scratches or anything like that . Lived up to my expectation besides the speakers .,2020年2月27日 在美国审核

Poorly refurbished phone.,"I bought this iPhone 8 Plus almost three months ago and everything seemed to work great at first. It wasn’t until after the first month, problems began to develop. The front speaker stopped working, then the touch screen would randomly open app’s without even touching the screen. I tried to reach out to the seller and they refused to replace the phone even though it is in there policy. Another month later, the phone would get very hot during charging and the phone would become very slow. I assume it must be a battery issue, and also the battery life is terrible. It would not recommend this seller to anyone, who are looking for a good refurbished phone. Unless the seller responds to me and honors their policy, I will be returning it.

"Good overall, but…","I’ve had this phone for about a month now. The screen works fine. Has a couple of scratches but none that bother me. The battery health and camera quality are really good. One issue is that only one speaker works. I assume this is why I can’t set up “hey siri”. I don’t understand this because I don’t have issues with people hearing me during calls and the one speaker is loud enough to satisfy me when I’m watching videos, etc.",2020年6月13日 在美国审核

Didn't work after the 3 month window - Won't refund or replace after they tried to tell me I could!,"I ordered this phone and received it in good condition. We immediately put a case on it and protected it. We had no issues, but after exactly the time of the refund window was over, the WiFi antenna stopped working. There was no mishandling, drops, etc. After doing some extensive research we found that the antenna is within the phone. It's not something we could have accessed to even fix, but why should we when we only had it for JUST over 3 months and handled with care.I contacted the seller and they tried to tell me to return or replace the item. They were willing to call and walk me through the return and were going to replace it with another product.After they realized that the return window was over - again, ironically AFTER the phone WiFi quit working, they stopped trying to fix the problem and quit talking. I can't even press the WiFi to turn it on. I can't turn it on in the settings either.So, don't buy from them because they won't guarantee a good product. I am not one to write reviews, but this is worth writing because the phone isn't even 4 months in my hands and the WiFi can't be turned on, nor will they return, replace, or credit with anything.

A large flaw,Phone was overall good. Looks magnificent and sleek. One MAJOR issues that was apparent. The top speaker that you put up to your ear doesn’t work AT ALL. Like there is literally no sound that come out of that port and I can’t call anyone. Then another thing is the glue they used to keep the screen to the phone. I’ve heated it up over and over and still can’t get the screen off to fix my issue.

Don’t buy anything from model electronics,"I unfortunately bought this from “Model Electronics.” The product sent to me is and continues to be subpar, as is their customer service. There is no way that the phone they sent me lives up to the Amazon renewed standard of “ High-Quality ProductProfessionally inspected, tested, and cleaned to work and look like new.” The phone I received was missing pretty much all of its internal screws, all connector plates, and the back plate for the screen. This information was only found out after I droppedthe phone while in a very protective case and it stopped working. And of course, it cost me money to find out this information. Now it has unfortunately been more than a year since I bought this subpar phone, and it is having more issues, unsurprisingly because of the missing components. The touchscreen no longer recognizes touch on the left and right sides as well as at the top. I have gotten in contact with the company that sold me this phone, and they refuse to do anything about the problems I am having because they sold me a subpar piece of equipment which is missing its inner components.

The mobile is unusable and my money went in vain... For those who are not based in the US before buying such a phone on Amazon you have to make sure that it will be compatible with your GSM network.

Glad I picked the 8 Plus over the X!,"I went from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8 Plus. I considered the X, but just didn't care for that annoying notch, narrower aspect ratio and lack of touch ID, so the 8 Plus was preferable to the X. The bigger screen is a must (especially for people like myself who are always working and rely on a phone when we're away from the office.) You won't regret it!The 8 Plus is extremely heavy compared to the aluminum iPhones; it took me awhile to adjust. After comparing it to the iPhone X, I feel the 8 Plus's heft gives it a premium feel. I just wish they would have at least narrowed the bezels even a smidge. It's past due time for a refresh.The 8 plus has an incredible battery life! The true tone feature is definitely worth the hype and the camera is amazing! I use it all the time and people sometimes ask me ""what kind of DLSR do you have?"" They can't believe I took the photo on my iPhone!",2018年8月14日 在美国审核

"""Renewed"" = ""Used"". It Can Be Souped Up and Parts Replaced ...  But It's Still Used.","I've read a number of the reviews on these ""RENEWED"" phones and<br> the primary point that tends to be missed is NOT just what the phone is delivered as when receiving the package, BUT what the USED phone is like a year later. On any USED item, this should be what is most important. When I first received my USED phone from BuySPRY, I thought it was ""incredible"". It literally looked and acted close to ""brand new"" and I saw no issues over the next month. THAT is a company that cares about its customer. Right? However, the one thing that adding a little spit polish and tightening a few things here and there does NOT offer is winding the clock backwards. With that said, SURE it's a nice USED. However, it IS USED. I probably saved around$100 on mine. My other Apple did well for about three years before it started slowing down a bit. I figured this one might be two ... maybe a year and a half? I mean, you get what you pay for here, right? NOPE. One YEAR LATER, the phone was already acting like my last Apple after THREE YEARS. In fact, it was acting WORSE. The battery charge was even a lot shorter. So, keep in mind that HERE you commonly DO NOT get what you pay for with these products. You can view this as saving a little $ up front. However, this phone should have been another $100 off. THAT is all it was worth. BUYER BEWARE!</br>",2020年11月16日 在美国审核

"Bought 2 (separate occasions), neither as advertised","3 weeks ago I bought an iPhone 8 Plus from this company. It was advertised fully unlocked as well as network unlocked. Well knowing that I would need to link my network to it, I had the reasonable expectation it would be fully unlocked. It was not. The device still had some sort of network attached from the previous owner and I am not able to unlock it myself nor take it to a store to break it. I returned it and ordered one that was specific to my network (Sprint). I got the phone, it did not come with a SIM card as advertised (not too big of a deal) but the phone was still activated on someone else's sprint account. I can't suggest for anyone to not buy from this business, but given the bad circumstances, I am certain you will have a negative experience.",2020年4月22日 在美国审核

iPhone 8S major dissappointment,"I've been an iPhone user since the beginning.Its always seemed like a solid easy to use product, with the exception of the screen in sunlight and outdoor pictures, which I'm convinced is the worst among other smart phones.I recently updated from 6S to 8S, and the screen and pictures are still very bad outdoors, but the biggest complaint is they got rid of the headset port.There's only the charging port, which I'm at loss to why they think 1 port is convenient in any way, especially when traveling, which is the whole idea of MOBILE!!",2019年4月3日 在美国审核
"Very disappointed, my item arrived defective. I would choose some other seller.","I got my product, it looked great at the beginning, screen was great, no scratches,just a minor one on the back, seemed pretty good, great battery life, probably a full charge lasts all day from 9am to 8pm of regular phone use. Everything else seemed awesome, till I tried to make my first call. The person I was calling was not able to hear me. I tried to record voice memos; it would not record my voice, just a static sound, and the same sound with no voice that the person that received my call described. Researching a bit and doing some basic tests I found out that the lower microphones were damaged. Top microphones (front and rear) do record normal audio.I'm disappointed with Amazon as before purchasing my device I asked costumer service about the seller, the product and if they could guarantee that I would get a good functional product; they said that I was going to be very satisfied with it. I explained that I was going to be traveling out of the country and I needed to make sure I was going to get a fully functional product with no flaws as I was not going to be able to go through any return process. They reassured me that I was going to be very satisfied with the product.Guess what it was not. After I complained about it, they told me that the only solution was to return the product and get my money back. But for me it is impossible right now as I’m abroad. I tried to write to Fiesta Renew, the seller to see if they could give me a solution, I didn't expect to receive a defective device and now I'm unable to return it. They never answered back. The worst thing is that it is a very obvious damage; it’s hard to believe that it “successfully passed a full diagnostic of tests and inspections fulfilled by Amazon-qualified suppliers”.Long story short I’m stuck with a defective device, unable to return it and no other solutions were given to my nor by Amazon or Fiesta Renew.I would choose a different seller.",2020年1月19日 在美国审核

It locks up, it goes completely black and acts like a computer saying its locked and need ti reboot. The battery is constantly drained, yes I power save and dont havea lot going on. I even bought a new battery and charger. Still I lose my phone for days, i take out the battery and let sit then re install. I am a creature of habit, i keep things long time. I still dont have everything on this phone that i use to. My family says Its my fault for not getting a newer phone, and that even though i have 4g the phone is slow. again i dont expect perfection but now i cant even use my alarm clock . I know I cant return it but now i have to go find another phone and start over. That is what I didnt want to do, thats why I had it since it came out. I hope you appreciate the great review and please hope I can find a phone I actually like and it works.Thank You, Carmen Wilson",2014年7月1日 在美国审核
"Fast, sturdy, and easy to use","This is a great phone with a lot of excellent features.I was impressed with the size of both the internal memory (which was a BIG problem with the HTC Status/ChaCha I had before this) and the generous 8 gig micro SD card included with the phone.I love how fast everything loads and runs.The screen is large, clear, and responds quickly to touch.Would totally recommend this phone!The only problem I encountered (and a number of other people seem to have run into this s well) is connecting to the internet when no wifi is available-- perhaps it depends on where the phone originates from, but even with it being unlocked, I had to fuss with the settings for the mobile network before being able to connect.SO!If you have AT&amp;T and are having trouble connecting to the internet when no wifi is available, hopefully the following will save you a couple of hours with customer service and lots of frustration. :)(I'm sure there are other similar solutions to be found online for other carriers other than ATT)Look under settings&gt; wireless&amp;networks&gt; mobile network. If there is an error message that says ""connection failed due to incorrect APN settings"", select the ""mobile network settings"" underneath that.Select ""Access Point Names"".You'll either have to edit an existing name, or, if they're locked, create a new name by pressing the menu button.The information you'll need to enter to connect to the internet via the mobile network is as follows:Name: AT&amp;TAPN: wap.cingularProxy: leave blankPort: leave blankUsername:WAP@CINGULARGPRS.COMPassword:CINGULAR1Server: leave blankMMSC:[...]MMS Proxy: [...]MMS Port: 80MCC:310MNC:410 (this could also be 310, 41 or 15)APN Type: leave blankMake sure those settings are there and give it a try (with wifi off to ensure you're connecting through the cell network and not a wifi connection).Otherwise, this phone has been just wonderful and truly impressive.",2012年4月13日 在美国审核
Poor reception makes this a phone to avoid,"I really wanted to like this phone.My first smart phone was a Droid Incredible, so I thought this would be a good choice.But I will likely look for another phone because of an issue with bad reception.My house is in an area where cell signals are not very strong.I found that I could get a signal of about 3 bars on the Inspire if I put the phone near a window.The problem is, when I pick up the phone, the signal drops to either one bar or it shows no service.After some experimentation, I found that I could hold the phone near the top of the case and the signal would be usable.The minute I cupped my hand around the back of the phone, as you would when talking on the phone, the signal would drop significantly.The user's guide describes the GSM antenna as being in the bottom cover that covers the sim slot.If you can learn to hold this phone only near the top of the case, it will work.Personally, I'm not satisfied with a phone that is that picky about where I hold it.For the more adventurous who consider rooting their phone and trying to upgrade the Android OS, this is not a phone to choose.The process to get the phone rooted is so complex that I gave up considering it.If you can't be satisfied with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), you'll want to skip this phone.",2013年1月7日 在美国审核
Great phone from bad vendor,"I bought this HTC Inspire phone from vendor ""orderinstant(USA)"" because the price was right for a new unit, and it was listed as Condition:New.It wasn't, far from it.It's badly refurbished, probably by a hobbyist.I also have an Inspire that I bought new from AT&amp;T almost two years ago with none of the following problems, so I also have an originally purchased unit to compare to.The orderinstant(USA) unit has a broken SD card memory slot that doesn't eject cards, you have to dig it out with a fingernail or screwdriver.The area of the SD card slot was already scratched up from the previous owner digging the card out, obviously from the same problem.The back camera is not mounted centered behind the lens glass, partly obstructed by the lens frame of the back cover.There is a lot of dust trapped between the camera lens and the cover glass, resulting in grainy pictures.The centers of the torx case screws are stripped out so you can never take the phone apart again.The 8gig SD card is missing, but I had another one to use.The wall charger isn't the correct one - the wall wart is correct but the cable is different and charges much slower than my original - both wart and cable are branded HTC but the cable is somehow different (it is longer than my original).The top mounted power on/off button requires a large amount of force to push it in to get the phone to see the button press.There was a 12 volt car charger adapter in the box, which was not ever included in a new shrink-wrapped box.Somehow this fell into the box, but was not listed in the seller's listing.Luckily the rest of the hardware works normally, the battery is fine, and the screen is perfect.If this was listed as a refurb with associated price the problems would have been acceptable.Being listed as new with that associated price makes this...deceitful.",2012年12月5日 在美国审核
Great Phone,"Right out the box set up was fast and easy after battery was charged. You need to be careful how you install the battery in the phone compartment-logo goes upside down, not rightside up or else no charge and no power. The battery compartment cover is a real pain to get on and off. You need to gently pry open with the edge of a dime-thinner than a penny and don't be anxious and get carried away as I can see it easily getting broken (it's not very thick plastic, its pretty thin-battery door design is crappy). phone boots up fast and apps load fast. Unlocked as advertised and my SIM from Consumer Cellular worked, no problem. I get good cell signal, great sound on calls, great WiFi signal. I don't use my data plan much as it costs too much so I use WiFi when I can. You can transfer your contacts from your other phone when you go thru set up just by turning on Bluetooth on both phones making that a snap. So far this GSM phone has far surpassed my Samsung and LG. Only had it less than a week but fast shut down and reboot is a snap. I don't understand all the bad ratings.",2014年1月14日 在美国审核
Very fun phone with android and cool features!,"I was really surprised to see that this phone has a lot of cool features! The 8mp camera is amazing BUT I wasn't aware I would need an SD card just to take a picture so I have to go and buy one now because I used to save pictures to my phone. That's alright though. Didn't take too long to set up, it's already synced up to my emails and social networking accounts. The friend stream feature is very cool because it shows facebook and twitter (and whatever else you have) all in one feed. The weather feature is neat because it has this cool hd movement to go with whatever the weather is like (the little things always impress me). The android market changes to google play if you add your google+ account but it is still basically the android market with a different look. One thing I was disappointed in was the app ""Vine"" is not compatible with this phone and I really wanted that app but oh well, it still has a lot of the popular android apps. The screen is big and is pretty much HD (I don't know if HD was in the specs) it's got a great sleek look to it. The battery and sim card hatches are a little tricky but eventually you get the hang of it.",2013年6月18日 在美国审核
Great Phone Even After 2.5 years of continous service,"Have 2 units of the same brand and model. One I rooted and is still going strong even after almost 2.5 years of use. I have another unit that is unlocked and use it occasionally using a different sim card. I was able to use these phones in Canada (Rogers) and in Asia where the norm is GSM. I have tried to justify changing these phone to upgrade to android 4+ as it still uses Android 2.2 and to have a front facing camera but the sturdiness, and reliability of this phone plus the eventual price residual still justifies me using the units further. I purchased a Samsung clone Note 1 phone clone last year for $175 so I could enjoy a bigger screen but I was only able to use the phone for less than 6 months but then became more of a nuisance as it would keep rebooting. The inconvenience of having a clone that is meant to be used in China is not worth it. This phone while already obsolete by todays standards still provide me with reliable service. I just wish it had a front facing camera and an upgrade to Android 4.0",2014年11月13日 在美国审核
Questionable - New or Used?,"***Update*** This phone is horrible. I purchased 3 in all. They all had the same issues. People constantly complained they could not hear me or my wife on both hand held and speaker modes. The charging ports wore out in 3months so we had to constantly fiddle with the it to get it to charge. The battery life is very short. Wifi and Cell signal was poor as well. This is by far the worst phone I have ever had!Only had the phones 7 months and finally gave up; purchased two new phones and we are so much happier with them. Buyer beware!!!At first glance the phone looks new. Once you open the battery and SIM compartment things start to show wear. The charger for sure is used. It has several scratches on it which makes me question the condition of the phone even more. Why sell this on Amazon as new if it is used? Call it what it is and name your price! The battery was completely dead upon arrival so I am charging now. I will post an update when I have had time to play around with it. Four stars for now, simply because I think there seems to be a question of misleading representation on the condition of these phones.",2013年6月11日 在美国审核
Inherent screen freeze with this phone,"Got this phone in the month of September. The device was an used one, but did not have any major scratches or dents/dings. However, it used to frequently restart on it own. That was fine. But recently, the screen actually froze. The usual methods of taking the battery out and restarting the device did not alleviate the problem. I took the other step of actually restoring the device to factory setttings. However, the screen is still frozen and device is now a paper weight (unless I decide to root it and install a custom ROM).Please do read up the reviews on this device and there is actually a huge problem with the phone itself. In some cases, the phone will start up once you remove the battery and put it back in. However, there are many cases, where this does not work. It did not work for me. I will also take it up with Amazon to see what else could be done as this phone has been used by me for only about 5 months and decent amount was paid for the device.Please refrain from buying this particular model.",2014年1月9日 在美国审核
HTC customer service is is horrible. DO NOT BUY HTC,"This phone worked well for about 9 months and then started to fail periodically. Now it will not allow the phone app to work at all. HTC's warranty paperwork states that the phone is warrantied for 1 year from the date of purchase. THAT ISN'T TRUE! They will not honor any warranties from Amazon.com. The only place they honor a warranty from is an authorized store (read overpriced). I contacted their tech support and began to troubleshoot the phone. During the troubleshooting steps the phone completely crashed. IT IS TOAST! Unusable now. FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS. HTC will not repair the phone.

New or Refurbished - not sure,"I got this phone yesterday. This was an ATT HTC inspire phone which is unlocked, The phone overall looks/works in good shape for now, but there are certain aspects which concern me.- the VOID sticker which is present on my HTC inspire (which I had got directly from ATT is missing on this one). the void sticker is placed on 2 screws one under the battery and the other on the screw at the bottom left of the SIM card. This indicates that someone may have probably opened the phone for repair or other work. -Seller called me and informed HTC unlocked phones do not come with the VOID warranty stickers on the screws.(This is an HTC phone made for ATT which was unlocked and sold)- The 8 GB SD card which comes with the ATT HTC INSPIRE phone is missing. Which means I have to buy that from the amazon marketplace or run after the seller to send me one.

Better than my last phone,"My phone before this was the worst. I got this for $99, it was worth the money. I have T-Mobile and I was really scared that it wouldn't work because this phone got so many bad reviews on how it wouldn't read their sim cards. But it worked and I was relieved. The processing speed on this thing is okay, I hate how some of the apps can't be deleted like the stupid Blockbuster app. grrrSometimes out of nowhere, it would just freeze and I have to take out the battery to reboot it. I got the 32 gb card and it works just fine.When it came in, the screen protector was a little gross looking but functional. I would recommend you order a case, new screen protectors and the 32 gb card.All in all, good phone, very functional, very good priceUPDATE: DECEMBER 25, 2014In the past months that I bought this, it started screwing up on me. The camera wouldn't start up and when it did, it would shut down randomly. I don't have many apps and I clean it constantly with CCleaner, and it's still slow. It takes almost 30 seconds to leave an app. And as I am writing this, the keyboard is shorting out on me. This is the 6th time attempting to type this.It still freezes, and every time I restart my phone, it erases my T9 library. Every time I sync the screen to my touch, it gets erased as well. It's taking forever to open an app and even longer to close one. The cursor will move around when you're trying to type something important, like this update on my review.I spent the summer in Myrtle Beach and there were so many things photographic. The focus on the camera sucks, which led to many blurry pictures of nights out, days at the beach and morning runs. After the summer, I was left with dozens of blurry pictures with friends (most of whom I'll never see again as some were foreign. Euro babes, am I right?!) ;)No front facing camera and no camera button. Those would have been extremely in handy.Quality is bad too. In some pictures, I look red.Every time I plug it in to AUX cord, it randomly goes to voice recognition and starts calling people. The background setup is horrible, to get a good background you have to choose a wide picture.It gets little to no reception, and it doesn't help that I have T-Mobile. My friend has the HTC One with AT&amp;T and is having similar problems too.Reception will come and go. I can't even get one bar in my living room. My mom has an S5, and she has almost full bars wherever she goes(same carrier).I will never buy an HTC phone ever again. I'm saving to get an S5 and I STRONGLY SUGGEST you do the same. This wasn't worth all the frustration and anger. Samsung knows how to make a phone.This was a good phone at first but no, this processor CANNOT handle the apps of today. Strange that that this phone came out 4 years ago, it's way slower than my previous one which came out in 2006.As much as this phone sucks, it can really take a punch, literally. It's hardy enough for that. That is how frustrating this has been for me, and I'm a really laid back person.I should have listened to the reviewers who had this phone before me. There were so many mixed reviews and I took a shot and bought this anyway. How I regret it so. Save yourself the trouble. The cheapest S5 I've seen was $475 and oh, it will be so worth the money. I'm glad I only paid $99 for this. I've bought used electronics before, and they all still work like they're brand new, except this crap phone.When I get my S5, I'm not even going to donate this phone, I'm not that evil. No, I plan on setting it afire.SKIP THIS HORRIBLE MONSTROSITY OF A PHONE AND GET YOURSELF A SAMSUNG S5! OR AN IPHONE! DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!",2014年1月12日 在美国审核
"Beware old phones on sale as ""new""","The phone died within 3 weeks of purchase, sent back phone to seller who replaced the battery and sent the phone back to me only for the phone to die again within2 weeks. I attempted to return the phone but this time the seller started accusing me of initially returning a ""heavily damaged"" phone and rejecting the same phone they were offering to take back a restocking fee of $35 for failing to return the charger. The phone at this time was and still is as intact as they had sold it to me and I was surprised at this turn of events. I was told to complain to whichever department I felt was necessary and implied that they did not care whether I did business with them or not.

BE WEARY OF BUYING FROM THEM,"My fiance needed a new cell phone that was unlocked to use with his current provider. I will admit that it arrived brand new, as described unlocked and all and he had no problems initially with the phone or his provider switching his service to the phone. The apps and storage were an upgrade from the phone he had previously and seemed at first to work very well.However the phone is now 3 months old and barely works. The speakers on the phone are not that great first off, if you speak too loudly or there are loud noises the speakers make it very hard to hear the person you are speaking to and for them to hear you as well. The touch screen from about the middle down is non responsive, which is a problem due to the keyboard and all other functions for the most part being located on the touchscreen. Making it difficult to use the phone for even the most basic functions. Calls are often dropped (which may have a lot to do with service provider rather than phone) and sometimes calls do not always come through also a possible provider issue.All in all had the phone continued to work as described we would be pleased since it was brand new and we paid over $120 for it. It is a good phone with the features as described it just didn't last long for our purchase therefore my advice is to be weary of products from this seller.",2014年6月20日 在美国审核

Beautiful screen - 4.3"" is a perfect size, clear and sharp2. Camera - 8MP is amazing and very high quality3. Processor - only had one freeze once and it was completely my fault (the app turned out to be fake/defective/possible virus)4. Great Call Quality5. Aluminium body - Compared to my friend's phones my Inspire feels top quality!The metal feels nice in the hand and the battery cover and SD card slot are rubberized so that it does not slip.I still got a case so that the precious thing does not slip out of my hand!6. Everything!7. It updates to Android 2.3, may eventually update to 4.0, unknown so farCons:1. Battery Life - with nothing installed on this phone, and my heavy use, the battery will drain about 20% or more in one hour, and others who have it say the same thing.I then got the Ultimate Juice Defender app, and so far, sooooo good!I have been able to have my phone get less then 1% gone in an hour of standby!I also save a TON of data usage, another plus (save me some money!)2.

The best smartphone I have ever seen,"Before buying this mobile phone, I was reading lots of reviews and watching lots of video comparisons among several smartphones, and many of them lead me towards the HTC Inspire 4G. I was a little worried though, thinking that it might not work here in Peru. But everything's been perfect since I received it. I simply love this smartphone. Although it's bigger than the average, it's stylish, really beautiful, and the huge screen is awesome. Apart from that, its graphical user interface, HTC Sense, is the best have seen in many smartphones, including Motorolas, Iphones and Blackberrys.Apart from all this, as the sound quality is extremely important to me, this topic deserves a special mention. Although the quality of its speaker is not really impressive, the quality of the sound is the best of the best when listening with earphones and turning on the Dolby Mobile option. It's simply fantastic. Ah, did you know that only 4 smartphones include the Dolby technology, and one of them is the HTC Inspire?About the internet, the navigation speed is also remarkable. It's much faster than the Blackberry Torch, and as it comes with Flash, you won't notice any difference with looking at web pages in a laptop / desktop PC.If you are hesitating between this phone and the Blackberry Torch, let me tell you my own experience: just the day I got my HTC Inspire, my sister received a brand new Blackberry Torch, and I have been comparing them both ever since. The only thing that is better in the Torch is the quality of the screen (it seems that the pixel density is higher in the Torch), but in the rest the HTC Inspire beat it up.Thus I highly recommend this phone, definitely you will never regret.",2011年12月21日 在美国审核

Good Phone,"The phone that came in was new in non-carrier packaging, although when started up its obviously a at&amp;t branded phone. Because of this the tethering and a couple other apps are locked down unless you have a at&amp;t account to unlock the features with. I'm sure there is a way around this but have not found it yet. It was already unlocked out of the box. I was easily able to upgrade it to 2.3(gingerbread)from 2.2 using the HTC sync software. The ui take some getting used to if your used to a vanilla android ui and can be frustrating at times. I removed most of the widgets from the home screen except for the clock and turned off background sync off on most of the apps. After doing this the battery seems to do pretty good. The call sound is pretty good and the speaker phone works well. It had good audio quality when playing or streaming music. The phone is pretty snappy even when running apps that are in the background. Unlike other reviewers I haven't had trouble removing the doors for access to the sim card or the battery. These doors are used for the wifi and cell service antennas so they need to be on when in use. It has good picture quality for a phone it is sensitive to movement when taking the pictures. It has a dual flash which also works great for the built in flashlight app. It has a fm radio tuner built in but it uses the ear buds as a antenna so you can't listen to the radio with bluetooth headphones. There are quite a few features that are part of the sense ui, there is also some issues for those that are not used to it. The features are too many too list but can be found on the HTC website. The 3G works on the at&amp;t network just fine. One of the drawbacks with this phone is that the battery slides into a slot so you cannot use those extended batteries that come with a different backpiece like you can with other phones. It also makes the battery slightly a pain to get out as you have to slap the phone against your hand to get the battery to slide out. Despite the shortcomings I have been very happy with this phone.",2012年2月26日 在美国审核
My first android,"This is my first smart phone. I had an itouch but never had a real smart phone before. I do not like contract phones so I purchased this unlocked refurbished condition. Its been 3 months now and no problems as of yet.As far as looks are concerned, I dont think it has anything spectacular in that. For most of the HTCs, their big screen is the only attractive thing about it. Touch interface is very impressive although it freezes for a couple of seconds once in a month. Android app store is superb. Had android 2.3(gingerbread on it) so thats a big plus. You can definitely feel the difference if you have used 2.1 previously.No complaints about battery life. I can generally carry on a full day without going below 20% battery. But ofcourse this depends on your battery usage. I have a moderate usage.It froze once completely. That it is to say it wasnt working at all. But it came back to normal after safe reboot (power + up volume) Then I realized it had happened because of incompatible apps. Some of the apps are not meant for android 2.3 and if you try to force them on this one, it may end up freezing your phone.Camera is great. Its 8MP autofocus (its not just on paper, it does it really well and quickly) My friends say iphone gets better pictures with 5MP but I dont think so. Its definitely at par with iphone for photo quality if not better than it. You will miss the front camera a lot though if you are avid user of video chatting clients.In short, as far as system stability and interface, it still needs improvement to compete with iphone. But its very cost effective as compared to iphone($230 unlocked as compared to $600 for iphone) I liked the big screen that doesnt compromise on its battery life. I like the customization capability of android over the iOS. I will definitely recommend this phone if you wanna try something other than iphone.",2012年4月17日 在美国审核
A great phone for everyday use.,"I got this phone as a replacement for my old Nokia, and so far, everything was great. The initial setup went very quickly and easily. I was able to easily transfer all of my old contacts over to the new phone via BlueTooth, so I did not need to copy all of the contacts by hand.Although the Android OS is the fairly old 2.3 version, it is configured with HTC sense to add a better interface.The 8 MP camera is great, it creates well focused high resolution pictures that you can easily move to your computer.Overall, I am very impressed by this product, and now it is a tool that I cannot live a day without.",2012年8月13日 在美国审核

However, I should have done a ""little"" more research on this phone.The phone is ok, but the HTC Sense launcher that is installed, is a joke.I changed the default wallpaper to a different one (already installed on phone) and it locked the phone up.It kept freezing at least 3 to 4 times a day.After doing some research, I had to set the wallpaper and settings to ""default"" which helped this problem.It locks up every other day it seems, but other than that it works ok.Camera is awesome, and the size is great.",2013年3月21日 在美国审核
Not great but not that bad,"The phose has a lot of capacities.Several issues I had (and have):- It is indeed an unlocked phone. You can use it to call and tx msg. To use internet you have to change some datas manually. I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that. But you won't be able to use the 4G even if your sim card is AT&amp;T. You need a plan for that. This is something you should be aware of! Don't buy this phone for it's 4G: it won't work!- An huge issue that I had: the phone was freezing ALL THE TIME - it was crazy.... But I read about it on internet, and this issue seems to be pretty common with this phone. A solution exist: to download Launcher Ex. I don't use the htc sense anymore but the launcher and I never had this problem anymore. The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...- An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory. This is something that really bother me because I have the phone for more or less 1 or 2 month and the phone memory is already half full and my SD card is almost empty and there is nothing I can do about that! Also, the fact that you have to move each application manually from the phone memory to the SD card each time you download an application is annoying too... it should be automatic!!!If you can deal with this issues then the phone is fine. I am still happy about this phone because I really needed an unlocked phone (because I travel all the time - even if i have no idea yet if it is going to work with a foreign sim card...), that goes on internet!Also if you live in the USA, many prepaid plan are available that are not very expensive and would let you do most of the things you need...So overall: it is not a bad deal and it is the price to pay to be free and not stuck with a 2 years plan!",2013年4月1日 在美国审核

Casing flimsy - Battery BAD,I had read a review on this phone that said the battery was no good. But I did not take heed of this fowarning. Because others said their phone was good. So I bought it anyway hoping I would get a good one. I received my phone in the mail a few days before I left the states to take it to my fiance in St Lucia. So when I got there we discovered that the battery was no good. We had to order &amp; pay for another battery from a store in St Lucia. So now it works fine however the casing is very very flimsy. you have to be very very careful when you take the cover off to put in the SIM card or you will bend the casing and it will break easy. Take your time in taking off the cover for the battery also it is hard to remove. You can do video calls on this phone but it does not have a front facing camera so you have to turn the phone to the backside so the person you are talking to can see you.What a disappointment because the main purpose for buying the phone was to save money on international calls by using Skype or other free video calls.:-(,2013年12月18日 在美国审核

Some other times while my Sony Xperia shows 4 bars with lte, This HTC will show no bars or 1 bar with E.I don't know if this is a phone hardware issue or it is due to the fact it was anAT&amp;T instrument and subsquently unlocked.

HTC,I bought this cell phone last year as a gift for one of my friends. I was for a short trip in the United States and when I received the phone I went back home and gave the phone to my friend. After he turned the phone on we noticed these problems:1. The phone mic which was supposed to transfer the voice to call receiver didn't work.2. Every 5 minutes the operating system kept hanging.3. There were huge touch problems which made my friend reset his cell phone every 30 minutes.4. In a nutshell it was a real either fake one or second-hand item.The big problem was that I was not able to get back to States till this June.Since then I hate to buy any HTC cell phones and I don't recommend buying a cell phone online.,2014年6月11日 在美国审核

However, I live in the Bahamas and, needles to say, the phone does not serve the purpose for which I bought it. My phone provider cannot un-do the block that AT&amp;T has on in.

Excellent Product,My sister brought this phone from America last week and gave me as a gift. I was pretty excited by looking at the large touch screen and awesome apps. I am using it in Pakistan with SIM of Telenor GSM service provider and its working perfectly fine.

Battery life is a bit point of concern and you need to charge it once in 24 hours.2. You need a SD card otherwise few apps will not work. e.g its internal battery cant support few apps (Games) and even the camera pics3.

Love this phone,"Its a nice phone. My old one had such a small screen. Now I can see the time lol, and my big thumbs don't fumble up my texts anymore because the keyboard tabs are big enough.

HTC Inspire,"This phone has one of the biggest screens on the market right now, which is great if you surf the web mainly on your phone. 5 stars there. It's also my first smart phone I've owned, and I'm pretty biased towards the Android market; I have no plans of ever owning an iPhone. With that said, there are a few minor things that I have no doubt HTC will be able to upgrade in the future.-Sometimes, when I attempt to type a new url in the browser, instead of the ""enter"" triangle-shaped button, it gives me the refresh button and i literally cannot go to the new website. But this isn't every time.-Occasionally, some of the apps, although useful, can cause a buildup of spam on your app drawer(at the top of the screen). The ones I normally see are stars and the only way to delete them is to rid of the app itself.-For some reason, although I have all of my contacts from facebook on my phone, many of their profile pictures wont show up beside their name or pop up when they call. This isn't really a big deal to me but for some people it could be, I suppose.-And of course....the battery life is pretty terrible. I've gone an entire day without touching it and come back at the end of the day and its in the yellow. I have the auto updates turned off and kill programs and it remains to drain, but for what this phone is capable of, I really am impressed. We are in the primal stages of this insane technology, folks.-Sometimes having multiple programs running can in fact cause the phone to freeze and the only solution is to remove the battery. Easier said then done if you have a hard plastic case like I did, until I had to remove it so many times to get to the battery.- My internet occasionally just stops working, no matter if I'm at my rural house or in the city where I work. I have at&amp;t by the way. There is a slight chance it's the provider....not sure.-The camera is capable of taking breath taking pictures, it's the equivalent of having a digital camera in itself. But on occasion the pictures will simply turn out blurry for 7-10 shots before they return to normal clarity. I have yet to figure out this reason.-Removing the battery can cause panic for some because I've found that your pictures, videos and music will vanish and the only way to make them visible is to remove the battery AND restart your phone. So if this happens to you, don't panic.-Finally, there are many fantastic apps you can get for these phones and it's far less restricted from apple's market from what I understand. But, unbeknownst to me, some apps can cause blockers. By blockers I mean that when it's time for your phone to do a system update, these apps can block the update from occurring. I wish I knew which apps caused it. =(ALL of that being said, this phone has it quirks but honestly, I don't regret buying it, I got a good deal on it and it has really helped launch me into the ""smart"" world. The Google Play market is perfection, the speed of downloading apps is pretty remarkable, too. And there are many handy things this device is capable of despite the kinks, and I look forward to what HTC and Android will have for us in the future.",2012年10月11日 在美国审核
Good phone,"So far so good. Coming from an older style phone this is great. I connected it with Platinum tel and it works, the cheapest pay as you go company. The phone being unlocked is a big plus.

Generally good transition for this ex-Apple-phone user,"After four years of Apple phones, I started using this unlocked phone two weeks ago.In general, I really like it.The contact import (via Bluetooth) went really well and it was easy to use straight out of the box.It is a lot faster than the 3GS that I replaced.The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is some of the adjustments I wanted to make took time.For example, the software added Facebook-based birthdays to the calendar and I didn't want that.And I didn't want a notification for every email.In all of these cases, a Google search eventually taught how to modify the system but it took time.I find Apple's approach to settings to be more intuitive.As for the battery, it took time for me to learn that turning off auto-sync gives you LOTS of extra battery life.But rather than a having a general fetch email option, one hits the gmail application, the menu and the refresh option (with auto-sync disabled) to fetch email on your command.Again, somewhat less intuitive than what I was used too.I cannot verify if the phone was fully unlocked because I transferred an AT&amp;T SIM card.I can tell you that I got a couple of messages from AT&amp;T asking that if I now have a 4G phone, I should contact them regarding a 4G plan.But the spirit of unlocked compels me not too ...",2011年11月18日 在美国审核

Battery life is decent; quite different from the opinion that I find here. It lasts easily for a day despite my heavy game playing habit. Picture quality is also good. Brightness of the screen is an issue in sunlight. But finally after 6 months of struggle with the speaker and the sound quality, the phone is dead.

Mailed me three times back and forth and still had flaws!!!,"Sep 21 I ordered for the first time, Sep 27 arrived a used and broken one. I mailed back and required a new one, and the customer service contacted me only when i wrote review for them through amazon. Oct 3 arrived the second one which could never be fully charged after 8 hours charging. Also the 8G MicroSD card was missing. I mailed them back again and wrote a review on amazon. The customer service person asked me to delete my review and promised me they would send me a new phone with 8G MicroSD card as soon as possible. But they just gave me an empty tracking number and kept me waiting. Finally on Oct15 the last phone came but it was 5 days later then showed on the empty tracking number and they only gave me a 4G card!!!!! I could not believe this! After a month waiting and wasting my time on negotiating with them, while missing a lot of phones/ text and paying for my phone plan, I payed a lot to trust them again and again. So I askd them for an 30% amount of refund, which is resonable for any other companies I ever bought stuff at. But the costumer service who contacted me for a month said she could not handle this amount and forwarded my case to a bigger manager. And it has been a month now no one replys me!!!!!!

"Very Beautiful Smartphone, Please Readon for Many Details","I owned this phone for about a year and loved it. However, I upgrade my phones often as I am a techie and have to have the latest phone/tablet, etc. Here is my detailed review, and I hope that it will help you make a good decision if you need a great smartphone at this great price!Pros:- Very clear and easy to read 4.3"" screen.- Outstanding colors with clear and vivid screen.- 2.2 Android allowed me to save many installed apps on my SD External card. (Cannot do this anymore after OS 3.0 and higher).- Great camera - I took many high quality pictures and many were better than my regular camera.- Music Player (stock) is very good. Sound could be louder, however, a good set of headphones fixed this and the sound is good with the headset.- Got 4g on the Internet Data.- WiFi came in clear and fast.- Overall a easy to use and good sized 4.3"" phone and it is a little heavy, yet still comfortable to hold with big enough screen.- Built in FM Radio. This is one of my favorite features!- Good memory and this phone was fast and peppy for me.- Excellent Internal storage space. **Also many apps that I installed I was able to move onto my External SD card because the OS in this phone is 2.2. After OS 3.0 and above, apps cannot be moved onto the SD card, so this is a plus for this phone.Cons:- Do not like that the back has two separate compartments for battery and Sim card, memory card, a hassle to open this up, but I got used to it.- HEAVY PHONE for it's size!- Phone kind of thick (at least by today's standards).In spite of the cons, I still give it a 4.6 as it is a good phone even for today!Also, I am a techie and know a lot about Android devices that is smartphones and tablets, so if you have any questions, please ask me in the comment section.Hope that this review has been helpful to you and thank you for reading it.",2013年5月1日 在美国审核

Overall excellent phone,"Overall I am very pleased with this phone. I purchased an HTC phone because I had the HTC Incredible and loved it and I wanted to stay with the same user interface. The only reason I purchased a new phone is that I am leaving Verizon and going to Straight Talk and they require a GSM phone.There have been some reviews indicating that this phone does not work with prepaid carriers but my experience setting this up with Straight Talk has been flawless. You just need to make sure that you purchase an ATT SIM card from Straight Talk's website (Straight Talk uses ATT's towers for this and most other phones). And overall I am also very pleased with Straight Talk both on price and coverage.I have also read some reviews, both on Amazon and other websites, that indicate the HTC Inspire has poor reception. At first I thought the same thing. But then I realized that the antenna for this phone is actually part of the SIM card cover. I don't know why they did this but if you are having reception issues make sure that the SIM card cover (bottom of phone) is securely and tightly fitted onto the phone. In addition you may need to clean the 2 copper electrodes on the cover and the phone to ensure that you have a good connection.The only reason for a 4 instead of a 5 star is that the manufacturer's box that this phone came in was not in new condition. It had been opened and not handled with care. I assume they have to open the box to ""unlock"" it from ATT but the box looks to be a year old and dropped a few times. In addition the 8GB SD card was not included as advertised. Not a huge deal for me since they only cost $6 and I had already planned to buy a 16 GB but I wanted to mention this.Overall I am very pleased with my HTC Inspire. Amazon had excellent and fast delivery as always (fulfilled by Amazon). I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for an unlocked GSM phone for use with Straight Talk or other potential prepaid (better value) services.",2013年1月12日 在美国审核

Awesome phone!,"I always thought that iPhone is top of the game - I mean, Apple products usually are, right?Well, I was looking for a gift for my wife's birthday and I really didn't like price of unlocked iPhone. I'm not US citizen so I can't get it through contract, so my only option was to buy it for full price and lets be honest - it's greatly exaggerated. So, I opted to instead switch to Android phone. Woooooooooow! Hello thar! :)It took me awhile to choose which phone to buy and in the end, Inspire won with it's easily affordable price. Seriously, you can buy 2 of these for a price of 1 iPhone! And that is actually what I did - I bought one, used it for a week and went back to Amazon to order another one for my wife as the 1st one is staying with me.Lets be honest, though - phone is not perfect. Yeah, battery could be stronger (get yourself 1600 mAh or stronger one for roughly $10), software could be slightly more polished but in all honesty, this is a 5 star phone.PROs:* HUGE screen! And with high resolution, wow!* Easy to customize (software and hardware [i.e. stronger battery]). Take that, iPhone!* PRICE! Did I mention that you can buy 2 of these for the price of 1 iPhone? Seriously? Steve, you've been awesome guy, may you rest in peace, but your products have been greatly overpriced.* 8 MP camera! (not the best quality but surprisingly good)CONs:* Software could be slightly better. It does have some weird stuff going on, but nothing to tarnish this phone's great rep.* BIG! Seriously, forget about carrying it in your pocket. This is mini tablet, I kid you not. I still love it. :)For me, this is easy decision - this phone trumps anything else in the market when it comes to price/specs ratio. Yeah I know, everybody wants iPhone 4s, Samsung Galaxy S2 etc, but seriously, they can't really offer you much more considering huge price gap between them and this phone.I know I bought 2 for reason. Trust me, this phone rocks.",2011年10月23日 在美国审核
Excellent - Great,"I have it for two weeks and has been excellent.Everything described in the description of the phone is what I saw.An excellent phone, from applications to the release has been wonderful.I recommend it.The only downside is the length of the battery, but I bought two extra batteries and I'm always the data cable and thus the charge into any USB port, so the problem is resolved.Thanks and greetings from Costa Rica",2011年8月11日 在美国审核
Buyers BEWARE!!! Do NOT purchase from this seller,"I was very excited when I got this device, but after start using it, I got very disappointed. This phone was listed as NEW but it was obvious that it was a refubished phone. Additionally, I only received the phone, battery, and charger, NO MicroSD memory card or microphone/earphone were received with the shipment. I had to have a charger constantly on me to get through the day. The phone froze up constantly, making me have to remove the battery and insert it again in order to make it boot up again, the camara doesn't work and almost all programs foreclose. I live in Venezuela so I can't return this product. I hope it helps future buyers to think twice before getting this phone. Bad experience for me.",2013年2月15日 在美国审核

superior amazon service.,"I had read all the negative reviews for this phone but the good ones out weighed the bad so I decided to give it a go. The unit I was sent was defective out of the box and I remembered all the people advising against it. I contacted amazon and they immediately sent out a new phone and gave me a ups label to return the defective one @ no extra cost. The second phone has been working perfectly and amazon's superior customer service took some of the sting off of getting a non working unit the first time. On an additional note, all those warnings of poor battery life, I've gotten the battery so far to go 36 to 40 hours btwn charges. over all it has been worth the price, just be sure to buy from amazon directly as you will then have the their guaranty backing you up.",2011年10月9日 在美国审核

Great phone from a good company.,"I would recommend the HTC Inspire (or Desire as it is called outside the US). I have had this phone for two years now. I have been very happy with it as well. About a year ago, mine broke while working (I'm a firefighter/paramedic, and I forgot to take it out of my pocket prior to going on a call), and I did not have a second thought about buying the same one again. The phone comes with the standard smartphone options, such as wifi, gps, 4g &amp; 4g support as well.The phone has a great stock ROM that is one of the best for Android based phones. The ROM is well put together with the appropriate options for the common user. Most Android apps work for this ROM as well, although the stock ROM was unable to run Google Chrome.The battery life is about standard for a smart phone, and does seem to require to be charged twice a day for the amount I use my phone. I should note I use my phone as my morning newspaper and read the news for about an hour every morning, and I also use it for my job, looking up medical information and extrication manuals for rare cars (hybrids, ect). So it gets pretty heavy use, and two charges a day when I am in my vehicle or at my desk seems to work out well. If you play games, it will drain the battery very quickly, though.The phone comes with an 8 megapixel camera, wish is good for casual photography. I wouldn't recommend it for any serious photography, but it works good for taking pictures of my family, pets, ect. I also use it to document certain things in my job, such as car accident photos, or during fire investigation.The GPS does leave something to be desired, as I often cannot get a signal. I am unsure if this is due to the phone itself, or the function of the satellites and where I live.The HTC Inspire is a good media phone. It can play CPU hungry games, although it does quickly drain the battery and the phone does get hot while playing anything more graphically intense then Angry Birds. The phone comes with an 8gb sd card for storage of photos, games, music, ect. This can be replaced with a larger sd card, up to 32gb, which is great if you use your phone as an MP3 player as I do.The Inspire is not without faults, but it is a great phone, and can be easily modified through rooting as well. I would recommend the phone for anyone from casual user up to those that love their gadgets. It is all around a good phone.",2012年11月26日 在美国审核
Great phone but slightly outdated.,"I just recently replaced this phone after having it for nearly 4 years and it still works great!I tried to see if I could keep it but due to having to sign a new contract it didn't cost me anything to upgrade.This thing is DURABLE!One of my favorite features about this phone is that it has a full aluminum unibody, in other words the sides, top and bottom of the phone are all one piece.I dropped this phone countless time in the 44 months I used it with little to no damage.Towards the end I did get a very small crack in the corner of the screen (which didn't protrude into the viewing area).It also started to get some light scratching on the screen as I never used a screen protector.While the hardware is antiquated by today's standards it is very snappy for all tasks I used it for.The 8mp camera takes very clear and crisp photos.Battery life for me is still great, except for when it is searching for a signal,at work I do not have cell signal and this phone with 100% charge would drain it self completely in a matter of 3-4 hours.My only real complaint is the outdated version of android this phone has on it.Within the past 4-6 months my banking apps on the phone stopped working as software stopped supporting this version of android.I really am not an ""app"" person so this didn't effect me too much other than the above mentioned banking apps.",2015年1月27日 在美国审核
I wish it worked.,"This could be such an excellent phone. It has lots of RAM, a fast processor, and a great camera in good lighting.I've owned three HTC Inspires in less than 9 months. I never dropped a single one, and took great care of them. After 7 months, not a single scratch could be seen on my phone.Inspire #1: Fine, except the proximity sensor never worked, causing me to accidentally hang up on calls when the screen didn't turn off. One day, the volume rocker just fell out. I can't explain it. I was adjusting the volume on Spotify and the plastic volume rocker just...fell out of the phone, and it's difficult to replace.-Called AT&amp;T - got a replacement.Inspire #2: Great phone for a week. Volume down was sticky and didn't always register properly. Dealt with it for two weeks and definitely couldn't live with it for another 1.2 years.-Called AT&amp;T - got a replacement.Inspire #3: Major antenna issues. Misses about 50% of the calls it is supposed to recieve. The AT&amp;T tower is about 1 mile from my house - on a mountain, and I'm directly line-of-sight to it. Sometimes the phone will show zero bars. Sometimes full bars. Sometimes it just misses a call. Yes, the back cover is on - and it was the same one from the previous two, which never missed a call.Thinking this issue was software-related, I flashed to Cyanogenmod and installed a new radio. And despite completely replacing the phone's original ROM, the problem persisted. Still missed about 50% of the calls. I wound up using a SIP provider with free incoming calls, routed missed calls to Google Voice, which then rang the SIP client on my phone. Needless to say, about 4 out of 10 calls I recieve wind up coming through the VoIP line - which means it missed the original call. The funny thing? VoIP rings over 3G, which means the phone just has an issue with calls - not data.So, after dealing with three HTC Inspire phones, they are truly terrible, poorly-manufactured devices. I will never buy an HTC product again. I've given them three chances, and they've failed on every single one.Never again, HTC. Never again.",2012年7月15日 在美国审核
Great Phone,"I have owned this phone since 2011 when it first came out and I've never had any trouble with it.On the contrary, it is just far more intuitive than any other phone I've handled.The sounds are the coolest.I will transfer all of its sounds the first chance I get.I can't believe LG's awful noises nor the pricetag.However, the sounds on this HTC were inspired.So cool, every one.I have it loaded with applications that I don't need and a 32 gb chip, and they all work and nothing crashes the phone.My LG crashed a month ago and caused a lot of trouble for me.I will switch back to HTC next chance I get.I had considered getting another Inspire or a Desire for a friend but it is now a bit tricky to find apps for Android 2.3.3.This Inspire is supposed to be upgradeable to 4.0 but I have no proof of this personally.I should attempt this.If I could do this I certainly would. I still love its interface to android.HTC Sense I think it's called.So intuitive.I still have trouble figuring out my LG I've had for years but this HTC thinks like I do.If there were a modern version I'd buy it and of course there are many.I don't know how they differ from this model in particular.I just know that I will still turn my inspire on occasionally for various needs because it works.",2014年5月23日 在美国审核
"Odd man out, but I think for the money it is a really good phone.","Unlike the majority of bad reviews, I actually really loved this phone.The camera is amazing and although it does not have a front camera that people like so much to take selfies, I just aim in the general direction and hit the camera button and selfies come out just fine.I got my phone from AT&amp;T under contract, however I went online and downloaded a file and a couple apps that unlocked my phone for free.The downside is definitely the battery life.I actually purchased a couple batteries and a charger so that when I knew I was going to be unable to charge my phone, I would bring my spare batteries, charged and ready to go.That tripled my battery time.I used the phone for several years with no problems until it would no longer charge when I plugged it in.I took it to a phone repair store and the guy told me that it would be about $80 and he said that more than likely it would stop charging again in the future and didn't recommend it.Since I had extra batteries and a battery charger, that worked alright.Just a pain in the butt.I think for the money, this is a good phone with plenty of good features.I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 now which makes every other phone I've had seem like a kid's version.I can only imagine what the S5 is like.",2014年6月25日 在美国审核
Great phone...with a few flaws,"I've had my HTC Inspire for almost two years now, and for the most part, I like it very much.The layout is user-friendly--it's easy to get from the main menu to apps to the phone features, and it allows you to pick your favorite apps for the main menu.I can listen to Pandora or FM radio while doing other things.The touchscreen is about as good as you can expect for a phone; there's only so much room you have to hit each key, and there are arrow keys that allow you to weave through emails or text messages.The online features allow for four windows to be opened at once, and it's easy to navigate and use the finger-pinch movement to zoom in or out of a page.When opening a video, the video automatically fills the page--no zooming in required.The clock is big and bold; it shows the weather...most things that are typical of a good smartphone.A few downsides that I hope are fixed on newer models--the battery cover is a PAIN to remove.I've actually hurt myself trying to get this thing off, and had to watch a YouTube tutorial to figure it out (take a fingernail or sharp object and carefully shimmy it into the corner NEXT TO the indention--be careful or you can hurt yourself!).The battery is so-so--you have to charge it every night but sometimes the battery will last great all day and then others, it's down to yellow before dinner, and there are no more programs running on it than any other day.The SIM card has to be in the case just-so and has a tendency to slip out of position from time-to-time.Not a big problem--just something to be aware of.And sometimes when typing online, the keyboard will pop up and the online screem will move in such a position that I can't see what I'm typing (this is especially bad with email).The sound quality, for the most part, is good, but if you're listening to Whitney Houston when she hits those higher octaves...it can overwhelm the volume and make a squeaky noise through the headphones.All that being said, the minor flaws are outweighed by everything else.It's a good phone with a lot of features and some flaws.I would recommend it but be aware of some imperfections.",2013年10月4日 在美国审核
The best phone by far!!,"I have had this phone for 5 months, and it is by far the best phone I have ever had. I have owned a very many phones over a period of 17 years. Not only did I fall in love with android, but I fell in love with HTC. I was a little leary about getting a phone I knew nothing about, but I trusted my at&amp;t sales rep and bought it. I have had almost no problems with it. I have way to many pictures and text messages on it and it causes it to freeze up sometimes but not much(which can be expected with so much space taken up). I usually just restart it and it is fine. Every so often I go through and delete things to give it a little bit of a break lol. I have never loved a phone as much as I love this one. I have dropped it on my ceramic tile in my kitchen and bathroom and it didn't even have so much as a scratch on it. I also dropped it on my concrete steps in my garage and again nothing happened to it. I have to say if you are going to get a smart phone (or any phone for that matter) this is the one to get. It has an 8MP camera which is awesome and the color is so vibrant I can hardly stand looking or using anyone else's phone. I have to say this phone has me spoiled. When it comes time to upgrade I will get another HTC phone. Also if you lose your phone you can download an app called android lost from your computer to your phone. It will send you the last messages sent and received, phone calls, take a picture from your phone, send crazy loud ""help me I'm lost"" messages (the phone can be on silent and it still plays it loud), you can set the phone to lock up and notify you if a different sim card is inserted, and many more great things to find your phone. On top of all those things it gives you a gps location within 7 meters of where your phone is. Trust me it works. My phone was stolen and I used this app and it had an arrow directly on the house where the phone was. All of this is emailed to you and the person with your phone has no idea any of this is going on. Awesome phone I highly recommend it to everyone!!!",2011年12月15日 在美国审核
"Solid phone, a few nitpicks","This phone has great specs for most users who do not need the latest, fastest, dual-core hype.I am very happy with this phone for reasons others have mentioned.There are only a few downsides:1. battery door design is poor;difficult for most folks toopen.2. battery is probably undersized for the stock ROM and for high speed data.I run CyanogenMod 7.2.0 on this device with the TalonACE CFS kernel which results in good battery life.I lose about 1%/hour battery when the phone is allowed to sleep.But if you are running the stock ROM, gaming, or facebooking all day you'll want to keep a charger with you.3. I'd prefer the volume and power buttons stuck up a bit higher with a more positive feel.Be aware that just because a phone is unlocked and usable on any GSM network it doesn't necessarily mean you will get high-speed data on all services.On T-Mobile, for example, the frequencies needed for 3/4g are absent so you will be only on 2g.I'm on wifi most of the time so this does not affect me.",2012年6月26日 在美国审核
Worst cell phone I've ever owned,"I was excited to try an Android phone when I got this, but I've had too many problems with it to give a good review. The first thing I noticed is that the battery life is terrible. This phone doesn't last through the day without charging, and it gets worse the longer you own it. I've had it for a little over a year now, and I can't use it even for something simple--like reading on the Kindle app--without it going dead after about 30 minutes' use. This is after shutting down Wi-Fi, changing the connection settings to preserve battery life, and keeping the screen dimmer than I prefer. Forget connecting to Wi-Fi, as you'll get about 5 minutes with that. A friend who was having the same problem with her Inspire suggested I download a task killer to save on battery, which I did. Every time I open it, I find the phone is running about 15 apps in the background, most of them apps that came pre-loaded on the phone, apps that I NEVER use and that I can't get rid of. This is all just frustrating. The reception is also garbage. My husband and I are both on AT&amp;T, and his iPhone works in many places this phone doesn't. Thus, it's not the network; it's the phone. Also, ever since they sent a software update (just a short while after I bought this lemon) I've had trouble with texting. Whenever I try to hit the back button to correct a typing mistake, it kicks me out of my text and pulls up a screen for deleting text strings, forcing me to quit the text function altogether, exit and reopen the program to finish my message. Makes texting a drag. Lastly, this phone freezes up regularly. I mean freezing as in the thing gets stuck trying to complete a task, and I can't even shut it down with the power button. I have to pull off the side cover to reset it. Overall, this is a terrible phone. I wouldn't recommend HTC to anyone I like, and I'll never buy one again.",2012年9月20日 在美国审核
Never ever buy this phone!!!!!!!!!!,Ok i just wanted to warn anyone that is considering buying this phone....Htc is having issues with this phone. I was told this my a customer service rep through AT&amp;T i am now about to receive my fourth one of these.. The first one would speed up my music and make it skip songs where you only heard 6 seconds of the song and they would sound like chimpmunks.Also this one if you were on the lock screen it took you about five minutes to unlock it because it didnt respond to touch. The second phone of this would not let me use my data and would show that i had no signal and i know i did because i was standing beside someone with the exact same phone and they had signal and i didnt. It would give me error messages when I tried to send a text message too when i did have signal. My third one i just got today would tell me that application that runs the phone has an error and i can force close or tell htc if you selected either it would pop up again and then the screen would completely go black. They are now sending me a fourth one...i wish i had never had this phone ever....the phone is great...when it actually works...I also know that this phone was recalled from walmart because i work with the cell phones there,2012年7月17日 在美国审核

HTC :- Worst Customer Service and Phone,"I got HTC Inspire July 2011 and after using for 14 months, it died. It was not charging up and I called up HTC and they asked me to send my device for repair. Now when I talked to the customer service they asked me the date of purchase and said that although the date of manufacturing is already passed out of warranty (it was May 2011), you will still have the warranty because you purchased the device on July 2011 from ATnT store. This is the way it should be. The warranty should start from the date of purchase rather than the actual manufacturing date when HTC sold the device to ATnT.First they requested to submit the proof of purchase. I faxed them (they don't have a facility where I can just scan and email them which is a very big pain because you don't know if at all they received the fax until somebody confirms it). After 2 days customer care person said that they received the proof of purcahse (my ATnT bill with date). They also confirmed that my phone is in the warranty and I can send in my phone.I sent my phone and after 3 days of the delivery confirmation, I got an update that my device is out of warranty. When I called them, they said that they have all the proof but they have to submit it to repair department and repair department will give me a call In 5 to 10 days (now see this, before sending the phone they said that complete process will take just 2 weeks right from sending the device to receiving it after repair).So even after discussing with 2 different customer care executives, now again I am waiting for the repair department call and again I have to repeat myself to convince them that device is in warranty. What a pathetic service? First of all their phone died in just 14 months and now they are not even readily accepting it to repair in warranty? It is showing that I have to pay whopping 180 bucks to get my phone repaired. This is absolutely frustrating.I used to love HTC phones, I even liked HTC One X but now I will never go with HTC again. Problems can happen with any phone but at least they should acknowledge that and accept the liability readily rather than making their customers go running around and explaining that their phone is in warranty.UPDATE:- After arguing with the customer care executive for 15-20 minutes and asking him to talk to his supervisor, finally I got my phone repaired without any charge.

problems with this product,I bought this phone about a year ago. Within 3 weeks it stopped working. I replaced it under warrenty. I went about seven months with no real issues at all. Then the voice dialer kept breaking unto whatever application I was using and scrambleing the application. I had never activated this application. I was told I could not deactivate it because it was hard wired into the phone. A factory reset did not fix this problem. When I complained to tech support they offerred to replace the phone. Since the problem was with factory installed software I did not see how this was a fix. Their software was functioning as malware and they could not fix it. I got no where. I am getting the same poorly operating phone as a replacement. Do not buy this phone. Unless you like spending hours on tech support and waiting a week for a replacement with the knowledge that you will soon be able to do it all again. I will never buy an HTC product again.

I don't know where to start ....,"This phone has been a major disappointment plain and simple. It's wifi is weak and does not have good range. It's reception is poor and drops calls constantly.

When it does lose reception, it takes a long time for it to find the signal again. Frustrating to say the leastThe battery life is the worst I've ever experienced. At around 7 pm each day, even on days that I don't use the phone that much, it tells me I need to recharge. And if you get the message you'd better do it because it will shut down quickly on your very next call.It is not user friendly and does not send or receive mms messages and even when the APN points are defined as per my cell phone carrier. I only sometimes receive MMS messages and I can NEVER send them.I rue spending the money on this phone. Besides the poor reception, the wifi, the mms features (essentially the basic that should work well on any phone), all the fancy android stuff works well. It has a nice camera, but don't use the video feature too long because it sucks the battery like there's not tomorrow.Don't waste your money on this pretty phone.",2011年11月19日 在美国审核

What are the Networks Supported?,"In the description it says:""This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Not all carrier features may be supported.Ultra-fast, 4G-enabled smartphone running Android 2.2 with 4.3-inch multi-touch Super LCD display.""Instead, why don't you include the useful information like the bands (frequencies) covered?That way people can tell if this phone will work on their network.Something like this would be great,Network:HSPA+ 850/1900 MHzGSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHzNow I pulled this from the HTC At&amp;t page, but that doesn't mean this is what this phone is.Please clarify for users in foreign countries where the carrier is less important than the bands covered.Cheers",2012年2月11日 在美国审核
"A little glitchy, but so durable","Yeah this phone has its flaws, like glitchy and somewhat unresponsive touch screen, its gotten some abuse the last year and a half I've had it. The durability of this phone is like no other. I've seen other people who have smartphones drop it once and its toast, especially iPhones. With the htc sensation I have, accidentally left it in pouring rain, dropped it out of cars countless times, dropped it on concrete from 4- 5 feet dozens of times, I've actually accidentally stepped on it one of those times on accident, my dog chewed on it at some point, all this, WITHOUT a case! It's not a Nokia, but its impressive for a smartphone. It does random restarts and the touch screen does its own thing sometimes, but to be the durability outweighs the annoying little negatives. 4 stars! Oh and one more thing, after a while if you are clumsy like me, the touch screen doesn't respond very well to large fingers, I have small fine fingers and I can use it with no problem. However my friends with larger fingers can never ever seem to get the phone to do what they want it to do.",2013年3月29日 在美国审核

Terribly Designed Device,"I've had this phone for about 5 months and sure it may work for the first 30 days, but afterwards it's not a reliable device.Firstly the phone has terrible battery life on a basic usage it only lasts about 5-6 hrs.Secondly, the phone gets no reception and as I browsed through various ATT forums on the issue apparently I'm not the only one having this trouble.My story is as follows: I live in Baltimore, MD and a few days ago my phone no longer functions as a phone. Its has become an over glorified iPod touch. Basically no matter how many bars show on the phone I get no calls, no texts, I can make no calls and no texts.And I've taken pretty good care of my phone. Dropped it once 3 months ago and nothing was wrong.I've lived here for the past 4 years and I've had ATT in this location and an iPhone before this device. Then I upgraded to this phone and few months later nothing. It's a dead phone useless and I'm stuck with a phone that cannot make calls or receive calls.And I've taken pretty good care of my phone.

This phone Rocks,"I always thought that iPhone is top of the game - I mean, Apple products usually are, right?Well, I was looking for a gift for my wife's birthday and I really didn't like price of unlocked iPhone. I'm not US citizen so I can't get it through contract, so my only option was to buy it for full price and lets be honest - it's greatly exaggerated. So, I opted to instead switch to Android phone. Woooooooooow! Hello thar! :)It took me awhile to choose which phone to buy and in the end, Inspire won with it's easily affordable price. Seriously, you can buy 2 of these for a price of 1 iPhone! And that is actually what I did - I bought one, used it for a week and went back to Amazon to order another one for my wife as the 1st one is staying with me.Lets be honest, though - phone is not perfect. Yeah, battery could be stronger (get yourself 1600 mAh or stronger one for roughly $10), software could be slightly more polished but in all honesty, this is a 5 star phone.PROs:* HUGE screen! And with high resolution, wow!* Easy to customize (software and hardware [i.e. stronger battery]). Take that, iPhone!* PRICE! Did I mention that you can buy 2 of these for the price of 1 iPhone? Seriously? Steve, you've been awesome guy, may you rest in peace, but your products have been greatly overpriced.* 8 MP camera! (not the best quality but surprisingly good)CONs:* Software could be slightly better. It does have some weird stuff going on, but nothing to tarnish this phone's great rep.* BIG! Seriously, forget about carrying it in your pocket. This is mini tablet, I kid you not. I still love it. :)For me, this is easy decision - this phone trumps anything else in the market when it comes to price/specs ratio. Yeah I know, everybody wants iPhone 4s, Samsung Galaxy S2 etc, but seriously, they can't really offer you much more considering huge price gap between them and this phone.I know I bought 2 for reason.

Great phone for a great price.,"Got this phone last week, as a power-user and avid Android fan, I immediately rooted it and installed a Gingerbread ROM. It helped the battery a ton, and made the phone a lot better.Pros - Nice display, great for watching video. Dual mics for noise cancelling in busy areas. A nice and bright flash that doesn't make photos too saturated. The speakers are great, I can play music, set it to really loud and hear it from the other side of my house. I wouldn't recommend it though, and would suggest a pair of headphones to go along with it.Cons - The battery life is nothin compared to other phones I have had. I get 24 hours out of it at the cost of 75% of the battery. (When in doubt, charge it!) The phone stock from AT&amp;T, still uses Froyo as its firmware, which is about a year old and unheard of for a phone like this that is above average, especially given the fact it is one of the nicest phones from AT&amp;T that runs Android.Protip, if you ever need to remove the battery, do it from behind the volume rocker.

The best phone I have ever owned,"This phone is simply amazing. I am an AT&amp;T customer and since this is the international version, you just need to take it for unlocking. Being the international version, you get the better processor and performance than the carrier branded version.The phone is blazingly fast and the multi-window feature is pretty nifty, although not very useful realistically, just in some rare occasions. The stylus is the most convenient feature ever in a smartphone since the color screen. It is super useful for note taking, screen captures and precise clicking on tricky pages. The other ""Samsung"" features (gesture support, air view, etc.) are all ok and useful. The screen is huge and colorful and a joy to use to watch movies and videos. Basically, this phone is a mini computer. Just to get this straight, this phone is so cool and multipurpose that I even considered buying a Bluetooth keyboard to replace my computer. No joke. You can even download torrents and use PDFs, Office files and scan and everything (with the proper apps, and I only download free apps).Structurally, the build quality looks pretty good but the phone is mostly plastic and very fragile. My HUGE critique of this phone is that without a cover, it is as slippery as a bar of soap. You HAVE to get a cover for this phone, to prevent slipperiness and to protect it from falls. I have a super cheap, brand-less, made-in-china $10 dollar plastic/rubber cover and it works like a charm. The trick is to find a cover that doesn't add to its overall thickness (I had an Otterbox for the phone and it turned it into a literal brick). The phone size without the cover is big (duh!) but it fits into jeans fine. I mostly store it in my back pocket and it only protrudes just a bit. You can also put it in front pocket and it will look and feel ok. If I am wearing thin dress pants or going out somewhere really fancy, I take the rubber cover off and take it naked (no cover) in a jacket pocket or a pants pocket and it feels fine.The only other problem I encountered was receiving text messages. The phone apparently stopped receiving text messages at least once a week (apparently a common issue for this unit), but it has not given me that problem in a quite a while (maybe an update fixed it?).Overall, this is the best phone I have ever owned.

SOOO glad I went with this phone!,"So I was really nervous about leaving Verizon (been with them nearly 12 years.I considered just getting the Verizon version but after weighing the pros and cons, I went with the unlocked option and got Straight Talk.So far so good (ok, so the data speed is definitely not as good, but it's not that bad either).As for the phone...PHABULOUS (sorry).Yes, it is fabulous.It was easy to set up and the screen is gorgeous.Even though my last Samsung also had a similar camera, photos just seem to look better here.I haven't begun to explore all the cool functions since I've had it less than 24 hours, but I am glad I didn't get a phone with all sorts of bloatware.I didn't get the flip case for the phone, but after playing around with it for a bit, I think that's what I'm ordering next to protect this beauty!Will update after a few weeks of use.UPDATE:So I've had this phone for three weeks and LOVE it.It still creeps me out that the phone's ""watching"" me to make sure not to dim the screen if I'm looking at it, but it's a cool feature.The camera/video quality is excellent...the pop up apps on the sidebar are amazing...and I'm slowing getting used to the spen.I also like that I can minimuze my video while I do other things (although I've used that feature just a few times).My fav feature is the ability to ""swipe"" (or continuous type as I think they put it) in multiple languages - not just English like my previous Android phones).As for leaving Verizon and going with StraightTalk, I'm perfectly happy with the service, reception, etc.Except for weaker reception than normal in my concrete building (reception was never that great), I barely notice the difference.The battery life is BEYOND amazing.My previous phone was a Samsung Charge and I used to be low or super low by 3pm.Now, I use the phone non-stop and still have 20-30% of battery life by 9:00 pm.Yes, it's big.Yes, it's a bit harder to do things one handed (especially since I'm terrified of dropping the phone - although I dropped it once onto a tile floor and everything was just fine).BUT...I'm glad I got this unlocked phone and I wish I could afford to get this as gifts for all my friends and family because it's a must have.",2012年11月30日 在美国审核
Smokes,"How fast is this phone? Ridiculously fast. How cool is this phone? Plus-ultra-chic. How good is the handwriting interface? Okay, it drops in a lot more capital letTers than iT should. But if you watch the options above the scratchpad you can fix flaws with a quick tap. And it is freaky fast reading my chicken scratches. Did I mention this phone is fast?Other folks can tell you about the specs for this phone and how it compares to that fruit company's phones and the other Androids. For me it is all about usability and this is the ultimate in my experience. There is a reason the fruit folks have sued Samsung - they cannot compete in quality/value. Between the Note and the S III, Oppa Samsung is kicking it Gangnam style. I should mention I have had a fruity phone - truly don't miss it. Best of all, no iTunes. Relief! Amazon MP3 and Kindle Apps are my new best friends.And if someone gives you guff about how big it is, fire up Netflix and show them about any movie. After they go quiet tell them ""Yeah, size matters.""I have no trouble remotely logging into a server and doing a few quick tasks. Remote mouse clicks are slick with the stylus. Reading a book is a pleasure. Short Emails are no trouble. Browsing the Web is very doable. I can turn my notebook off for days and not miss it.Works well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile worked well with me. I wandered into one of their stores, had a micro SIM card and a working phone in less than ten minutes. If you're already on Android then switching to a new Android phone is completely lacking in any pain whatsoever. If it does hurt then you're doing it wrong.Okay, this phone is not for everyone, but if you think you could use an Android on Steroids, don't hesitate.",2012年11月26日 在美国审核
Best Phone Ever!!!,"This phone is simply outstanding. I have owned and used many different phones over the years and I can honestly say this one beats them all. I'm a middle aged man with weakening eyes and less dexterity than I once had so my current phone (that was a good fit just two years ago) is just to small to for me to easily see the information being displayed. I guess you could say I grew out of it. LOLI looked at the iPhones and the Galaxy SIII but neither of those had the computing power as the Galaxy Note 2. The LARGE 5.5"" screen makes it very easy to see things at a glance. I find that I don't have to zoom in on websites as often as I use to because the S-pen allows me to click on the links and buttons easier.I know this phone's developers had the younger generation in mind when they were designing it but let me tell ya, it's a wonderful tool for us older farts too (Thanks Samsung).I find it difficult to choose which features I want to comment on because I like so many of them. All I can tell you is you wont be disappointed with this phone.There is one minor thing that is worth mentioning though. When I powered my phone on for the first time everything was in Japanese. This was a bit surprising to me because the GT N7100 was suppose to be for the North American market. Now, since I don't read Japanese and my unfamiliarity of the phone I couldn't navigate to the settings to change the language to English so I had to search online for an how how-to video showing me how to get to the settings to make the appropriate changes. It took a little time to find but I managed to get it all taken care of.As usual, Amazon shipped it ahead of schedule, it arrived in three days.",2013年2月17日 在美国审核
Phone is actually from U.K. and will not work after recent KitKat OS update!!!!!,"Do not buy this phone! What the seller isn't telling you is that the phone is actually from the United Kingdom (U.K.). I was unaware of that until the recent software update to the KitKat O/S caused it to stop working. It does not go past the introduction screen with the phone model and simply freezes.I attempted to fix it through a hard reset and through Samsung's Kies software (U.K. version compatible with the phone) with no success. It appears the phone's software is not compatible with this update in the U.S. Samsung in the U.S. refused to fix this software problem and advised me to contact Samsung in the U.K. I contacted Samsung in the U.K. and they advised me that they would fix it only if I had a U.K. address. Luckily I have family in the U.K. and was able to send the phone to them. It cost me over $100 to ship it to the U.K. after over $90 in customs charges.However, once Samunsung in the U.K. received the phone, they refused to fix it because the phone was used only used in the U.S. They did not tell me this over the phone beforehand after numerous phone inconvenient phone calls telling me they would fix it. (There is a 5 hour difference between the U.K. and the U.S.)I now have a approximately $700 phone that has stopped working in less than 2 years of use due to a simple software issue. No one will fix it because it is from the U.K. I hope the seller sees this review and will agree to fix it. If not, I will never buy another product from them. Also, Amazon must shoulder some responsibilty for this problem by allowing this seller to falsely advertise that the phone is compatible in the U.S. when it is not.Please help.",2014年12月9日 在美国审核
"Phablet, where have you been all my life!","This is the perfect size for me; the iPhone was too small and a Mini iPad was too big.So instead of having two devices, I use this one.I purchased a used (locked to Sprint) Note 2 on Amazon from a seller that got the phone from someone else.Unbeknownst to the seller, the old owner rooted the phone with Teamwin's recovery tool.I never rooted the iPhone (never saw the point in it), so I got a crash course in rooting.After causing issues with my accounts and preventing Samsung updates, I almost gave up on this phone.As a last ditch effort, I used the rooting to my advantage; I put on Cyanogenmod's 4.3 firmware!Unlike the iPhone, rooting is worth it on an Android.Android 4.3 is very nice and the phone works even better.My only complaint is that the S-note function is no longer as polished as Samsung had designed it, but using a handwriting app it meets my needs.I don't use cellular service on this, so I don't know how the reception is.Basically, I use wifi to make calls using Talkatone and Google Voice.Between work and home, I'm rarely without wifi so why pay $80-$120 for service?All my calls work as if I had a fully functioning cell phone.Using wifi, it does not matter what the phone carrier is set as; in fact I turn off the roaming.",2013年8月16日 在美国审核
worth the high price,"At first I was hesitant about spending so much money on a phone, but when you think about how much you are paying monthly for your data plan you might as well have a long lasting battery/huge screen/fast processor phone so you can make use good use of your data plan that you pay so much for each month.Also realize that you are spending 1 dollar a day for 2 years then the phone pays for itself.With those two ideas, it makes me love this phone.I personally paired this french version with the Straight Talk unlimited micro att sim.I was capped to very slow speeds (2G) for using 4 gigs of bandwidth in watching youtube one afternoon.It should reset to H+ speeds next month I have read.One weird thing about this model is that it comes with a wall wart that uses the european style prongs but the box also included an adapter for wall plugins that use the north american style plugs.Which kind of sucks because it protrudes from the wall pretty far and could be more compact for storage.Not a big deal because you can use any high powered usb plug from another tablet like device that uses micro usb.I've not had any hardware problems with mine in the 1 month I have had it.",2013年11月13日 在美国审核
Love this phone and tablet,"This Galaxy Note 2 replaces my old Galaxy 7.7 in phone/tablet (the international version p6800 has phone capabilities). The 7.7 was just too big! I love my Note 2 -- although I must say that I wish it was slightly larger, because I also use it as a tablet replacement, especially for reading using the Kindle app. I will not go into the technical specifications of this phone, as most professional reviewers cover those details in much more depth. Below are some of the highlights that I appreciate about this phone: clear and loud speakers, excellent speaker phone, beautiful large screen. I have found that the stylus is much more useful than I realized -- it really fulfills so many other functions, not just data entry.The phone uses a micro sim, so I had to have my standard size sim cut down to micro size. I like the standard micro usb charger and data port (thus no more proprietary Samsung cords). After months and months of research, I think that for the size of this phone, there is no real competition as yet.

AWESOME PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this phone a month ago and loved the screen size(even though my hands are tiny). The Super AMOLED HD screen brings the movies to life. Its like watching on those Jumbotrons in Times Square. More like a portable Jumbotron. The colors just instantly pop off the screen with some adjustments. Just turn the 'outdoor viewing' setting ON in the video settings and the colors get supersaturated. Also works with pictures. And battery life is outstanding, only problem is it puts a little weight on it(but all batteries do). The speaker is loud and vibrant which is awesome but its located at the bottom, which sounds a bit uneven when watching a movie. But overall this phone is a beast. I recommend watching a movie with lot of color like speed racer to test out the screen.A LMFAO music video will also help.

Great,"The best phone that I’ve ever had!!! It does all the things that I need and some more, only a couple of things on the downside one is that after being an Iphone user for many years it’s a bit hard to learn how this one works (mainly because it has so many options that the Iphone didn’t, which is great because let’s you personalize your phone and your experience with it to a level no Iphone could) the other thing, at least for me is the S pen it’s also a bit hard to understand how does it work and what you can or can’t do with it. Everything else is on the upside, the size of the screen, the ability to use it as a flash drive, download programs on the go and then when you get home you can install them in your computer, and many many other things I may be forgetting right now, but for me it was a great change from the too restrictive Iphone/Itunes nightmare to a more friendly Android.",2013年1月12日 在美国审核

**Still One of the Best**,"Keeping it short &amp; sweet, this phone is spectacular.I typically sidestep Samsung devices because of their less-than-stellar design and over-hyped features, but the Galaxy Note 2 is by far the best of the Samsung galaxy series. Why?Because its the only one that really aims to be different - despite having the similarly-redundant Plastic Samsung Design.Pros- S Pen:There's just nothing like it on a phone.Even if some people barely bother to use it, it is a very clever &amp; unique feature- Oddly enough, this phone works snappy with TouchWiz UI.I'm not a huge fan of the OS but it flows nicely on the Note.- 3100mAh Replaceable Battery(One of the best phones in terms of battery life - can last all day with heavy use)- HD SUPER AMOLED Screen -- Though the screen has a resolution of 720P,it is just as vibrant as any of the other high-end 1080P phones out there.I dare you to try it out.Samsung has really done a superb job of maximizing color clarity in this phone, despite its larger size.(The best way to recognize this for yourself is to test it out. The Sony Xperia Z series phones are 1080P and have Pixel Densities over 400, yet the display seems dull looking and colors are washed out.Don't let the specs fool you, try it out for yourself!)- The onscreen keyboard is amazing.No more accidentally double-tapping or nudging other keys.** The only substantial con for some people will be its size.However, the phone fits nicely in every single one of my pants.I have no issues at all with it. Obviously, if you like to wear super-tight skinny jeans, this phone WILL NOT be for you.But if you're like me and wear relaxed-fit clothing,you will have no issues tucking this bad boy away.I definitely recommend this phone.",2013年8月6日 在美国审核
AMAZING DEVICE,"I purchased two Note 2's and I must say it is the best and fastest smart phone (phablet) I have ever had the pleasure of using. People complain about the plastic body but I love it! Bought the titanium gray because the white doesn't look as premium. Phone is big but not too big as people claim but its a matter of personal opinion. My hand started to cramp up after using it for a while (lol) because..well they are small-average sized. I didn't think I would but I am liking the s-pen more and more and I am surprised to be using it at all. The screen is absolutely stunning. The screen size is just perfect at 5.5 inches. I Love the high contrast saturated colours especially when watching a full length film.Phone is very fast. Had several apps running in the background and didn't realize I left them open until i checked the task manager. Also, loving the motion gestures, yes they are gimmicks but they are very cool and most of them are useful. I could write an epistle about this phone but I won't. I DEFINITELY recommend this phone.

"Nice Phone - Until it randomly stops working, oh and BTW no US support","I've had the GT-N7100 (international version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 2) since the end of last November and for awhile I was really happy with it. Great screen, nice interaction, nice features, etc - until it just randomly stopped working one day. I was using it, then when I went to turn on the screen the next time, it just would not turn on and no sign of life except for a slowly flashing red LED. After doing some online search, I then discovered that this was apparently a common problem on the note 2 and, it would appear, also on the s3. I've NEVER had a phone (or any other electronic device, for that matter) die and not turn on again out of the blue, no warning or indication of problems whatsoever. I've tried all sorts of fixes suggested by different online forums, but no luck (I am an electrical engineer by training and know a few things about electronics... and no, I had not rooted the phone or done anything unusual to it.) Now I have a $600 brick!This, by itself, negates any positives of the phone. To top it off - Samsung does NOT service non-US versions of the phone in the US. I must contact a UK service support tech (on my own dime, and being 8 hours ahead of my time, does not give me a lot of call window) to see if they can do something with it. That pretty much means most of the unlocked Galaxy Note 2s you get in the US cannot be serviced in the US. Oh, and the 2 US service support techs I spoke with basically didn't care.This support policy by Samsung is pathetic and unacceptable, especially in view of how much they charge for these things!

Phablet! Best phone ever!,"First, let me say I was nervous purchasing a mobile phone online without the hand-holding that a brick and mortar store provides. However, I was so over the killer bills from my carrier every month, I was willing to buy unlocked and go to another carrier who would maximize my use and minimize my cost.In purchasing, I was pleased by Worldwide Distributors, which is backed by Amazon.I felt the risk was worth it. The phone arrived on time, in perfect condition, and was clearly new and unused. Relief! Now, to the product...I live in a family of iPhone users- I'm a Mac computer lover, but have veered off the Mac path for mobile phones. Have had several Blackberry's, a Droid Global 2, and most recently a BB 9930 which I loved for its keyboard, security and ease of use, but the screen is quite small.Enter Samsung Note 2, simply the best phone I've ever had. I was worried that I would struggle to learn it, as I'm no tech geek... but I was amazed at how simple it was to learn. (I was so worried, that I kept my other phone and number, figuring it would take a good month to get the hang of the Note 2.Because of the urgency of my being accessible by phone for emails and calls, I did not want to take any chances.) BUT- guess what? I ported my number over the.very.next.day- I had learned the phone in a few hours!Ease of use, A.Although it may seem large for some, it is truly a marriage of a phone and a tablet!I now can see traveling without my heavy Mac laptop- this puppy can do it all.With available keyboard and multifunction dock, this is truly a break-through device. I never listened to much music on my previous phones, or watched video- why bother?The screens on prior devices were teensy and the sound quality not-so-great.I am AMAZED at the sound quality of this phone, just from the stock headphones that come with it! The screen is a perfect size for viewing anything- no more having to zoom in. The ability to hand-write notes, cut and paste, draw, etc. is incredible.I have not gotten into all that the S pen can do, but there are so many possibilities...The quality of the screen is A+, very clear, and although someone had suggested in a review somewhere to use movie mode for good color saturation, I kept the standard mode.The screen is perfect for viewing TV and movies.It is absolutely (to me, anyway,) the best of all worlds. There are so many wonderful personal adjustments that can be made, it feels like a phone that is more EASILY customizable than any mobile I've owned.Have found no drawbacks yet- have only had it up and running for three days, so will be back should I have any problems with it.Honestly, I love this phone- and yes, I'd marry it!:)",2012年11月26日 在美国审核
Amazing Phablet!,"I've had this 'Phablet"" (phone and tablet) since around the middle of December and it has become indispensible!Aside from the usual: camera, video recorder, voice recorder, calendar (which I find so convenient I've stopped using my paper diary), calculator, movie player, music player (total entertainment system really), WiFi, Bluetooth, internet, email, etc.: with the built-in stylus and S-Note I am never without something to jot a quick note whilst I'm on a call, doodle, draw multi-coloured pictures with a variety of nib sizes, or hand write notes in class.I no longer have to carry a notebook to school, I have the notes for four subjects on my fabulous, phablet which I ALWAYS have with me. I can cut and paste from the screen and add it to an SMS or email message; or, whilst on a call, draw directions and send it to the person I'm speaking to with just a couple of clicks.I may sound gushy, but I love this phone!I really don't know what I did before I had it.Apps are unending: recipes, to-do-list, shopping lists, flashlight (using the camera flash), several versions of the Bible, an office app to do spreadsheets, word processing and even power-point, dictionaries, translator, currency converter, Kindle, Skype, you name it, it's on my phone.I bought a 64GB memory card at the same time and have loaded NCIS Series 8 (over 20 shows); Suits series 1 &amp; 2; loads of music and pictures, and around 10 full-length movies so I am never bored.I also bought a Zenus Color Point Wallet Case with it: so . . you guessed it, it's also my wallet, I no longer carry a seperate wallet, i have all my cards in it and a few dollars for cash purchases.I have even sold my iPad 2 as I found I wasn't using it anymore, I can do everything on the Note 2 (ok, the screen's amaller than the iPad, but I can still comfortably watch movies on it), AND without the case full of cards and money, it fits into my shirt pocket.My Note 2 has also replaced my internet service provider as my phone company has 4g, I just tether and use it as a hotspot with my laptop anywhere I go (I have an unlimited plan), and it's FAST, faster than my previous internet service.Did I tell you I LOVE this phablet?Oh yes, the phone works great too. :-)Clear as a bell, great reception, I've been using the headphones that came with it for calls as well as entertainment media as the phablet IS a little large to put to my ear.However, the microphone on them appears to be failing (they have lasted longer than any other headphones I've ever had, I'm pretty rough on them), lately people are saying I sound faint unless I hold the mike to my mouth.Battery life is awesome, especially with Power Saving on, I've gone 3 days without charging if I don't use it as a hotspot or watch a movie (hotspot drains it FAST, even with P.Saving enabled).After 3 months I am still finding new things it can do, or that I can do on it (there's an S-Voice controller, and gesture controls which I haven't got around to using yet).If you just want to make a call, this phone is not for you as the learning curve is kinda steep (I HATED it the first week I had it as I was replacing my BB Torch which had stopped working and it took me a while to fugure out how to use my new android), but if you don't mind a pretty steep learning curve, with total satisfaction at the end of it, this is the device for you.",2013年3月14日 在美国审核
Best smartphone ever!,"I won't go into all the features and details of this phone as you can obviously find that elsewhere and they are numerous.But after a week of owning the Note 2 the only complaint I have is no ""Mark All as Read"" option in the native email.I bought the Note 2 specifically for the S-Pen (*cough* Stylus), because I have large hands and most high-end smartphones have little tiny touchscreen keyboards. Not only is the screen incredibly responsive to the S-Pen, but it also does a great job converting the handwriting to text. Gone are the days of having to use special one-stroke characters to write like on older PDA's - just write something as you normally would in the text field, and use a quick right dash to space, quick left dash to backspace, a paragraph mark (like a J but starting at the top with a 90 degree angle) for a new paragraph and lots of available S-Pen gestures using the pen's button. When I do use my fingers on the keyboard, the large screen is much more accomodating for those with big hands.The reception is great especially for an Android smartphone, and everything runs fast and smooth on Android 4.1. If you want hype, go with an iPhone, but if you're looking for the best of the best in mobile devices, look no further. The hefty price tag may be daunting, but when you get your hands on it you'll be happy you made the right choice!(Entire review written on my Galaxy Note 2)",2012年11月1日 在美国审核
Fantastic phone,"This is an amazing phone. I have been using it for a couple years now and am really impressed. After daily use for 2 years it still has great battery life, and can complete any task I need it to. I am very impressed with this phone. I expected to need to replace it after 2 years or so, but I currently have no plans of doing so. Samsung has earned my trust in the mobile phone business.I highly recommend this phone, or a newer version if you feel the minor upgrades are worth it.The only criticism that comes to mind is the autocorrect feature that has actually gotten worse over time.",2015年3月29日 在美国审核
Good phone Bad charger,First I am a real customer not a salesman writing a 5 star review.Product arrived in good condition but the box was open (samsung factory seals broken).I assume this is because the seller had to unlock the phone before it was sent to me as they do not sell factory unlocked samsung devices.Phone condition was good no scratches it appeared to be new.The phone worked fine with my AT&amp;T sim card.3G speeds are not available only edge and H speeds.This is an international phone and that is not mentioned by the salesman.When I first turned on the phone it was in German.I also ordered the 64gb san disk card and so far no issues with that I put it in the phone and pow I had 59 gb available plus the 9 gb that is available on the phone when you recieve it (16gb but really only 9 gb due to OS).Fetures are awesome and the phone is great everything I expected.The back cover is difficult to take off and put back on and very cheaply made but I dont plan on pulling it off again.I got the Ionic case with it and it is an ok case.This would have been a 5 star review but the very cheap crappy samsung USB adaptor plug in (USB cable to a wall plug type adaptor) did not even last a day.For $700 bucks you would think samsung could supply you with a normal wall plug type charger not a crappy adaptor for a USB cable.Now I am having to charge my phone with the USB port on my note book and it takes forever due to the battery size in the phone.Also I am not sure what everyone is talking about as the battery fully charged only lasted a day with heavy usage.S Pen is really cool as well as voice command.This morning when the alarm went off to get up I just said stop and it turned off the alarm.My S Pen is a little sensitive but I am sure I will get used to it.Bottom line dont get hung out to dry if you order this phone go to best buy or whatever and buy a real wall charger for the phone.Update:I can't use the samsung app because the phone says it has a samsung app account in saudi arabia.Originally I thought the phone was from germany but now I understand because there is a direct flight from jeddah to frankfurt.The germans are buying these a cut rate prices from some foreign source in saudi arabia and then mark up and sell.Phone could be from a batch of defective phones.Corruption is so bad in saudi arabia who knows.As of right now only issue is the quick command stopped working for the s pen.,2013年1月15日 在美国审核
Love it!,"I've been stuck with a broken HTC for WAY too long and upgrading to something that can even handle a higher version of Android was a pleasure to move to!The battery life is good but I still carry an external 13,000mAh external charger battery pack.Speed, features, build quality, price, size...all great!Only thing is it's not a one handed phone and so you will be annoyed before getting used to it.Note, there is no 4G radio in this model, but it goes do HSPA+ which is just as fast and unlocked means I can go between AT&amp;T or Tmobile.",2013年8月9日 在美国审核
Absolutely Amazing!,"I don't want to talk too much about technical specification of the device. Instead, I would like to first mention about the seller. There are tons of comments on the product here but only a few talk about the seller. Before buying this phone my main concern was to prefer the right the seller (considering there are many strange and unreliable seller in the market).I bought this product from Ranascorp (fullfilment by Amazon). The phone was shipped immediately and delivered in two days. I don't know why but when I opened the package I saw that the box was open. However, everything other than the open box was OK. The phone was brand new with protector films in place.The accessories were brand new as well (though I bought a titanium gray phone the accessories are white). Ultimately, I'm very happy with my purchase.The phone is literally amazing. From the very first moment I have been dealing with the phone almost every minute. Most people think that it has a huge size but believe me when you see that giant screen you will fall in love with it (though I'm 6' 3"" I still had some concerns on the size). As soon as you start using the phone you immediately get rid of your concerns on the size.I'm pretty sure that most of you are reading every article about the phone and checking every website before buying it ( exactly like I did) and you have many concerns like resolution, color saturation, super amoled screen etc. Guys, let me tell you something: do not hesitate even a moment to buy this phone.Be sure that you will never feel regret or look back to your old or new Iphone or other types of phones.I bought an Iphone 5 to my wife 2 months ago and when she saw my Note II she suddenly she started to dislike her Iphone:) Now, she wants another Note II for herself:)Now, a few things for who already have the phone. If you didn't do it I recommend you to have a look at youtube and search for ""Coldfustion's Android 3D UI Tutorial [Galaxy Note 2] "". When you see the things you can change and the new look of your Note II I'm sure you will not believe it. Of course, everybody using an android phone might have the same look but it would not be the same as in your Note due to the screen difference. I applied many of the things Coldfustion described in that video. I further customized different things thanks to the inspiration by Coldfustion. It's up to your creativity.As a conclusion, I'm definitely very happy with my purchase. This is a great device. I was going to buy a tablet but I don't need one now.",2013年3月5日 在美国审核
A long story,"I had a long road with this phone. When I initially got it, I could not get it to connect to my network, went to T-mobile and they tried to get it to connect and failed as well. I spent some time trying to fix it but didn't get to it within the 30 day period until my previous phone was stolen at the gym. I had to get the phone working at this point. I went to a phone technician and he told me that the phone was stolen because the IMEI was blacklisted. I replied this was impossible since I bought it shrink wrapped through Amazon. I went to a 2nd &amp; 3rd phone technician who told me the same thing. At this point, I was livid and thought I had been scammed so I initiated a return request even though it was outside the 30 day window. Amazon and the seller immediately jumped on the issue.While the seller initially protested that it was impossible the phone was stolen, I was skeptical at this point. The seller was very attentive to my concerns. The 3rd technician got it all sorted out. While I don't know understand exactly what was wrong, I think that it may have just been that one in a million phone that had a problem with the IMEI or firmware. I told myself that I would never buy anything online again when I initially contacted Amazon but the way that Amazon and PVCS handled the issue secured my business if I do need to buy something online again. While I cannot give the transaction 5 stars because I had issues with it and had to spend an extra $120 to get it sorted on my own, I am content with the end result. Thank you to Amazon and PVCS.",2013年6月12日 在美国审核
Amazing Phone!!!!,If you looking at this your at least considering this phone. Do it!! This phone is amazing. The only concern I had at first was the size. After 15 minutes I was used to it. Now I feel that my iphone is tiny. My friends who have an iphone 5 when I pick it up I'm like where did you get this little tiny baby phone?? lolOverall great experience. I put the extra money into getting the factory unlocked and I don't regret it. Not only do you get the updates directly from Samsung you also have a carrier logo free phone.

Samsung Galaxy Note II,"Nice. One of the best smarthphones on the market.I dont think a person with small hands would enjoy this phone. I do think, for comfort, you usually end up using two hands to handle this phone. Very responsive, beautiful screen. With google play, the apps are endless. Plus, there are many third party apps, that I did not know about until I got this phone. Samsung, itself, has an app store.Surprisingly, the S pen has come in handy. I did not think I would be using it, yet I have found that it is useful and feels natural when you write.Speaker is loud.CPU is very powerful, I have played two youtube videos at the same time and they both played smoothly. How I did this? Well, with this phone, one can have two apps on the screen; split screen. So I opened up the youtube app, and through google chrome went to the youtube website; I had two different videos playing simultaneously. Kind of dumb, because they are both playing out of the same speaker, but still, this demonstrates just how powerful it is.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and can see that a lot of people will be jealous when I pull this beast out :)",2012年12月1日 在美国审核
"Beautiful phone with great call quality, however too much bloatware inlcuded by Samsung and warranty is not offered globally.","This is a great phone. Large screen, bright display and is very fast. Great call quality, especially the speaker phone. I cannot stop using this phone. Unfortunately, the phone only gets three stars to two reasons:1. Warranty and support is not available in North America where this phone is used. If Samsung is selling unlocked world phone, they should honour the warranty anywhere, as long as the customer can produce proof of purchase. And why is Samsung bowing to the Telcos and not releasing unlocked phones in North America? Hopefully, I will not have to deal with warranty issues, but I don't see this going well if I do.2. All the bloatware Samsung include with the phone. There are tons and tons of apps I will never use. Why not give customers the option to remove apps that is of no interest to them. These take up precious memory that you cannot reclaim. Painstakingly disable each app is not sufficient. There should be a uninstall option with no reinstall with future OS upgrades. The only plus is this unlocked phone has slightly less bloatware than a phone purchased from a Telco.Upon receiving the phone, I thought it would definitely be a five star product. After turning it on, I was immediately disappointed with all the crap on the screen and no option to remove them. Thankfully, the phone is still usable (after disabling most of the included apps) and the call quality is great.",2013年12月10日 在美国审核
Great product but read this BEFORE YOU BUY,"Great product...but the description doesn't tell the whole story.First off the description of the phone is accurate. Authentic Galaxy Note II, so I won't waste your time with a long description of what you already know. You really need to know something about the OS though.This phone will come with Jelly Bean 4.1.1 which is an outdated OS of Android, that being said if you are in the US using a GSM carrier that has an update for this phone, it shouldn't be a problem to receive an OTA update. THIS IS WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES IN... The phone I received COULD NOT receive an OTA, THE ONLY reason for that would be if the phone's programming had been modified and it has been.What that means is that the OS installed by SAMSUNG has been rooted and modified by someone (I don't know if its the seller, but surely they should be aware) therefore SAMSUNG will not honor any warrantee associated with this phone. Neither will you be able to upgrade the OS on the device through standard means.If you are not familiar with ROOTING devices and you will like to upgrade the phone's OS (operating system) then stay away from this one, but you can easily unroot the device back to the manufacturers specifications, thus reinstating the warrantee, and enabling you to upgrade your phone with an OTA (over the air) update from your carrier.Why would someone root the phone?There are a number of reasons: to gain master control over pre-installed apps and remove them, overclocking, installing a custom ROM, (it's really cool).But doing so almost surely will leave you on your own if something goes wrong with your phone, not Samsung, not your cell phone carrier, nobody will be able to help you if you do something crazy and totally brick your phone. (meaning your phone becomes a useless paper weight)**************************************************************************************************************************************************************You still want it?Okay...Well let me point you in the right direction to help you unroot this device. First you will need to download a rooting app from Google Play. Once you have it you need to gain control of your device by enabling ""survival OTA"" or ""temp unroot"", then you will need to reset your device. ( I have skipped a few steps in between and I would advise you to research how to unroot your N7100) on YOUTUBE or GOOGLE it. You don't need to go the ODIN route or even looking for an Official Stock ROM from Samsung.Once you have established the unroot, simply use SAMSUNG KIES to upgrade the firmware to Kit-Kat 4.4.1, there are substantial differences that are definitely worth the effort. Otherwise you can download your own custom ROM in which case you probably haven't even read this far in the review.*************************************************************************************************************************************************************The Device:Because it has been modified I cannot say the device is new, but the device I received looked pretty new to me. No visible scrapes, prints, dings or anything. You won't be disappointed in this regard.Speaker quality it decent for a flag ship device, the camera, processor speed are all very good.Service:Since I live in the US I can't speak for anywhere else. This phone does not receive 4G on any carrier, It does get HSDPA which is like 3G at its pinnacle so its like 3.5 which is still pretty fast. Call quality is excellent.***************************************************************************************************************************************************************I hope this review helps some of you who are considering buying this phone, Bottom line, it is an older model phone but the price is very reasonable for the specs. I will try to answer any questions you might have in a timely manner.Cheers!",2014年11月23日 在美国审核

Amazon partner merchant sent me a refurbished Note II instead of a new one,"Typical bait and switch. I paid for a new Samsung Galaxy Note II and I received a Refurbished one. Both ""DO NOT ACCEPT IF SEAL IS BROKEN "" labels are broken and the protective skin covering the screen has grit trapped under it. It definitely is not new, as labeled with a cheap looking bar code. I did not dare take it out of the package to inspect it further so as not to incur a damaged packaging charge, which they probably will try to charge me any way and I will have to challenge - Yada Yada Yada. It will take days to sort this out. I am very disappointed in Amazon for putting their logo on the products of such obviously dishonorable gutter merchants like TechGiant. Avoid them if you want to get the product you ordered and have to deal with days of hassle to get what you wanted.The phone looks good.I hope I get a new one next time.Update:Vendor responded quickly and politely apologizing for the ""mix-up"". I gave an extra star for that.I have no evidence this was not a mistake, but I have had similar ""mistakes"" with Amazon partners too often for them all to have been truly accidental.I have returned the phone as this is my only option.

Beware of seller!!!!!!,This seller (worldwide distributors) is selling phones that are (NOT) compatable to the USA...I have been having problems from day 1 and I thought I being a new user did not understand the phone and how to use it properly but as time has gone by it's gotten worse and when i contacted the seller to tell them the issues they said it was past the 30days and to contact the manufacturer because the phone is still under there warranty and they will fix it no problem. Well I did contact them and they had me read the phone's codes and they said the phone is hard wired to (Africa) so it's not hard wired to USA and that it's not under warranty because the phone is not compatable to the US and it's only gonna get worse as time goes on because the up dates will cause the phone to go out of sinc....So with neither the seller* (worldwide distributors) or (Amazon) not wanting to take responsibility and don't want to fix my phone or get me a new one that's USA made and compatable I'm warning you to stay away from this company and not do business because they will not make this right I spent $635.00 for a phone that is absolutely not very functionable or adiquite to work right.

Not compatible with Verizon Wireless or Sprint!,"First off, let me just say that this phone is incredible. The screen is huge and vibrant, the S-pen is amazingly functional, and it's the perfect size. Just small enough to fit in the pocket, and just big enough to provide the added benefit of a larger screen. There are other reviews describing how awesome this phone is, so I'll let them do most of the talking.I specifically wanted to write this review just to let everybody know that this phone is GSM-based, which means they use a SIM card and ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON OR SPRINT. Verizon and Sprint use CDMA-based phones, while AT&amp;T and T-Mobile use the older style of GSM. So if you're planning on buying this phone and connecting it to Verizon or Sprint, it will not work.

Luckily, Amazon customer service was superb as usual and I had no issues returning it and getting a refund.I hope this helps!",2013年4月17日 在美国审核
Samsung Galaxy Note II (Unlocked),"Before I bought this I was wondering whether to get a tablet and keep my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S II) with it. However, after reading several reviews and watching hours of reviews on you tube, I realized that this is the perfect device with capabilities of a phone with almost the size of a tablet. As a college student, I think this phone + tablet helps me to keep up with current news, my schedule, taking notes (thanks to the S-Pen), and really good multimedia features. I bought the device about 20 days ago and it arrived on time. Below I have listed some pros and cons of the device, according to my personal knowledge and experience.Pros:Call Quality is very good5.55"" Super Amoled ScreenS-PenQuad-core Processor with 2GB RamBattery lasts easily a day at leastLED Notification lightPhysical Home key buttonGood quality speakerRemovable batteryExpandable storage optionsCons:The screen quality could be a bit better because the screen is one of the main features (selling points) of this device.I realize Samsung makes most of their phones with plastic, as was the case with the SII, however, it might be time to change the material to something more appealing to the consumers.Software:The device comes out of the box with Android 4.1, and then I had an update to 4.1.1 which added the multitasking feature.Overall, the Android experience has become much smoother. (coming from the SII's Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich)Google Now is much better than S-Voice.Samsung has created one of the smoothest &amp; fastest phones on the market as of now by combining Android software with amazing hardware.Confusions regarding this device:LTE - The international version of this device does not have LTE capabilities. However, if you were to get it under contract from AT&amp;T, Verizon, or U.S Cellular, then you will get LTE capabilities.Home Button Lag - There seems to be a slight lag when you press the home button. This is because, by default, the phone is expecting the user to press it again to access the S-Voice feature. The S-Voice has come a long way, but personally, I prefer Google Now. So the way to fix this lag is by----Go to Apps---Select ""S-Voice""----Click menu button---Select Settings---then De-select ""Open via the Home key"" option. And the lag should be gone now.Capacitive button light duration - The phone by default has the capacitive light duration at either 1.5 seconds or 6 seconds. However, if you are having a hard time locating these buttons without the light, you can always change the setting under Settings---Display---""Touch key light duration""--then select the option you prefer.Updates - The updates are directly handled by Google and Samsung. So there is no carrier interference here. Since the Google updates their Nexus devices right away when there is an update available, I expect the unlocked version to be updated shortly after them. May be a month or two at the most. However, the carrier versions of this phone may take several months to an year or more to get updates. (Speaking from personal experience with AT&amp;T SII update from Gingerbread to ICS)Personal Experience:Personally, I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind the huge screen size, and the inability to do some one handed tasks. However, the pros for this device far outweigh the minor cons. Most importantly, the device makes really good quality calls and there is no issues with that (AT&amp;T service). One of the highlights of the phone is its battery. After I unplugged it at 7 am at 100%, then I used the phone for several calls, hundreds of texts, some you tube videos, about an hour of web browsing, played several games, Wi-Fi was on, and the screen brightness at medium, when I came back home at about 7pm, the phone still had about 70% charge remaining.",2012年11月20日 在美国审核

Awesome,"I have had this phone for a week now...and so far its got to be the best phone I have ever owned. Its big and beautiful..the brushed Titanium is just incredible looking..its very sexy..it is by far the quickest phone I have ever owned( last phones were iphone 4, htc evo the galaxy s) . Its very slim, fits into my pocket surprising well. If you are a girl wearing tight jeans this phone is not gonna fit u well. Though I don't know how much I will use the pen, it works surprising well. Jelly bean has some nice new additions that make moving around very easy. Battery life so far is off the charts good not only for a phone this size but any size phone. Today its 5pm, I have been using the phone pretty regularly all day and have 86% left!! My Galaxy would have been dead by now..only pitfall about getting a unlocked European Note II is that you will not be able to use the 4g lte network. Hspa+ is working very fast though..cant really tell a difference..one bonus of not having a ""AT&amp;T version"" is hotspots can be enabled without paying an extra fee..Also I understand software updates come immanently when they are available..Also there is not a ton of crap programs that come on it from the carrier to bog it down.",2012年10月19日 在美国审核

He loves it,The phone arrived. Relatively on time. The only reason this phone does not get a 5 star rating is because the the earplug port is somewhat faulty.The earphones that came with the phone are nicely styled. But only one bud wants to work properly. I ended up buying another set of earphones. Thinking this would help. It does to some extent but it turns out. We are having to put the plug at a certain spot at the port for both earplugs to work. This is not a total deal breaker for him. Everyday he says. I love it. I love it.

"Good device, the WORST manufacturers warranty","I found it is actually a good device but if the 1 year manufacturer warranty is important to you, then you may want to buy an iPhone.When warranty is the issue, seller won't help, Amazon won't help and Samsung won't help...whenever you ask for warranty (Samsung US, Samsung Latin America) they will say ""it is from Amazon...we don't support that"".These were the answers I received:- Amazon: They will tell you that it was bought in Amazon BUT through a 3rd party (which is difficult to tell by any customer because you will only see that in the check out screen), so they won't help. They may say they will, but in my case, 3 customer representatives said it but no follow up at all. This was actually very disappointing for me....but they won't forget to send you an e-mail asking if they were able to help to ""build Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company""...5 days and no reply.- Seller: They will complain about Samsung being the worst company for warranty, but they will keep selling their stuff.- Samsung: It doesn't matter if their name is in the phone, since it comes from an on-line shopping place, they will tell you ""we are Samsung US/LA and Amazon is in the web so is not US or LA"".So if you want to buy an expensive product as this one, my recommendation is to buy it in a physical store where you can actually find the same sales representative that sold you the item, or buy an apple product...if is their product, they will help you, no matter the country.",2013年5月11日 在美国审核
Incredible piece of hardware,"I just can't believe the change we saw on mobile phones in just less than 5 years.

It's so fast, so smooth, even sexy as it feels when I hold it. Can't say nothing else but ""GET ONE ASAP""...The only problem was (until a week ago) that I had to stick to the samsung stock rom for almost a month.

We have Verizon and I read the description up and down yet still never saw anything stating that it's not Verizon compatible!! Long story short, phone did come on time, didn't work at all for Verizon because Verizon specifically makes their phones a certain way so that international versions will not work, returned it, and the ""small fee"" they said was to be taken upon return was about $100!!?!?! Ridiculous!!!! Never again...",2013年6月6日 在美国审核
Not US version!,"This is the ""international version"". It came programmed in German, which wasn't too hard to change, but the plug does not work in US outlets.I'd rather pay the extra hundred bucks and get one from the store ready to go.Also, the one I received had been opened and the seller was very upset I gave it a negative review.They contacted me and tried to bully me into changing it.",2013年7月5日 在美国审核

Dont Buy the International Version,"I originally provided this 5-Star review: Exactly as advertised.I was able to purchase a tracfone micro-sim card and the phone works flawlessly.I also upgraded with a 64GB memory card and it works great.This was my original opinionHOWEVER...THEN The 3.5mm headphone jack quit working.The sound was very distorted.I looked on line on how I could fix it and was recommended to use an alcohol wipe with a straightened paperclip to clean the 3.5mm port.I did this an it worked...FOR A SHORT TIME.I thought I had somehow allowed dirt/grime/whatever to get into this jack.But the second time it quit working I was listening to it,Was working fine, then it just went out.Exact same distorted sound issue.I tried cleaning it, with no luck.I have found no way to fix this.Also, there is absolutely no support for an international Samsung phone.A phone without the ability to get sound out of a 3.5mm jack is ALMOST USELESS.Sure, I can use a blue tooth headset for calls and a blue tooth speaker for sound, but that isn't allowed on an airplane.All other functions work, just not the 3.5mm headphone jack.So I am downgrading my previous 5-star to a 2-Star with the warning: DO NOT BUY THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION OF THIS PHONE!",2016年3月18日 在美国审核

UK phone with no US warranty; Broken SIM Tray,"Dear Jupiter Sellers,I purchased this phone from you from US Amazon in April 2013. The Amazon description did not explain that it's an international phone with NO US WARRANTY that can only be serviced by a UK Samsung Center. This is deceptive; if you are going to sell phones to US customers, you should explain if they do not have a US warranty. The SIM tray just broke and the phone is not working. Samsung is requiring me to call their UK service center to arrange for service. However because I do not have a working phone, I cannot make an international call! They do not give an option to arrange for this service over email or calling a US affiliate.I would be grateful if you could please contact me to offer to call Samsung UK at 0121 643 7373 to book this purchase for repair, in which case I would delete this negative review.",2013年6月14日 在美国审核

I did not think it would be such an upgrade...,"My title comes from the fact that the phone I owned before this one is the Galaxy S III. I had the Galaxy Note 10.1 (the tablet) at the same time and I really liked the S Note app Samsung shipped it with, and the S Pen was a nice addition as well. I realized that the Note II had the same two things, plus it had a bigger screen so that's a plus as well.I don't have the time to leave a long interview, but I'll say this: I would use my S III for about 1 hour per day, maximum. I use my Note II at least 3 hours per day. This phone is absolutely fantastic. It's like Samsung took everything there was wrong with the S III (not that there were many things, the S III is also truly a fantastic device), fixed it, and named it Note II. The software that it comes with is astounding, the S Note application is absolutely amazing and powerful. The features that Sammy packed are just too many to count, really.Keep it short: no words can describe this device. If you're in dilemma and you're wondering if you should get it, get it. I had the same dilemma and I don't regret my decision for a split second.",2012年10月25日 在美国审核

"Good phone, but...","I previously owned the first Galaxy Note, which I loved. I was hesitating to upgrade, but at the end I just couldn't resist, so I ordered it. It's a fabulous phone and it's speed is just outstanding. But I am bit disappointed with the screen. The old model has resolution 1280x800, this one is only 1280x720, which I knew ahead of time, but I didn't really bother about the 80 pixels. Well, but I should have. Because of this reason, it doesn't support 5 icons in line anymore, neither 5 icons wide widgets, which is a shame. I had to install 3rd party launcher, so I can have it done. Why would you make a new flag ship phone, if you have to make compromises? The flag ship is suppose to be the best in every single way, just the perfect one, which this one isn't.One more thing which I don't like is the construction. I am not a iPhone fan, but the way they made the iPhone 5 is just outstanding. The body is very well made with strong construction, it feels expensive when you hold it. The Galaxy Note 2 feels very fragile, I can't even put on a table, because I am afraid I'll scratch the back. And my biggest fear is that I'll break the back in half when taking it of to change mu SIM card or memory card. I think Samsung made too many sacrifices to make the body slim and light, which is not acceptable for the flash ship phone.",2013年1月8日 在美国审核

"It does so much, I just want to keep playing on it!","I've had my galaxy note 2 for about a week now (sent from Blutekusa of Amazon). It was challenging at first because there was so much to learn and take in. But after going through all the settings and customizing everything to suit my needs, this phablet works beyond expectation. I'm loving it increasingly and it's well worth the money spent.The functionality of it is like no other. Installing and uninstalling apps is super fast and simple. I love that I can Google voice or S voice to call, text, look up stuff, schedule appts on my calendar, send myself memos and reminders, set alarms/timers, etc. without having to type anything down. I love that I can use 2 screens at once. The camera takes beautiful pictures, I was at the art museum a few days ago and the pictures turned out picture perfect. I can simply say 'cheese' or other words and it takes the picture, very awesome. Using the S note and S pen is also very fun and allows me to be creative. The possibilities are endless with this amazing device. I'm very content! I hope to have this for a very long time.The battery life is terrific! After using it a whole day, I'm at just the half way point when I put it on the charger.I only thing I'm disliking right now is that I can't download my picture text messages on Net10's AT&amp;T network.but that is a network issue, not a phone issue.",2013年6月19日 在美国审核

"Beware, they sell UK model, defective, no return","1. Purchasedmy Note II cellphone on Nov 19, 2012. Received it barely more than a month, it wouldn't detect the SIM card anymore, and sometimes shut down by itself. Of course there is no accident to the phone, and just normal use. My phone company replaced a SIM card, and it still wouldn't work.2. Contacted with the seller, SurgeTelecom through Amazon on Jan 13, 2013 and they wouldn't allow to return or replace it, since it is more than a month from shipping, though the Amazon holiday return ends on Jan 31, 2013.3. Called Samsung US support, they told me this is a UK model. Samsung US will not support the cellphone, and told me to ask Samsung UK for help. It is not easy to get help from UK, since I am in US.4. Issued a claim to Amazon for selling the UK model without noticing in the description on Jan 16, 2013. Asked to replace the cellphone with a US model or get full refund. 4 days passed, and no reply from Amazon yet.I will update the progress.5.

Phone froze after over the air update,"Avoid this product as well as FGS Trading (the Amazon seller that supplied my phone).The phone worked beautifully for 6 months.After an over the air update, the phone now freezes at the Samsung logo.I am told that this is the sudden death bug that affects the hardware on the Note 2 and some S3's.I have been trying to get the phone serviced for the last 3 weeks which should be trivial since it has a 24 month warranty. Guess again. FGS Trading says that after 60 days they will not support it.Samsung USA cannot service it since it is international. Samsung UK service center cannot accept a shipment from outside the UK.No one has a record of the IMEI number or the country of origin for this ""factory unlocked phone"". Still no headway with Amazon's A-Z guarantee. You have been warned.** UPDATE **It is now 7 weeks since my phone died after the over the air update. Amazon A-Z keeps denying my claim because they want letterhead saying the phone is under warranty. Samsung USA won't touch the device since it was manufactured in France. Found a Samsung help Center in UK and they verified the date of manufacturer indicating the phone is still eligible for 24 month warranty but that they cannot provided letterhead. Forwarded the email to Amazon A-Z service. They are still denying my claim on the basis that it is not on letterhead. Call in help desk at Amazon is polite and tries to be helpful. But there is no way to send emails, call or in anyway directly contact the Amazon A-Z claims people even to give them the information they request. The Amazon A-Z guarantee so far is headache, smoke and mirrors. Hopefully you will never have to depend on them especially to back a $700 defective product.",2013年4月24日 在美国审核

Thats allNow there can fit only 4 colums of icons side by side for example ( note 1 got 5 colums)Of course it heats a lot less and battery last about 50% moreBut that's the least you expect from a newer phoneIt also accepts 64 Gb cards. I did ity myself and workedOther issue: It uses a micro sim. So you will have to change your sim, or try to crop it with some knife (yes, the diference is only plastic arround the larger sim, so you can cut off)But it is anoying to doAt least the connector for charge and USB is teh sameBut since its, smaller, wont fit in your cradle chargerBattery is diferent too ( bigger)So if you have a note 1, keep it, dont trade for this one",2013年5月22日 在美国审核

"Wrong information and terrible service both times it was purchased... Great phone, TERRIBLE Service. DO NOT BUY From.....","First time around I bought this phone on random selection for the Seller. According to the title of this phone it's Factory Unlocked, it is not specified as an international model in the title or the description. Only way to know that it is international is by researching the model number or looking more closely at what each individual seller description is.The first phone I got was from FGS Trading, I didn't know it was international until after I received the phone and when it turned on, it was in Mandarin. I had to google and youtube a video in order to walk me through setting the phone into English, imagine the hassle. I contacted this Seller about the issue, also that the phone was not syncing with my computer because the ID Hardware was not identifiable. The Seller refused to take back the phone without charging me extra and finally after almost 2 months of debating the issue with the seller, through Amazon's A-to-Z Claim I ended up getting a full refund. Tom is the name of the customer service agent from FGS who I spoke to and demonstrated over the exchange of 30 + emails that he clearly is not fit for customer service. For him, his company is always right and I was the airhead who didn't do my research into this phone.THE SELLER does not follow their 100% money back guarantee unless they are forced to and their customer service is lacking, if they were competent it would not have taken nearly 2 months to resolve the issue. This seller also does not offer return labels for the assurance that an item can be shipped back to them, they only provide an address. You have to pay for your own shipping, insurance and signature on the package just to make sure the Seller gets back their phone. **Buyer beware, if you purchase an international model SAMSUNG USA will not cover this phone under their warranties. In order for me to get any service on this phone I would have had to send it all the way back to Hong Kong. The Seller does not provide you with this information. All they cared about and clearly demonstrated was that they got their money so they no longer need you or positive feedback. In one of the email exchanges from the Sellers' agent, he told me that MOST CONSUMERS KNOW this phone is international and that they are happy with the phone they received and since I am unhappy/unsatisfied/clueless its my own fault because I did not do my research. Does that mean that those who posted similar reviews are clueless as well??? :(Now here's the kicker, I re-purchased this phone because I have wanted it for a really long time, BUT since I did not want to run into the same problem, I did my purchase with Amazon customer service on the phone.Now, the Amazon agent was not aware that this phone was international either. World Wide Distribuitors did not have it labeled or specified as an international phone. I re-bought the phone only because it was assumed to be US Coded. The Amazon agent advised me that it was, otherwise the Seller must disclose that it is international.BOY!! were we wrong... I did not find out this phone was international until it was already in transit to me. The seller finally responded to my inquires 3 days after I made my purchase to inform me it was international. I immediately contacted the Seller by phone and the customer service person- Juan, who I spoke to was very nice. He told me to simply refuse the package. Aslong as the item remained unopened/unused and still in its original factory shipped form I would get a full refund.I followed his instructions and anticipated a full refund minus the shipping fee I paid. That did not happen. Upon my second phone contact with the seller, the first agent was not helpful, he informed me that I was subject to a restocking and a return shipping fee. At this point I requested to speak to a supervisor to justify why I was receiving two sets of information and how it was even LEGAL for the Seller to charge those fees.The supervisors name was Melissa, she was definatley NOT helpful. In fact, this person was unprofessional, rude and very condescending. Melissa informed me 1) my product was subject to a restocking fee and since the item was returned I would have to pay for that cost as well, 2) I could not contest it because it was a company policy clearly listed on Amazon's website and 3) Even if I filed an A-to-Z claim it would be denied immediately because the policies they have are all Amazon pre-approved. This person was snarky, rude and beyond tolerable. Melissa even refused to give me any company information in order to file a BBB claim. When I told them I would take the matter back to Amazon, she told me she would be happy to transfer me to Amazon customer service so that I can hear Amazon tell me that my refund request would be denied since I obviously needed to hear it from two sources.Two weeks have gone by since my purchase from World Wide and Amazon granted me a full refund since I refused this package. Amazon also gave me a promotional gift in the amount of the original shipping fee for the trouble I have encountered with the Seller. I have also submitted a BBB claim against this Seller and my complaint can be viewed publicly. So I suppose, in the end, Melissa, if you see this post, you were wrong.It's a shame really. I have wanted this phone for a long time and finally saved up enough to get it. Times are hard, cash is not expendable for most consumers and this purchase was a luxury item purchase for me. I never expected to get so much trouble. When I did have the phone, it was a wonderful experience since I had never had something before that could do so much. It played movies, music, took wonderful pictures, writing instead of using the qwerty board to text was awesome. I really love this phone but I will not sign a contract to have it :(.... Too bad that all the factory unlocked are international models.",2013年4月17日 在美国审核

Split screening apps and Youtube video ""overlay"" on your existing screen is great.UPDATE: PHONE CAME DEFECTIVE. As a mobile electronics tech for a repair dept specializing in Android-based devices, I diagnosed this device as a faulty ROM chip on the mainboard. I have spent the last MONTH trying to return this device to the seller and have since filed an A-Z claim through Amazon (they have been MOST helpful) and the seller has been EXTREMELY difficult to deal with. Within the first 2 days they told me to simply contact Samsung about my defective device. At first I just wanted to exchange it for the same item, now I just want to get as far away from WorldWide Distributors as financially possible. BUYER BEWARE !!! Great phone but buy from different seller in case you receive a lemon like I did.",2012年12月26日 在美国审核

False Advertisement of Product. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BUYER,"I ordered this phone. When I received it, I received that it was falsely advertised. It came in a sealed box and looked brand new, but when I checked the total memory on the phone it had 10GB is the total memory and 9.72GB was available for use because there were some preloaded apps that had use a small amount of memeory out of the 10GB. The sell ad said it had 16GB total. When I contacted the buyer, the tried to belittle my intelligence stating that they was 16GB on the phone, but the apps was taking up the 6GB of the 16GB making it 10GB left. First of all the know this difference between total GB on a cell phone and avaliable memory after some memory has been used by apps. I told them this. From the beginning, they gave me the run around for days before responding and then refused to give me a refund. Also there is something wrong with the backlight.

Best combination of power and portability in a smartphone,"First, a little backstory:As of two weeks ago, I didn't know I needed this phone...hadn't even considered it.I was reasonably happy with my GSM Galaxy Nexus.Sure, the screen on my GN had that grating pentile ""quality,"" but it ran stock Android with aplomb.Then, on a whim, I purchased the Nexus 7.I was quickly enamored with its screen - both the size and quality.Android really shines once it is freed from the sub-5 inch form factor of most phones. I started using my N7 for almost all my mobile device needs - content consumption/creation, email, SMS (look up Tablet Talk in the Play Store) - the only function it couldn't perform was calling.I joked to my friends that if the N7 were just a little smaller and I could insert a SIM, I'd use it as my primary mobile device.Each time I had to use my formerly beloved Galaxy Nexus, I was disappointed with the experience - the OS just felt constrained by the smaller form factor.So, after one week of being spoiled with the screen size of the Nexus 7, I knew I wanted a phone to match, hence my purchase of the Galaxy Note II.Now, on to the obligatory pros and cons:PROS- Screen Size:If you read my intro, you'd hopefully understood the primary reason for my purchase of this phone.After experiencing Android on the larger screened N7, I couldn't take the constrained feeling of the OS on my Galaxy Nexus.The Note II solved that problem.The screen size is perfect - 5.5"" really is how a modern mobile, multi-tasking OS should be experienced.- Screen Quality:Long story short, it ain't pentile, which is a good thing.If you've researched, you'd know it has a slightly funky RGB set-up, but bottom line:I can't tell the set-up is any different than a standard RGB screen.You'll like it - no, you'll love it.Colors pop, and I cannot see pixels.It is clearly on par with the only screen that I could ever personally compare it to:the gold standard iPhone 4/4s.- Multi-Window Multi-Tasking:Awesome.Basically, Samsung allows you to split the Note II's screen into two windows, so you can have two applications running simultaneously on the screen.For example, you could have a window on top with YouTube open, with the one on the bottom for GMail.I've found over the past few days that my use case tends to be: top window, Chrome; bottom window, messaging.This allows me to browse the web while quickly responding to texts.Unfortunately, not all apps support multi-window functionality (I'd love to find an RSS reader that does, and Drive support would be awesome).Facebook and Twitter support multi-windows, as does the aforementioned Chrome and some other apps.As an aside, I was slightly disappointed when I initially received my Note II and discovered it was running older firmware that didn't support the multi-window functionality seen in videos.Two days later, though, I received an OTA update that enabled it.- Touchwiz:I was concerned when I ordered the Note II that I'd quickly tire of Touchwiz, Samsung's skinned version of Android, particularly after running stock Jelly Bean on both the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus.Surprisingly, I've found it actually enjoyable, with numerous tweaks that facilitate better device interaction.Smart Stay stands out - you can enable the device so that the screen stays on if it senses you looking at it (it utilizes the front-facing camera).Toggles in the notification bar are quite helpful - I can quickly turn on/off Bluetooth, Wifi, etc., from the notification shade.I''ve found I've started using Blocking Mode as well - by enabling this, I can shut off notifications at night, but allow a restricted group of contacts to override the block and still reach me.- Horsepower:The Note II *screams*.It handles multi-window mode like a champ, takes photos quickly, installs apps virtually instantaneously, cycles through homescreens like (Project) butter.- S-Pen:the Note II includes a stylus.While not even close to being the primary reason I purchased the device, I've found small uses for it.I downloaded Sketchbook Mobile to doodle (albeit poorly, but that's because of my horrid artistic skills, not because of the efficacy of the stylus), I've scribbled a few notes, etc.I've actually found it to be quite adept at handwriting entry (the Note II transcribes your handwriting into typewritten format).It's also incredibly quick to trace out letters on Samsung's included ""Swype""ish keyboard.- Battery Life:After reading early accounts of good battery life on some of the online reviews, I was cautiously optimistic that it would be the case with the device, particularly with the 3100 mAh battery.I can tell you it is; in fact, at times the battery life is stellar.I know some folks will give you anecdotal stories about how their phones last three days under medium use, but I have always believed that ""Screen On"" time is the best indicator of battery performance.Using that metric (which you can find in the settings menu), the Note II gives me anywhere between 7 and 10 hours of screen time.That is absolutely fantastic for any size smartphone, particularly one that's essentially a mini-tablet.- Battery Charging:Samsung's smartphones (at least the ones I've owned) have notoriously charged very slowly.The Note II is, thankfully, not cursed with this. As I write this review, it's been on the charger for a little less than one hour.It's charged 40% in that time.My Galaxy Nexus charged at a rate of about 25-30% an hour, which is woeful.The Note II has a significantly larger battery than the GN, so it's charging performance is surprisingly good.- Physical Home Button:I like having a physical home key to wake the device.I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, but it's much easier to locate the home button on the face of the device than it is to find the small power key on the side.*Pro-tip*:Uncheck ""Open via the home key"" in S Voice settings.This will eliminate the lag between pressing the home button and the corresponding navigation action back to the homescreen.If it remains checked, there will be a slight delay between pressing the home button and returning to the homescreen (the OS is waiting for a second press of the home button to activate S Voice).Of course, if you like S Voice (I personally don't), you may want to leave this enabled.- Pocketability:It fits in my pocket with no issues, but this is coming from a guy who can fit the Nexus 7 into his dress khakis and cargo shorts.I'm a little on the tall side (6' 2""), so I'm sure that helps.- Camera:Tons of tweaks with the onboard camera software.Takes great pictures.I'm no professional photographer, but it's clearly iPhone 4S+ quality and SIGNIFICANTLY better than the shooter on the Galaxy Nexus.- Speaker:MUCH louder than the Galaxy Nexus.I can actually hear my phone when it rings - hurray!- Notification LED:Once you have a phone with this, you can't live without it.(update 10/9/12) - Stock Samsung Keyboard:It's quite good, and I'm currently using it as my default input method. I prefer it's dedicated number row above the alphabetical keys.Also, it has ""Swype""-like functionality. I don't know if Samsung white labeled Swype's keyboard or simply built their own, but it is accurate.(update 10/17/12) - Lack of Carrier Control:I overlooked this in my original review, but I think it's important to note that the international Note II's updates are directly controlled by Samsung.There is no carrier interference in the software update process.I was reminded of this today when I read that international Galaxy S3 devices are now being updated to Jelly Bean, while carrier-branded U.S. versions won't see it for months.*********CONS (this will be short)- Size for One-Handed Operation:At times, you'll have to use two hands to use it, much more so than you would for any other phone on the market today.My hands are larger than average, and I still have to use two hands periodically.If two-handed operation bothers you quite a bit, don't purchase it.- Additional Multi-Window App Support (see under PROS):It would be great if ALL apps could run under multi-windows mode - it is that useful.- Small Inconsistencies with Touchwiz:Nothing big, just little issues here and there.For example, you can create notes (essentially, draw) on the monthly calendar with the S-Pen (great for visually calling out an important meeting), but if you add the calendar widget to the homescreen, your drawn notes won't show on the widget.- Lack of Dedicated Multi-tasking Button:My Galaxy Nexus has a dedicated softkey for the task switcher.For the Note II, you have to long press the home button to bring up the task switcher.(update 10/9/12) - Capacitive Navigation Buttons Do Not Remain Backlit:The two capacitive buttons (Menu and Back) do not remain backlit when using the device, and once they're off, they cannot be viewed (there is no visible etching). This adds an unnecessary learning curve as your muscle memory adjusts to where each key is. Also, I prefer the Back button on the left of the device's face (it is located on the right) - it would be more intuitive/logical to position it to the left of the Home key.(update 11/19/12) You CAN enable the navigation buttons to remain backlit.As J.A. Smithers pointed out in the comments on 11/19/12, go toSettings --&gt; Display --&gt;Touch key light duration --&gt; (choose ""Always on"" and they will only go off when you turn the whole screen off, i.e. in standby mode).*********TL; DR:It's an awesome phone - if you like Android, it's likely the best phone available now.As long as having to use two hands sometimes doesn't bother you, get it.*********As an fyi, I'm running this phone on Straight Talk and consistently get download speeds in the 7mb/sec range.I'll try to update as I continue getting settled into the phone.Feel free to ask questions.",2012年10月7日 在美国审核
A Great Phone with Inherent Flaws,"Let's get to the nitty gritty:Pros:1- It's BIG. Big for gaming, big for videos, big for web browsing. Simply put, if you want a phone with the most real estate on the screen size, then there is no alternative. Don't be so mesmerized on the 1080p screens that will come out soon. Unless you want to destroy your eyes and use the phone from an inch away, you will not notice the difference in everyday use.2- It's fast. Yes, the Qualcomm S4 Pro quad-core beats this Tegra 3/Exynos 4 CPU in most benchmarks, but again, unless you are a hard-core geek that is OCD on numbers, you will not notice any difference in everyday use. There is no discernible lag anywhere (it's probably just your slow Internet connection).3- It's beautiful. Not HTC or Sony beautiful, but this is one sleek and stylish phone. The white is classic, but this Titanium Gray is awesome. Just check out the back cover and you will see what I mean (yes, even with that cheap-feeling plastic material).4- Did I mention the screen? It's BIG, it's bright, and it's beee-ay-eeww-ti-ful! AMOLED screens have awesome color saturation and contrast (most times even overkill, actually). Some people say it's not good in daylight. Um, have you tried cranking up the brightness??5- The Samsung/Android touch. Not everyone may like Samsung's Touchwiz user interface compiled onto Android, but I dare you to find a phone with more features than this one (and similarly the Galaxy S3). Here are the main highlights:a. Samsung utilizes the front facing camera almost to perfection. You can use it to control your music player; it has facial recognition to sense you are directly in front of the screen so it won't dim and turn off the screen (for reading, web browing, video playback, etc.); it recognizes your facial orientation so that when you are lying down sideways looking at the screen, the accelerometer will not kick in to auto-rotate the screen in the wrong orientation. That is something that has always bothered me with other phones and FINALLY someone has added that feature! Granted, not all these features work flawlessly, but it's a great start.b. Integration with Google is finally starting to show off in good ways. It was always once that Apple had the superior ecosystem. But now we see the future is bright indeed. Not just evolution, but finally innovation!c. The S Pen and all the neat things you can do with it. Preview a point in the movie before skipping to that point, and other things like going old-school back to the PDA days!6- It accepts up to a 64GB microSD card. That turned out to be the dealbreaker for me. Explanation in ""cons"" section below.Cons:1- It's BIG. With my tiny hands(hey hey), I can hardly do anything one-handed with this phone. Pocketability rating: -2. Putting it up on your face to make a phone call is also a big fail if you're sensitive to public ridicule like me. Have your Bluetooth earpiece ready.2- It's quite heavy. I really wanted to switch to the Verizon Droid DNA - for a 5-inch screen, it was remarkably svelte and light. And if it wasn't for the fact of pi$$-poor Verizon customer service at their call centers, and that it only had 16GB of memory with no microSD card option, I would have made the switch. The Droid DNA is superior in every way except those things mentioned. I have absolutely no doubt that the Samsung Note 3 (and maybe even the Galaxy S4) will be a 1080p screen with the Exynos 5 quadcore - can't wait!3- The screen may be bright and colorful, but it's way over-saturated and unnatural. Fortunately, you can go to the screen options and set it to ""Natural."" ""Dynamic"" is overkill, and even so is ""Standard.""Conclusion:Even with its inherent flaws, I can't help but love it. It's not even a phone, it's a cellular tablet(cablet, anyone??). I'm going to keep it. Until the next big thing is already here....",2012年11月29日 在美国审核
AT&amp;T Version REVIEW - BEST PHONE I HAVE USED YET!,"I have had a few iphones (3GS, 4, 4s) and then made the jump to Android to a HTC Inspire 4G, I wasn't blown away with the HTC phone as I bought it end of cycle on it's life then just recently had a forced AT&amp;T update and the 600MB of RAM just wasn't cutting anymore. I looked at the iphone 5 my friends have them and wondered how and why Apple is not keeping up with other device manufacturers?? There was no way I was going back to a smaller screen. I looked at the Galaxy S3 and wondered why people are buying this phone with the STRONG Blue/Green HUE (the whites aren't white) people I talk to didn't notice until I brought it up and compared to another brand phone. I looked at the Galaxy Note and thought WOW this is awesome but heard that the Note 2 was being launched soon and to wait...BEST ADVICE I had gotten - I am glad I waited!The Note 2 is FREAKING AWESOME. The screen is much brighter and whiter than the S3 without that strong blue/green hue cast to it. The phone is super responsive and Jelly Bean is just as good if not better than iOS 6 (IMHO) even my wife whom is a diehard iphone user was extremely impressed with the GN2. She thought it is too big for her use but said it was perfect for me. I am an older person 49 the smaller screens just don't cut it anymore -- I can actually read my emails WITHOUT my READING GLASSES. Everything is bigger on the display - though web browsing you see more on the screen but it's not actually larger.There are two complaints - #1. The AT&amp;T phone DOES NOT COME with HEADPHONES! For $299 this phone should come with headphones (not a deal breaker as I ordered them here on Amazon for $5.50 but I thought people should be aware! #2. As of this writing the phone does not have the split screen capabilities the international version has.If you are on the fence between this and the S3 the real difference for most is going to be the size of the device. I can easily fit the Note 2 in my jeans pocket with ease it doesn't stick out (your jeans may vary).",2012年11月7日 在美国审核
Goodbye Apple- Hello Samsung!,"Like many, I dumped my iPhone for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and never looked back.Others have written quite extensively about its many plus features, and I echo those sentiments.It does everything I ever imagined doing on a smartphone, and quite a lot more.Best of all, I am free of the dark side (Apple).I can now enjoy my choice of apps from a wide variety of sources, not just from the Play Store (the Android market) but virtually any other provider as well (requires a minor setting change on the setup screen).The huge screen makes viewing YouTube videos and Internet surfing comfortable and realistic.The tiny smartphones out there make using the web so painful many of us (myself included) never used that feature.This screen is amazing, and the videos look razor sharp.The benefit?You can live with this phone, and you need not drag your tablet or laptop with you to the coffee shop or restaurant.No- it's not enough if you are going to try to work on Excel spreadsheets- but for general web and email... it's great!Text messaging, your choice of type, swipe, or voice.And because it's Android Jelly Bean (now), you get all the joys of Google, including FREE Google Play to store all your (even iTunes) music up in the cloud on the Google servers.The BATTERY is replaceable on this phone (unlike Apple iPhone) and there is a micro SD-card slot inside the back case (i bought 64gb MicroSD card from Amazon for $50 and have 76MB of storage on this phone!).Since I use Google Play streaming all 7000 of my songs from the cloud, all that storage is available for applications, photos and 1080p VIDEOS.The 8 MegaPixel camera is more than fantastic, I never use my real camera OR Camcorder any more at all!Bought a nice UAG 'weaponized' case for this (also from Amazon), which doesn't add a lot of bulk (this phone is huge), but protects me from dropping it, and adds a bit of rubberized contact with my clothes- so it won't pop out of my pocket when I climb in and out of my car.Prior to getting the UAG case, the phone frequently jumped out by itself onto the car seat.Not good, and worse if it did so and landed on the street or a hard surfaced floor.Thus when I saw another person with the UAG case, I immediately jumped on Amazon and purchased it, though the clear-plastic screen ""protector"" was garbage - I didn't use it, nor was I impressed by the glossy color cardboard panels included with the UAG case- I think the Titanium finish on this phone blows the socks off any type of 'case decoration', possible exception being Game of Thrones Sigil-cases.One can never have too many talismans, and Winter is Coming!Nothing can be all things to all people, but this device is a solid win for Samsung- and a capable partner to their very popular tablet, the Note 10.1 (which I also own and very highly recommend).Much is made of the so-called Retina displays on Apple products, both the Samsung Note 10.1 Tablet and the Galaxy Note 2 Phone have great looking displays that are pleasing to look at with good color separation and nice blacks.The writing stylus I use extensively on the TABLET during flight simulation.I write down instructions from the realtime air traffic controller on the Note 10.1 (I could do this on this phone as well) during flight, so I don't have my flight deck littered with scratch paper.This phone is astounding, and great volume on the speakerphone.Music playback?Not a strength... I connect it to my car audio system (Bluetooth) or you can plug in a stereo earplug cord and plug it into your car audio input jack (as an alternative to Bluetooth).I don't think most people buy a phone for its music playback sound quality - the speakers don't produce enough bass to be practical, although the sound quality is acceptable, it's not as good as using your car stereo speakers!Overall- love it, and glad I left Apple.BTW, I got mine from AT&amp;T as an upgrade, with 2 year commitment, at a substantially lower price point.I was fortunate, having been an iPhone customer continuously for the past several years at AT&amp;T, I was able to continue with unlimited data.I do strongly suggest enabling Wi-Fi whenever and wherever possible, and pay attention to your settings if you are on a 'metered' data plan, else your phone may gobble your data time unbeknownst to you.I make sure to use Wi-Fi at home and at my office, Wi-Fi is always faster than 4G FYI.Battery life is excellent, though I make it a point to plug this in to A/C power in lieu of USB power when at home, because when plugged into the AC adapter, the unit recharges much faster than on USB.Great phone!",2013年6月11日 在美国审核
Good Phone - Some minor cons,I won't rehash everything everyone else said. This is a good phone. I am a big guy and have big hands. Fits in my pocket fine. No problems there. This phone saved me from having to get a tablet too. Why have both. Very easy for my small kids to use and keep them occupied.ProsSuper fast and responsiveBig clear screenCons - None of these are deal breaks. More tiny things that Samsung would be smart to fix.Phone back cover is slippery. I have had it slide of things to the floor and almost out of my hand multiple times.Wish camera lens was in the middle of the phone instead of at end. Close to edge. It is awkward to hold a phone taking pics without getting fingers in the way.The Samsung flip case is awkward when taking pics and video as it has to hang down instead of flipped in back (as it would cover the lens). It looks kind of dorky so I removed it.Maybe need to move the microphone. Sometimes people can't hear me on a call. The phone is so big my mouth is a long way from the bottom of the case where the microphone is.Seriously. Let us remove the shutter click and video start/stop noise. I know it is illegal to turn off in some countries. But in a quiet school auditorium taking pics of my kids the sound is SUPER loud and obnoxious to the people around me!Best Shot as a camera setting is not persistent. I have to select it every time. Annoying. As it leads into the next con.High resolution leads to a LOT of blurry video (on movement) and camera pics (have to keep it SUPER still)- Best Shot works the best. Usually one of them isn't blurry.A lot of App screen option are at the top. Like Delete in email. Goofy since your thumb is nearer the bottom. Almost forces you to use two hands. This should be adjustable to bottom if you want.I can't believe this next one was missed in every design QA session. Lay the phone flat on a tabletop. Push on the right hand side with your finger. The phone rocks! It doesn't lie flat. The phone is big so i often lay it down on my desk to work on it and it rocks every time I press on it near the right side with a finger or stylus. The reason you ask? Bottom left back is a hole for the phone speaker. The bar that covers the middle of the hole in the back cover is convex instead of flat. So the whole phone rocks on that point in the back. Weird miss...,2012年12月27日 在美国审核
One of the better phones I've owned,"What can I say, I think this is my favorite phone I've ever used. It's really surpassed my expectations. After a long battle with choosing what type of phone I wanted to utilize (I had the Droid Ultra, Droid Mini, and then went back to using my old iPhone 4S. I wasn't really thinking of changing to a new device but found one at a decent price (NOTE2) and decided to buy it.At first, the phone seemed humungus. Now whenever I use a phone such as an iPhone, they just seem small to me. The size doesn't matter a bit, it's a nice size for movies and games. The battery has proven to be the best of any phone I've ever owned (and there's been a lot of phones in my life, lol)Three annoyances, which I've been able to fix, are the S-widget bar on the left side of the screen. I figured out if you hold the back key in for 2 seconds the S-widget bar will disappear and not come back on unless the battery is removed or the back button is held another additional two seconds.The next con, is the water noises when the screen is touched. I figured out how to turn that off in the sound settings.The final gripe which annoyed the you know what outta me the first time I got this phone is the predictive text. It comes in handy for things such as Im translates to I'm, etc. But it doesn't understand what you wanna say, for example, if you say someones name the phone isn't farmiliar with in a text, the phone basically changes it to the word IT thinks you should make it to be. The way to fix this is to tap the word you want and then click out of that word, and press the space bar and continue on with your text message or email. I wish there would be a way to just shut that part off and leave the corrections on abbreviations on.Most of these things I'm sure are fixed by upcoming software updates, or new models,but I've made due with what i have, and what I have is an excellent phone.The best case you can get is a Platinum Case from Best Buy. I got mine on clearance as they were discontinuing this phone (a little bummed that I won't be under the XLTE requirements) but the case only cost me 5$.I keep the S-pen in the hole on the bottom of the phone because who wants a hole on the bottom of their phone?, But I've used it one time, but I just feel that you can do most of the work by just the touchscreen, I think that Samsung could have worked better in the finish department, my bezel is worn and the S-PEN ""upholstery"" was completely gone within a week or two, no joke.The phone is a tough (did get this moist once) good choice for you. And the screen never disappoints. I'm one of those people that constantly changes their phones because of new phones coming out, or reasons of stuff wrong with their old/current phone, but I really can't find a reason to switch with this one. I'll probably purchase the note4 when it comes out. The two things I've found wrong with it so far, are that it runs hot, like excruciatingly hot after a couple hours of gaming (I travel by train a lot for work) and that the S-pen chips away. The battery holds great, I am a ""power'user"" and I get mostly 3-4 days in heavy use. Work has said that they will switch to iPhones sometime soon and I've yet to see if that's something I actually want to do, because this thing is so perfect it's hard to believe.",2014年7月6日 在美国审核
"Its like an S3, on crack! [Note 2 &gt; (S3 + iPhone 5)]","The Samsung Note 2 does everything better than the S3 and has additional tablet like features. We all know that the build quality is great and that it has impressive technical specs. The phone is basically a quad core 1.6ghz mini computer that is like a node for my brain. This thing makes me feel like a cyborg, because I depend on it a lot due to its' high productivity and instant network connectivity. It basically makes life a whole lot easier. I love 4G LTE, and I vouch for GSM. I can swap devices or put in prepaid simcards internationally if I wanted to.There is also something more inspiring about the Note 2 than the S3 and iPhone 5. That is because of its very accurate S-pen stylus. Evernote + Microsoft OneNote make this phone an excellent device for school. I can hand write my notes using the S-pen's handwriting software and upload my digital notebooks onto the web. The S-pen has also enabled me to continue drawing and practice design w/ Autodesk's Sketchbook pro. Before being an architectural draftsman, I was a Fine-Arts major and this phone has helped me to continue working on my sketching skills. I prefer drawing on this phone than using my Wacom intuos 4 tablet. Its a very efficient and convenient phone for academic and artistic purposes.Negative speculations:There are some negative things about owning an Android phone. One of the reasons that this phone suffers is because of the sub standards android + Samsung maintains. Samsung manufactures cheaper phones and Android has to work w/ other cheap-ass devices as well, so the reliability and app market suffers. Apple is able to have the best app developers favor their devices because they have only one phone model's specs to program. This continues to make apple phones the best for apps and peripheral devices. I think that won't be an issue some time in the future, however. Also the music player on this phone sucks. It came w/ about 4 or 5 media players and I don't know which one is the default one. Almost all of those media players require a monthly payment. To me the best user friendly phone media player would be Windows phone 7's Zune player. It can easily play and search music + podcasts even while driving. Try changing a song on Android, and you could crash.Positives:The positive thing about using this phone, is that its an instant HDD every time its connected to a PC via usb/blue tooth. Dragging files to and from the phone is easy unlike the hyper intrusive Zune and iTunes programs. There is no converting audio files or transferring seed folders to proprietary software.WP7 users know how inconvenient it is to add Zune + Xbox live accounts just to add some music and play mini games on their phones. Itunes is just as bad, there is none of that intrusive crap w/ the Note 2. I mentioned that the Media player was crappy, but it is able to play uncompressed .Flac, .aiff, and .wav files. The Note 2 is a high quality music player, it just needs a nicer looking music player interface.I've tried the same apps on other android devices, but on the Note 2 they run better and faster.Like I said, this phone is a better version of the SIII in everyway. It has a faster processor, better battery life, larger screen, and large storage potential. Plus its has the S pen which is more than a gimmick.",2013年1月17日 在美国审核
"Innovative, super-cool","The Galaxy Note II is nothing like the competition. There is a lot of innovation or plain improvement in this phone, from the super-elegant design to the blazing-fast 1.6GHz quad-core processor, large screen, up to 64GB of storage that can be expanded to 128GB, to the innovative (and optional) and super-precise stylus-based input.And, yes, it is an Android phone, comes with Android 4.1 installed and everything that Android has to offer from Google Play and Google Now and, of course, the innovative S Pen extensions.We decided to go with this Note II for one of our family members who happens to be a growing artist. She draws, paints, makes 'things' every time she has the opportunity and the S Pen stylus and the software that supports it plus the ability to access media and play it on the Note's large screen are exactly what she dreamed for 'on the road' creativity support.The Note II may not be for everyone but for anyone who doesn't mind a 'giant' phone (or you can view it as a small tablet that makes phone calls) I can't think of anything better today. Of course, innovation never stops so I'm sure there will be better alternatives in a few months or in a year, or two.",2012年11月26日 在美国审核
"The first ""must-have"" smartphone... ever.","First of all, the Galaxy Note II is more than just another smartphone.It is a ""must-have workhorse"" that is the first and only smartphone to deserve this title.Comparing other smartphones to the Note II is ridiculous... they don't compare!The Note II is not a phone and it's not a tablet.The Note II is a sleek and solid powerhouse that does the work of a desktop, tablet and cell phone, all in one pocket-size device.How do you compare an iphone to that?You don't!Size:When I brought my Note II home and showed it to my teenage kids, no kidding, they thought I was BS-ing them that this was my new phone.It is big -- but not too big.Trust me on this.It still fits in pockets, pants, shirts or otherwise.Once I used it as my daily driver for a week I went back to my Galaxy S II and that once-great phone seemed like a toy.This phone hits the sweet-spot first and most importantly for get-work-done screen real estate.The less scrolling, the bigger the text, the more you see, the faster you get things done.THIS IS HUGE! Less important but great as well is the entertainment aspect of the Note II in video viewing, internet browsing and gaming.Again, trust me on this.Use the Note II for a week and worries of an iPad to your ear as a phone quickly fade.All other phones will look tiny and toy-like by comparison.Speed:I am a power user.There isn't a phone currently that can hold a candle to the power user experience on a Note II.The 1.6ghz quad-core processor and 2gb ram is the first smartphone I've used (previous best was a dual-core 1.5ghz, 1gb ram) that NEVER, EVER stutters, hangs, or goes into sleep mode when you ask it to do several processor-intensive tasks simultaneously.Stream audio, shoot photos or video, run your navigation, use your internet browser and then open a Word document all at once on any other phone and see what happens -- deep sleep, sudden reboot, freezing and so on.NOT SO WITH THE NOTE II!I have yet to run into an application/processor use scenario that even so much as slows down the Note II.Amazing!Magic:Okay, the Note II isn't magic, but it does a few things no other smartphone I've used or even know if is capable of.First, I use internet based applications for work in my real estate business.The Note II is the first and only phone I know of that runs EVERY web-based program I use as if I was on my laptop.It is the first smartphone that runs large web-based programs like my Multiple Listing program, or bank REO programs in a manner that is identical to my Sony VAIO laptop.Again, THIS IS A BIG DEAL!There have now been a number of times I have left my laptop in my office, my Nexus 7 tablet at home, and used only my Note II for everything at work -- email, word processing, photo editing, web-based computing.Impossible with an iPhone.Magic II:The S-Pen seems gimmicky at first, and let's face it, Steve Jobs calling your finger the best stylus ever, was right.But the more you use the included S-Pen and the apps that interact with it the more you realize how awesome the stylus is.Note taking in the S-Note app is easy and simple if you want simple.But, if you're like me and you want to max-out what a device will do, the S-Note/S-Pen learning curve is a little steep but well worth the time.Note taking with the S-Pen/S-Note combination is like pen and paper, Photoshop, digital camera, chalkboard with eraser, and MS Word all wrapped into one steroid-charged smartphone app.It is amazing.S-Note alone with all of its features has replaced 10-15 of my previously most used apps.It's Evernote, Freenote, Tasker, aCalendar+ and more, all in one.I've honestly never been so organized thanks to Samsung's S-Note/S-Pen combination and the S-Pen interactive apps.Magic III:(Sorry -- I'm running out of ways to explain how great and unique the Note II is.)The S-Pen, besides how fantastic it is using the S-Note app, allows you to annotate almost everything on your smartphone.It can take notes on your built-in calendar app, just like you do on your refrigerator calendar!Anything you see on your screen, from a webpage, pdf file, email, photo, etc., can easily be screen-captured and then written on with the virtual pen and saved.I can't say enough about how functional and downright awesome the S-Pen stylus is.Everything else:The CAMERA is excellent.HD video, built-in burst mode, HDR settings and more make the Note II camera the best smartphone camera I've ever used.The built-in Samsung VIRTUAL KEYBOARD is excellent.It has a swype mode.If you've used swype you know how great it is.The keyboard is integrated with the S-Pen allowing you to literally scribble text as it transcribes your handwriting into text, instead of using the virtual keyboard.Again, it is awesome.(It is the first virtual keyboard capable of replacing my once-favorite FlexT9/Dragon dictation keyboard.) The SCREEN QUALITY is great both indoors and outdoors.It is the first smartphone you may actually want to watch Netflix and Hulu Plus content on.The WEB BROWSER is the closest thing in a truly mobile device (try putting an iPad or Galaxy Tab 10 in you pocket) that runs the internet like my Sony laptop.The EXTERNAL SPEAKER matches or beats many of the aftermarket mini-box speakers out there.The audio from music and video is loud, crisp and clear on the built-in external speaker.More: I could go on with video chat, voice recorder, Samsung photo editor, frame rates and more, but it's just more of the same awesome.Negative:The ONLY negatives for me with the Note II are... the battery, limitations of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and the 16gb internal memory on U.S. carrier versions of the Note II.Others have talked up the great battery life of the Note II, but probably more than anything else spec-wise, ""great"" is a relative term.Yes, using the Note II like a normal smartphone/iPhone/Android phone you can get more than a day's use out of the battery.In my use-everything-all-the-time user experience I get 5-7 hours of battery on a bad day, and 10-12 hours of battery on a good day.5-7 hrs if you're streaming video, using the camera or watching continuous video is nothing to scoff at.It's pretty darn good.Since I use my phone heavily all day, every day, while by no means a deal breaker, it's the most notable albeit minor negative.There are aftermarket battery/back cover solutions that will turn the 3100mah stock battery into a 6200+mah battery.That might work for some, but I also love how relatively light and thin the Note II is, so I carry around another fully charged spare battery in my pocket at all times.Then there's the minor issue of Android 4.1 not allowing for app-to-sd transfer of applications -- making the 16gb version of the Note II a little sparse in terms of on-board memory.Yes, you can use a 64gb sd card, but honestly, limiting applications to the phone's built-in memory, if you play any of the memory-intensive games (Need for Speed, Broken Sword, Modern Combat, and countless others), really is barely enough on-board memory.Again, both memory and the ability to move large applications to the sd card are relative to the user and may not be a negative for many users.If Samsung and Google update the Android 4.1 OS making app-to-sd transfers possible, then the 16gb version would be just fine.Let's hope that Android update is in the works! The good news is that the Note II, as a flagship device, is certain to get updates to the OS for maybe as long as two years or so.Conclusion:If you're thinking about getting the Galaxy Note II, but think it's too big, STOP THINKING!GET IT!Odds are you will never go back to your 3.5"", 4"" or 4.5"" screen smartphone again.",2012年12月13日 在美国审核
"Wonderfully large, vivid screen.  Only one complaint.","The first time I saw this phone, in a Radio Shack, my mouth fell open.Oh, to have a phone with that large a screen seemed a dream come true (and to think Samsung is now coming out with an even larger one!). When my contract with Verizon came up for renewal I jumped on this thing the first day I could, and I've never regretted it.The screen is gorgeous, the phone is fast, and my friends say even on speaker phone my voice is clear with no interference. When I read Kindle books on it it's a bit cramped, but certainly not as much as smaller phones.I set the display to white text on a black background and it's easy to read in almost any light.I do have one complaint, which seems a major design issue I hope is fixed in future products.The volume button is directly across the phone from the button turning the screen on and off, and many times I have turned the sound low or off by accident and missed calls.It's also easy to change the volume just by handling the phone.So that's a drawback, but otherwise I simply love this.I also bought the Samsung flip cover, which replaces the back of the phone and adds a very thin cover over the screen.Love it.",2013年10月9日 在美国审核
DOES NOT WORK ON T-MOBILE PHOENIX (Roaming / 2G Edge Only),"The phone is awesome. But beware:The phone does NOT have access to 4g or even 3g networks virtually anywhere in the Phoenix Metro area. I was constantly on Roaming which means NO DATA. If I was lucky, I would get 2g and get slow data... but 99% of the time I was roaming and simply could not get data without paying $5/mb or something crazy.It is too premature to get this for Tmobile in Phoenix. They do not have a full rollout of their 1900mhz band towers active yet. The only place I had 4g/hspa+ was inside the Tmobile store, that's IT.I recommend not buying this if you're on Tmobile until late 2013 when all towers are fully installed and activated (according to Tmobile).Phone was great: Although it had a flaw: When I imported my 13,500 sms messages, it lagged really bad switching from individual sms view back to the list. No clue why it did that with quad-core processor! Could have been defective, but unlikely. Not sure what to think of that.Quite large: Will take getting used to. Not suitable for 1-handed use.Great phone otherwise. Returned and will buy one properly banded for my network (I'm switching to Verizon anyway)",2012年12月14日 在美国审核
Great Phone If You like the Big Screen,"Specs:Samsung Galaxy Note | Samsung Galaxy Note 2Display Size: 5.3″ | 5.5″Display resolution: 1280×800 | 1280×720Display type: Super AMOLED | Super AMOLEDDisplay PPI: 285 | 267Main chip: dual-core Snapdragon S3 (USA) | Exynos 4412 quad-coreRAM: 1GB | 2GBInternal storage: (GB) 16 | 16, 32, 64microSD slot: Yes | YesBattery capacity: 2500mAh | 3100 mAhBack Camera: 8 Megapixel | 8 MegapixelFront Camera: 2 Megapixel | 1.9 MegapixelNetwork: LTE | LTEDimensions: 5.78 x 3.27 x 0.38 | 5.95 x 3.17 x 0.37Weight (oz): 6.28 | 6.35Although the display size is larger (increased from 5.3"" to 5.5"" ), the Galaxy Note 2 is narrower and taller than its predecessor (decreased from 3.27"" to 3.17"" - heightincreased from 5.78″ to 5.95""). The general shape is similar with a slightly thinner and heavier body (from 0.38"" to 0.37""- from 6.28 oz to 6.35 oz).The narrower form factor probably aims at making the device (a bit) easier to operate with one hand, as many people are highly sensitive to this characteristic in a smartphone. Now, it is possible to type with the thumb holding the Note 2 in the palm, and I have mid-sized hands. With the previous model, it is also ""possible"" but very uncomfortable, and reaching the keys at the far left of the keyboard was a challenge.The U.S version, just like the European version, gets a physical home button at the bottom of the screen, unlike the previous Galaxy Note model available in the U.S which featured exclusively touch sensitive icons for the Menu, Home, Back and Search commands. The Menu icon is placed at the left of the Home button and on the right, you will find the back icon, like on other recent Galaxy smartphones.In my opinion, the back button should always be on the left of the device, since web conventions has long established the browser back button to be on the upper left of the window. LG and HTC for example place the back icon at the left of the home command on their smartphones. This is not so important since most users will learn very quickly the placement of all commands, but some consistency would be good.Overall, the build quality of the new Galaxy Note 2 is better than the older model.Similarly to the Note 1 and the Galaxy S3, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 chassis is enclosed in a silver frame that covers all four sides of the device. You will find the power button on the right side and the volume button on the left side. The micro USB connector is located in the middle of the bottom side with the S-Pen on its right. Theaudio jack is placed at the top,on the left.The camera lens is integrated in the upper/middle of the back side with the LED flash on its left, just like on the previous model. The silver frame around the camera lens is slightly curvy, which is different from the square shaped frame on the original Note. The Galaxy S3 gets its LED on the left side of the camera, while its speaker is placed on its right. The loudspeaker on the Galaxy Note 2 features the exact same grid than the previous model, and it is placed at the exact same spot, on the back, bottom left.All the shapes used for the design language of this product are very consistent with the latest Galaxy S3 smartphone, making it a highly recognizable as part of the Galaxy brand.By introducing the phablet category, Samsung knows that it is reaching the outer-limit of what people can tolerate in terms of mobility and portability. The fact is: the average human hand size won't change for the foreseeable future. However, the Samsung Galaxy Note is also the most comfortable touch handset out there when it comes to watching movies, typing on the keyboard, or simply ready text, which is much more agreeable than it is on a 3.5"" or a 4"" display.Your experience with the Galaxy Note 2 depends on how much you like using your handset with one hand. It is clear that with a large screen, it is not possible to have a tight grip on your handset, and easily tap/slide with one hand. If you are used to do a lot of things with one hand, this may be a deal breaker. Surprisingly, this didn't bug me 90% of the time, and I was always able to make things work. On the other hand, the benefits of having a large display are omnipresent.That is the reason why Samsung puts significant efforts to improve the one-handed experience: the device is thinner and narrower than its predecessor, and, on the software side, a few features specifically designed for one-handed operation have been added. You will find One-handed operation options in the settings, that can display a smaller phone dialer and a smaller Samsung keyboard that can both be positioned either on the left or right side. You can also get a modified Samsung calculator app and the unlock pattern can be resized (although I did not find how for that last one).What's new compared to the previous Galaxy Note? (Very Good)As described in the introduction and in the specifications list, the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 has been beefed up on all sides (processor, RAM, latest version of Android) to provide top-notch performance. Just playing with it right out of the box it was easy to notice that it is way faster than its predecessor. We will review in detail the performance compared to other competitive devices in the Performance paragraph.New S-Pen Stylus (Excellent): The most significant addition of the Galaxy Note 2is the enhancement of the S-Pen, which is also featured in the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet that we reviewed recently. The S-pen now features 1024 level of pressure sensitivity, up from 256 levels in the original Galaxy Note. The difference with the old S-Pen is huge and it feels way better, now you can modulate your strokes very subtly when you draw with any painting tool. Samsung added a few new feature to use with the S-Pen:Sliding the S-Pen out turns the display on (very good): When the Note 2 is asleep, as soon as you slide the S-Pen out of its compartment, the displays turn on, which is neat.1024 pressure sensitivity levels (excellent): The S-Pen with 1024 pressure sensitivity levels was introduced first with the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I spent a few hours playing with it using Photoshop and it is a blast! The high sensitivity makes it feels almost like a real pen with multiple tip styles available (pen, brush ...)Battery life (very good)Overnight battery depletion: Just like its predecessor the Galaxy Note LTE, the Galaxy Note 2 battery life is very good, well the capacity has been increased from 2500mAh to 3100 mAh, it's awesome. It's not uncommon for LTE devices to lose up to 25% of their battery life overnight. Even the RAZR Maxx loses 14% of its huge 3300mAh battery overnight. But the Galaxy Note 2 LTE only loses 6% of its 3100 mAh overnight (9 hours, 4G LTE on, GPS off). That is definitely a good surprise.Intensive usage: I played a HD video for one hour and the battery dropped from 80% to 67 % - which is 13% per hour with intensive use. Knowing that battery depletion is linear we can calculate that the battery will last roughly 7 hours and 40 minutes while watching videos non-stop.Enhanced cropping with the S-Pen (interesting)On the original Galaxy Note it was possible to crop a screenshot but you had to capture it first. With the new S-Pen you can now clip images directly from any application without capturing a screenshot simply by holding the button on the S-pen and trace a line around the area you would like to clip.Then, the clipped image is displayed large on screen and it will save automatically to the clipbaord if you do not perform any action. You can always copy the clipped image to one of the four application that are displayed at the bottom of the display. The clipboard is accessible from a number of applications directly from the keyboard by holding the keyboard options button.I wish it would be possible to turn on an option to draw straight edges to the cropped area, I was not able to get a perfectly rectangular clipped picture.Enhanced S-Pen features: You can personalize your email with a handwritten signature or a drawing done with the S-Pen. In the calendar, when in month mode you can annotate or draw on important dates. In the Polaris Office app you can annotate PowerPoint documents.Airview is the brand name that Samsung gave to the hovering capability of the S-Pen: the Galaxy Note 2 can detect the S Pen even when it is held a centimeter from the screen.This particular feature can be used in different contexts in various applications: it allows to preview a thumbnail of the video from its timeline in the video player app, preview a photo gallery or preview an email just by hovering the S Pen above the screen. Airview provides a critical feature found in all computers: mouse hovering. Airview works also in a number of websites that support hovering actions (especially with Flash sites), according to Samsung, you can try it at samsung.com, porsche.com and amazon.com.CONCLUSION:The Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is one of the best 4G LTE device that we had the opportunity to test (the LG Optimus G, the iPhone 5 or the Galaxy S3 would be contenders for that title), and the combination of a large 5.5"" screen, LTE speeds and a good battery life makes this a rather unique and efficient combo.With the enhancement of the S-pen, the Galaxy Note 2 becomes a real interesting tool for creative people, it can now really be used for drawing, additionally editing photos with the S-Pen in Photoshop is a joy.I personally enjoy to use the Galaxy Note 2 as a phone that acts like a tablet, surely because I carry it in my purse. Consuming content of any kind on that device is very comfortable, whether reading a book, browsing desktop version websites or watching movies.Of course, it is up to you to decide if the large format work for you or not, but from what we've seen people either love it, or won't consider it at all, so this should to be an easy decision.",2012年12月6日 在美国审核
I can't believe it...,"This is probably the best phone I've ever owned. The onboard speaker is loud clear and awesome. I have never before been inspired to load my own custom ringtones until now. In addition to having a great speaker, this phone is feature rich. The multi window is great cruzin while in google maps, to watching youtube or surfing the internet. The few things I dont like about this phone is that there is not a scroll button. You have to pin point with the stylist. I loved the G1 scroll wheel, the G2 touch pad, but this samsung is lacking a button to scroll. It also has a oversized keyboard in landscape mode. I hope in future updates they make it a little smaller. I thought moving from a physical keyboard to an onscreen keyboard would slow me down, but it doesnt. I havnt missed my physical keyboard one bit with this phone.The camera is amazing, and take about as good of shots as you can take with a digital camera. There are so many things to love about this phone that I cant name them all. Best upgrade of my life.",2013年1月29日 在美国审核

Laptop that can read your mind!,"This phone is more powerful than my wife's desktop computer! It is less of a phone and more of a personal data genie. It has all the cool features that you could want. Some of the cool ones I have noticed so far:- Text (if you are doing something and someone sends you a text the first line will show up on just the top of the screen for a sec. This way when some jerk says ""ok"" at the end of a conversation you don't have to stop what you are doing to go open up your messages and find out he said ""ok"". Awesome!)- Face unlock (the phone can see your face and unlock itself. not new, just cool)- Picture burst (takes 20 photos in like 3 seconds - my DSLR can't do that, it takes only 8.)- Multi tasking (use several things at once, thank you quad core processing)- Netflix! (screen has the same resolution of netflix max streaming resolution)- GPS (it is good, really good)- Speed (this phone is sooooooooooo fast. Nothing can touch the speed, I was downloading a game at over 2500kbps on my wifi. There is never lag in any function)- Apps for EVERYTHING (that's just android, not really the phone)- Games (they are sick! The screen and processing power combine for an unreal experience. Check out Need For Speed from EA $7. WORTH IT.)What can it not do? I'm not sure yet, just came in today from ATT. I don't think there is much it can't do. Ease of use is just super on this thing. All the features are easy to use, find, understand, etc.I was attracted to this phone because of the size. I'm a big guy 6'2"", big hands, so it fits me well. Maybe if you are small it isn't the phone for you. However, most people, including me, will be using both hands with it most of the time anyway so I think it is good for little people too.Last thought, I have used a lot of phones and computers. I have top of the line stuff including apple stuff. This is as good as or better than anything out there. If you have PC DO NOT BUY iPhone! Get one of these, or a GS3. Your life will just be easier. My wife has the ipad 3, so she got the iPhone 5. It is also very cool, but for me size wins out. I think the note II is just way cooler than iPhone 5.

Samsung GalaxyNote 2-Best Smart phone for people with low vision,"I am legally blind (vision 20/200)and have been searching for years for a phone that would work well for me.I have found it!!The screen is huge, which helps tremendously but is not the best feature. Font sizes go beyond Large to Huge, soI can read most things on my phone without also holding up a magnifer. The default display for most screens is a black background with light text (perfect!) I loaded photos of my contacts and the large display during an incoming call makes it easy for me to tell who is calling.The voice control options are amazing and so freeing in letting me use more functions of the phone with ease.I can dictate text messages, emails, internet searches.I have to double check accuracy but it is pretty darn good and mistakes are easier to fix than trying to type all of it while holding a magnifier in front of my face using a virtual keyboard.With Driving Mode On, the phone will announce incoming calls and will announce and read text messages.This can be annoying to others if you leave it on in public but is very helpful to me in the right setting.The S Voice still has some quirks but until those are fixed, I will still enjoy the many parts that work great.(Check my schedule, place a call, send a text message, open an app, turn a setting on or off etc.The Calander is the part with the quirks)The S Pen is very convenient for taking notes while I am on a call.I can set the font of the S pen to a thick one so I can see it.The camera is amazing and you can use voice control to snap a shot.I am looking forward to finding a good portable magnifier app to help read menus etc.It has a front facing camera as well for Skype.The phone is large but light weight, fits easily in a purse.I bought a phone case that can serve as a wallet as well.If you want to watch videos on the phone but need to hold it close to your face, the large screen combined with light weight of phone makes it comfortable.I use a Kindle to read books but believe I could probably do the same on this phone.The phone has many, many custom settings available for accessibility which I have only begun to explore. You can set a swipe of your finger to open up a screen of your choice, so no hunting.Then there are the many adnroid apps I am planning on trying out.I have read bout some which call out the next bus stop, some apps tell you what stores are near you so if shopping in a mall and you cannot see the signs nearby you can find out what is close to you.I know the scope of my review has been very narrow and this phone has powerful features for those with normal eyesight that I have not even touched on.However, as a visually impaired person, I feel like this phone has allowed me to enter the world of smartphone users on a much more level playing ground.I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Galaxy Note 2.",2013年3月9日 在美国审核

And my response was, ""I never talk on the phone, I always use a bluetooth"".I'm very high tech and will not let technology pass me by.I have to have the ""latest and the greatest"".Now... about this ""Phablet""(thats Phone + Tablet)**This thing is HUGE!! It will fit in a pocket or purse, but it is a big one.Definately not a one handed phone.**Everything that they say about it on TV and the internet is true!**Big screen, very bright and I don't even need my readers to read internet pages.**Can you say FASSSSTTTTT!Quad core processor is amazing. This is the first quad core processor in a phone.**Battery:OMG, it has a huge battery (3100 mAh) and clams a 15 hour charge without non-stop use.I am a heavy user and have not killed it in the course of a 10 hour work day, although it was down to about 30-40%.**It can run about any video format.**Flash can be loaded but have to do a ""work around"" to do it since Adobe isn't supporting it anymore.An internet or YouTube search can fix that.I did it, and it worksjust perfect.**Speakers are much louder than other smart phones.**Easily personalized**I have used it for video chat and you wouldn't believe the quality and speed.**With a proper OTG (On The Go) cable attached, you can use a USB keyboard, mouse, flash drive or portable hard drive.**Comes stock with Jelly Bean (which if you haven't used it, it is SMOOTH!)**Update for split screen multi-tasking capability is being rolled out slowly but it is coming.**Has the new updated S-Pen.This is a major breakthrough for those of us who are ""business on the go"".I am personally, still learning what all can be done with it but there is MUCH.CONS:because it is so new, a limited array of accessories and apps specifically for it but that will change.WARNING:1. Use the stock Samsung battery charger.I had a generic one in my office and it didn't seem to have enough output and it was charging very very slow.I put the stock charger on it and it charged super fast.2. Beware of aftermarket cases, pretty back covers, etc.Make sure they contain the NFC antennas, many do not and therefore your NFC communication will not work.Side note:I had only had my Galaxy 3 for about 3 months (absolutely loved it) and went into the store to see this and HAD to have it.Its everything my GS3 was plus!I had to reach deep to get it but it was worth every penny.I had the very first smart phone that ran Windows Mobile, and I thought I was all that and then some.I have had about 9 I think.Once you use a smart phone you'll never be able to go back to a non-smart one.NOW, having this BIG screen.... hummmmm, guess I'll just be stuck with this one until they come out with the Note 3.Can't imagine not having this big screen after only less than a week.",2012年11月14日 在美国审核
Basically a pocket computer,"I've had the note 2 for about 6 months now, and while it's not perfect, it's pretty amazing. We all know it's huge and it's got a lot of processing power, but here are some things, good and bad, that stand out to me.The good:-Snote isnice, it's kind of like the post it notes you can use on your pc.-Split screen feature is pretty sweet, could use more support-Navigation is stellar (not really specific to this phone, but yeah I looove it)-All the different camera options like best face are great, why don't real cameras have that?-Nice, easy to use UI. I feel like it's pretty user friendly, I love the pulldown ""notices"" menu you can use at any time to see updates, texts, missed calls etc.-Spen surprisingly good, I've never used a stylus with anything, I find myself using this all the time, for swipe, for games, for shortcuts etc.-Streaming music is a breeze-Not sure if this is a plus for everyone but this phone integrates social media incredibly wellThe bad:-Gorilla glass...supposed to be pretty strong, and I've babied this phone, yet the gorilla glass is still getting scratched up. Get a screen protector.I also have a small crack in the corner of the screen, had it in my front pocket, too tight I guess? It's just above the bottom left corner, not sure if that location is significant in any way.-Battery, started off amazing for the first couple weeks, never let it drop to the ""unsafe"" levels of charge, but I did leave it charging all night. Now, even with gps/wifi off I can drain a battery within 6hours if I'm using it off and on most of the day. I'm not sure if that's normal, but I dislike the idea of having to actually charge during the day instead of just at night. With the screen off/phone idling, it barely consumes any power at all...I guess that screen really just eats up batteries...-Svoice is counterintuitive, you can't have it set up to activate from any screen or while the screen is off. Why have a voice program if you have to physically navigate to a certain screen just to use it? At that point you're just saving 1 more navigation step. Once you're actually in it, it's actually pretty laggy...this might be the only thing my phone has experienced performance issues with...kind of weird. That aside it's marginally reliable anyways, half the time you'll get what you want, the other half you'll be typing in what you wanted to do after mucking around with svoice for a couple of minutes.All in all I'm extremely happy with this phone, it has managed to fill the role of tablet, emergency camera, and phone for me, which is exactly what I wanted. My only significant gripe is the screen durability, but my screen still looks amazing even with the few blemishes I've gotten in the last half of a year.",2013年3月15日 在美国审核
is that a phone in your pocket?,"or are you just happy to see me?Seriously, the first time I used this phone as such, I felt like I was holding a waffle up to my face.Relax - you get used to the size very quickly and it pairs with any BT headset on the market.Also, it is a heck of a great cellphone with good ( although not great) reception, clear audio on both sides and has Samsung's awesome dialing enhancements.How refreshing - a cell phone that is a great phone.The irony here is I bought the phone for every reason besides that and it is freaking awesome.Web browsing, texting (Samsung allows you to squish the keyboard over towards one side making one handed operation a reality), email, media - all of these are just the best I've experienced.Thanks to quad core processing and plenty of RAM, it's a powerhouse device.The new iPhone 5 is remarkable until you hold it next to my new GN2 at which point you realize that yes, size does matter.And the SGN2 has that in spades.Overall, I love it.And haven't really even learned all the tricks the S pen is capable of yet. Although I was on the phone today and instead of having to try to memorize a number someone gave me or frantically search for scrap paper, I pulled out the stylus, WROTE the info down quickly in real time and was done.Oh, and it's wonderful to have voice and data simultaneously on Tmob unlike my wife's VZW iPhone 5.Forgotten how annoying that is.But the SGN2 is just a groundbreaking device.Being just a little less wide than the original note changed everything - it's easy to handle (and I have pretty small hands) but just destroys any other device when it comes to display.The quality is outstanding and the quantity?Pffft - there's no competition.Most of what I use my cell phone for now revolves around reading and the note 2 is just the best device I've ever owned for doing that.LOVE IT!!!!",2012年11月6日 在美国审核
Amazing!,"This is, hands down, the best phone I have ever had! I purchased it new from Verizon on a 2 year upgrade last year, and since then it has been my power-house of productivity. It was a huge shift from the iPhone 4 I owned prior to this, that was so limited in what it could do that I was having to find a work-around every time I turned around. Eventually, it just became frustrating- so I got this. The Galaxy Note 2 is meant to do one thing: exactly everything you want it to do.The S-pen is a nice, intuitive touch. When I first got the phone, I was surprised by the fact that it was exactly like the old, hard tipped stylus' use to be, and yet, somehow, it works flawlessly with my capacitive touch screen. The features that come with the pen are incredible as well- give it just a couple of days, and the phone seems to learn you handwriting, making it so that everything you write is nearly flawless. Nearly. However cool, it is somewhat inconvenient to write your text messages instead of simply typing it in.My most favorite features of the phone are, by far, the ones Google has integrated straight into Samsung's TouchWiz OS. By long pressing on the menu button, you will pull up your Google, which includes Google now, and intuitive searching. In an instant, make a phone call, find an app, the weather, or even your way home if you happen to have gotten lost.Also integrated into the Samsung keyboard is Google's voice-to-text. Over time, as you speak to your phone more, Google will learn to recognize your voice, improving accuracy and making life just that much easier. This feature can be enabled or disabled through the options in the Google Now app (the app that pops up when you long press of the menu button from the home screen).The Smart gestures of the phone are another interesting, and stunning feature that Samsung has included. Reading something and don't want your screen to go to sleep? No problem, your phone can sense when you are looking at it so that the screen wont time out! In a meeting when suddenly you get a call from Joe? Quickly shut off the sound by turning your phone over, or placing your hand over the screen. Your new Galaxy Note 2 will also come with a variety of lock options, including the ability to unlock at the sound of your voice, unlocking when it sees your face, or a mix of any of the locking options available.Now, just a disclaimer: This voice is still an electronic device, and no electronic device is going to be 100% flawless. Sometimes the phone will bug out, and you'll have to restart it. This does not mean the phone is bad, or broken, just simply struggling. It was made by humans, after all, and so long as humans have flaws, so will the things we make.Be careful of the apps your download. If your phone starts acting bugging, restarting on its own, acting unusual, being slow, simply go back and get rid of the last couple of apps you got, and it may fix the problem.All in all, this phone is excellent! 5 out of 5 stars for an incredibly intuitive device- Samsung seems to have thought of everything, and packed it in to this single power-house of a phone!",2013年10月1日 在美国审核
Very happy,"Disclosure I did not buy from this seller, had to buy from Docomo (I'm stationed in Japan) but I went here to Amazon for my reviews and was appreciative of them.Phones we have had over the years: Original Moto Driod, HTC incredible, Driod Bionic, Blackberry,Driod X, iPhone 4s (iPad 2, Nexus 7, Xoom, ASUS Transformer all in the house).I tried owning the iPhone 4s, because most people that have iPhones would give their life up for Apple so I had to try it out.Had it for 4 months, and it wasn't for me.I think the iPad is better than all if not most Andriod tablets but not the phone.I have had andriod since before 2.1 and have seen the changes.iOS is VERY fluid and operates well.That being said Jelly Bean (4.1+) is just as fluid.I am a large multi-tasker and crashed my iPhone 4s many times, meaning I have pushed the iPhone to the limit.I asked some of my iHeads what tricks they had, there were none they were just happy I was using my phone well.Some apps did look prettier on the iPhone because of the developer.Things that made me break my contract and switch to this phone was the screen size, widgets, customizable OS (having multiple programs be able to open/share my pdfs or pictures, more efficient keyboard etc), free apps, NOTIFICATIONS, and Google's products: gmail, calendar (the widget and month view are why I finally switched I missed a meeting with Apple's calendar) maps, voice etc, that I love and are better experienced on the android.But if you are wondering iPone vs Andriod look to other reviews. I think it is helpful to state where you come from to give a perspective, slightly more bias toward android but obviously not completely.iPhone 5 is lighter than the 4s and slightly bigger but very narrow!The 4s seemed like this glass square that was going to shatter on the next drop.My debate was going between the Galaxy S3 or the Note II.95% of what I do on my phone is the internet, if you include texts then probably 99%.I am in Japan and my calls are per min and if I'm going to call the US I'm using Ooma.I wanted more screen size to read easier. Looking at the Note 2 it is big especially compared to the S3.I'm 6'8"" (which all `big people' reviews loved this phone) and I can barely wrap my fingers completely around so they touch. If you can palm a basketball you must own this phone it's a no brainer.Use your size for good.Normal sized people can enjoy this masterpiece as well! It is slightly faster than the S3 (which I think is the perfect screen size for the masses. I would hit the wrong letter often on the small iPhone 4s and the 5's width isn't bigger). In your hand it doesn't feel as big as it looks.Tactile illusion? Although everyone always asks is that an ipad mini? There are options to make things like the keyboard smaller for 1 handed operations.I switch between 1 and 2 and don't mind the large keyboard but again, you can customize this phone to you.It fits in my pockets easily, that wasn't a concern as I have a nexus 7 that can fit easily.The iphone would spin in my pocket horizontal anyway and take up the same space, if not more because this phone would be difficult to spin in a pocket.I'm someone though when I sit down I hate things in my pockets and take everything out.Also you know where it is and don't accidently put other things in that pocket!The software seems just as fast if not smoother than my iPhone.I've seen video comparisons but now it's getting really too close to call.I didn't know if the S-pen would be something I would use and I still don't know if I would miss it.I think my kids like it more than anything.That all being said the MULTI-window-multi task is phenomenal! The pop up window browser is a great idea to quick get info. I encourage you to look at the videos showing this. All the android options save 2 or three touches per app it seems but that all adds up. If you have a BB or an android the LED is awesome. No more turning on the phone to see if anyone contacted you.I also have a different sound for every notification email txt msg etc so you can let it lapse.Google now is a great feature that you must see that is on all 4.1 Jell Bean phones and tablets.Chrome is great how bookmarks and search history are synced so that you can open your tabs that are open on your desktop or phone or tab.This is on the iPhone but it's over the top of safari's engine.I am very impressed with the Camera. It has a lot of options and takes pictures very quickly. I used to be jealous of the iPhone for that specific function now it seems to be similar. I think it is faster and quality is about the same.If you care about quality bring your SLR. The S3 looks and seems to be the same phone and I went with this guy because it was slightly bigger and the S-Pen seemed like a cool feature that I could get used to.In a meeting using the pen to jot down a note makes it look more professional than typing on the phone, because it looks like you are texting etc.Well with the note 2 the top screen could be a chat and the bottom screen notes!Things I don't like: the main button, I'd prefer having the Google black bar at the bottom, although the absence of this helps with more screen size in landscape which is why I think they did it. But Jelly Bean and ICS have the multitask button right there where the note you have to press and hold the main button. I do like having the back button on the right side because I'm right handedNow the next question for me is do I get a surface or the Galaxy Note Tab?",2012年12月23日 在美国审核
Not so big after all,"When I was first looking for a new phone, I didn't really give much thought in the Note 2 simply because it was so big. It didn't look practical to carry around let alone use it for just for web surfing or phone calls.I even had the S3 for about a month before getting the Note 2 and I really liked the S3. Anyways, I decided I'd give it a try because I was in need of a new phone.All my concerns about size and practicality were proven wrong after just using it for a day.I really really love this phone.It is the BEST phone I ever had and I do not regret getting this one bit.The screen size is perfect for web surfing which I do frequently.I have an iPad 2 as well and I used to use it a lot more but I find myself more and more using the Note because the its just right in my pocket and the screen size is large e nough for me to not get annoyed of zooming in and out on other phones.The screen quality itself seems to be slightly more dull than the S3 but its hard to notice if you blast the screen to full brightness. The battery life is awesome too.I used to have to download apps to do some battery saving but I can surf the web, play some games and watch an episode or 2 on netflix without having to charge my battery for most of the day.There is probably just one down side which is the pen that is included.I find that the pen is just way too sensitive.At times I will be 1/2 an inch away but it will still think I'm touching the screen.It's a little annoying and probably my biggest pet peeve - so much so that I hardly ever want to use it.It's hard to find reasons too though for me.Other than that, this is an amazing phone.I don't think I would want to go back to a smaller screen after having this phone. It's just too fun to use.",2012年12月11日 在美国审核
Fantastic phone but performance degrades after some time,"[Update Nov 21, 2014]: after 2 years, performance has degraded significantly especially after Version 4 of Android came in. It became so annoying and laggy that I have decided to switch to Google/LG Nexus 5 with stock Android.Been using the Note 2 for 18 months now and still love it. I am a very heavy business user and a play lot of multimedia during my time off and the phone delivers better than expected.The battery is now showing signs of age but is still way better than any iPhone and still keeps going for a full business day. This is normal though as every battery has a number of charging cycles.The only complain for me now and it is was known thing when I got it is the lack of 4G which will probably make me buy another phone pretty soon",2014年4月5日 在美国审核

The battery life is so superior I can't seem to b able run it down in a day even running the hotspot all day.If there was anything Samsung could do to make this phone better I have 3 suggestions -Give us an option to adjust screen a little brighter. The battery has plenty of spare juice to handle it.Slim up the bezel on the sides just a tad.Maybe make a special edition built with a little stiffer material yo",2012年12月31日 在美国审核
"If you expect customer service, don't buy this phone","Purchased this phone from amazon back in December 2012. Initially no problems, the phone was working great, about couple months ago, when I switch cellular carries, I had to switch my sim card, and then nightmare with Samsung got started....For some reason, the phone was not reading my sim card. Initially I though, it is because of my new cellular phone carrier that the Samsung Galaxy Note II does not support, so no big deal, I can switch to another carries, however when I switch to another carrier, the phone again does not read the sim card. I though maybe the problem is simple and can be fixed without bothering Samsung Customer Service so I took it to certified repair shop and the repair shop told me that the the phone does not read the sim card and there is no way knowing why it does not read it and fixing the slot for the sim card is almost impossible as the sim card slot is integrated with the motherboard of the phone. The repair shop returned the phone back to me saying it is unfixiable. I though that the repair shop is not really experienced, anything can be repaired nowadays, so I am not worried. I took the phone to another repair shop and they said that the same thing as the first repair shop. If the phone does not read the sim card, the problem is very likely relate with the communication between sim card and the motherboard of the phone.After wasting a month or so with cellular phone repair shops, I called Samsung Customer Service. My phone was under warranty after all. It has been less then a year. Only couple months from the date of the purchase. Samsung Customer Service was very polite however said that they can not help me... I asked them why, and their answer was very puzzling. They told me that my phone is international unlock and it belongs to South Africa and I need to contact them to get it repair. I politely asked them to provide South Africa Samsung customer service phone number so I can contact them to send my phone to South Africa to get it fixed. They said they don't have their phone number but they will transfer my call to another customer service to see if I can get help. The phone did not go through...I called again....This time they transferred...I explained what happened again and new customer service rep told me that, I can not send my Samsung phone to South Africa either as they have no way of verifying if I am the original buyer. I was the original buyer from amazon.com. The product came was brand new.I tried to explain them, that this is Samsung phone and I paid close to $600, the phone is still under warranty. I would be careless if the phone came from a different country or planet, it is your phone and I need your support. They repeatedly told me that there is nothing can be done as this is an international unlock phone and USA customer service of Samsung does not support and they are unable to tell me which Samsung worldwide branch can support. Apparently calling Korea would not help me either as they said they won't help me. I literally begged them to show me a way to get this phone fixed. I can even pay for the fixing cost, but again they sincerely apologized for not being helpful. Later on, I tried different customer service rep by calling their USA number but each time I got pretty much same result and now I am trying to sell this phone on Craigslist as for parts.If phone works, no issues, I know it is a great phone however if somehow you experience the same problem as I did, do not expect any support from Samsung. For USA phones, maybe no problem to get support but international unlock Samsung Phones seems problematic to get support.

Update: first trip without a laptop computer,"This past weekend, I had my first trip without a laptop computer. Not only could I leave my computer at home, I had excellent all around functionality in a single device that was on my person at all times.Whether in my hotel room or on foot in Manhattan, I was able to realize the true power of the Note II. During the day, I was able to extensively use the Google Maps function.At night, the large screen provided an excellent way to read text on web sites.My one complaint is that 4G was seldom if ever available. When it was, such as at Midway airport in Chicago, I was getting 30 MB/second.*************The most important issue that any prospective customer should understand about the Note II is its size limitations are far outweighed by the benefits. Specifically, 1)it fits in a jacket or pant pockets and 2) can be operated single-handedly by someone of average height.At the same time, the 5.5 inch screen allows for reading mainstream websites in native form.It may look odd at first but just remember how large early mobile phones were. The Motorola DynaTAC weighed 4.3x as much as the Galaxy Note II does today. At 179 grams, it weighs 41% less than an iPad Mini and 63% more than an iPhone 5.While I love my iTunes on my iPod Nano, my extensive music library and podcast list stays with me on my iPod Nano with lanyard headphones. No iPhone can supplant this setup, especially when exercising. If I want to watch full-length video, the screen size of the Note II is worth more to me than the convenience of iTunes.Again, the cost benefit makes sense for my use case.With GPS and mapping, a larger screen offer inherent benefits.Yet, Google is far ahead of Apple when it comes to built-in bicycling and walking directions along with indoor navigation of large buildings.Recently, Google embarked on Street View Trekker, which employs sophisticated navigation-surveying backpacks that their employees use to map natural wonders, such as the Grand Canyon, on foot.Apple is WAY behind on the non-automobile navigation, which is important for many urban dwellers.On a separate note, my shopping experience with Sprint is mixed. There was no clear evidence that I purchased a phone on my account.No confirmation email was ever sent (checked spam folder). Sprint still appears to have best data plans pricing with perhaps the lowest quality LTE network for now.I hope the new Japanese owners inject some capital to improve the network.Fortunately, Sprint has not forced the offensive Nascar application on Galaxy Note II owners as it did with earlier smartphones.Lastly, I am glad to see Samsung employing NFC (near field communication).Apple and other major phone makers should have installed NFC years ago.All research suggests the delay is due to squabbles over credit card transaction revenue.In the future, NFC-enabled phones such as the Note II will be your car keys, house keys, credit card and transit pass.Pros:90% more screen area than iPhone 5Weighs 41% less than iPad Mini, 72% less than iPadNFC includedMicroSD slotCons:Looks strange in front jean pocketNo wireless chargingNiche applications often delayed on Android as Apple IOS given priorityTips:Order accessories ahead of time from Internet at ¼ the price of retail",2012年10月28日 在美国审核
Despite all the hoopla...,"I originally bought my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 from Newegx, but for some reason when I sent my opinion to get added to the other reviews, it never got posted which is probably because of what you are about to read. Since they wouldn't let me post my opinion over there, I decided to share it here. The transition switching from an iPhone (IOS) to the SGN2 (Android) was a little bumpy, but well worth the change. Despite all the great things already said, this phone does have one big caveat. You see, it slipped off a coffee table about 18"" from the floor onto a tiled floor after having it for about 2 weeks and ended up cracking a small part of the front glass even though I had a Nillkin case on it. The phone was still in perfect working condition and the damage is purely cosmetic.Since I'm located in the US, I called Samsung USA about repairing the screen and had to give them my IMEI #, but they couldn't locate it on their database because this was an unlocked phone so they directed me to their International Division. After calling the 800 number, I was informed that I had to call one of the two of their nearest authorized repair centers that were located in Canada. Whaaat?! At this point I gave up. It was too much of a hassle calling one person to the next so I decided to leave the phone in its current cracked state. I assume I could have gotten it repaired, but chose not to deal with the currency exchange and paying to ship the phone out of the US at my expense.So long story short, if you ever need service or repair to this phone, Samsung USA will not support it. There are cell phone repair vendors in the mall and the like, but I would have preferred a local Samsung service center since it was still covered under warranty. I would have had to pay for the labor costs, but at least it would have been done to their specs.The only way you would get SGN2 service/repair support is if the phone was sold and subsidized in the US which is ridiculous because this International GN2 has the same hardware as the US one does.",2013年1月9日 在美国审核
Samsung Galaxy is The Shining Star,"I am amazed with the new Samsung Galaxy Note II (SGN II) that features a lot of unique options. SGN II has great characteristics. It has a remarkable display, camera, S-pen, and multi-tasking screen. This device has the largest screen out of all smartphones which is 5.5 inches, with super HD AMOLED display. The screen produces pictures in such clarity because AMOLED displays have faster pixel switching response times than do traditional OLED displays. Also, its 8MP camera is great in capturing and recording because it features with many options. For instance, SGN II has face detection modes, panorama modes, burst shots, scence mode, filters, and many more.Likewise with SGN II recorder, that contains the same features with three options for recording mode that are: normal, fast motion, and slow motion. Besides that, SGN II came armed with an S-Pen which makes SGN II very creative compared to an IPhone 5. This pen allows SGN II users to draw and write on its screen and it gets typed, no matter how bad your hand writing is, SGN II recognizes the word and types at the same time. In addition, SGN II is the only smartphone that features with a multi-tasking mode, which allows you to use two applications at once by splitting the screen into two halves for each application. For example, you can watch a movie on Netflix and check your e-mail at the same time.A lot of people avoid SGN II due to its gigantic size. However, SGN II's size is not a huge problem since it has a lot of great features. I have been using it for over a months and I have never had an issue with its size, because the phone is very light, and comfortable.

Great Phone,"I bought my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 through my carrier (T-Mobile) almost 1 year ago and I love it. I, for one don't have a computer. So I use my note 2 for everything. The large screen is great for watching videos on youtube or downloaded movies. I don't use the S Pen all that much, but it's still a great option to have.Only drawback I have is the charging. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the phone or the charger itself. There are times when I'll connect the charger and the light (to indicate the phone is charging) will not turn on. So I've tried using other outlets and the same problem persisted. Other time I've attempted to charge my phone and it literally takes 24 hours for my phone to charge 75%. Currently when I charge my phone it's up to 100% within a few hours (like it should be). I've never contacted support because each time I'm about to, everything is okay.I highly recommend get the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. I hopefully within the next 6 months will upgrade the the Note 3. However, if you're looking for something a little cheaper, but still new, this is a great way to go.**I would advise you to go to a store and get a feel of the size of the phone before buying.",2013年12月21日 在美国审核
"innovative, fast and very fun","First of all let me state that my previous cellphone buying habits have been dictated by the relesse dates of apple's iphones. When the 5 came out I didn't initially question its superiority untill I was talking about buying one with my upgrade to a friend and he steered me away, pointing out the lack of innovation and processing power. I decided to take a risk and go for the galaxy note 2 and I am very thankful me and my friend were able to talk before I bought the 5. The note 2 is exactly what the iphone 5 is not. It is a rebellion agaisnt the lack of innovation and risk taking that apple has sadly fallen into. First things first,the stylus: while many would think of this as a relic from the Palm pilot era it is re designed in a way that fits more modern day tasks and its functionalities are endless. You can write a paper with it or draw a picture, but the best part of it is that it works in nearly all apps eg. Angry birds, snapchat etc. Making it a valuable tool for apps which allow you to draw with your finger. The processor speaks for itself. Its so fast you'd swear you were using a computer. This is really what the device is, a miniature computer. The claim that it is like a tablet is kind of farfetched in my opinion. It feels more like a computer/phone hybrid with a beautiful screen since you don't have the full Page size of a tablet. Onto the size; yes the thing is huge, and my friends all thought it was obnoxious and unnecessary at the get go until they got a chance to play games on it and marveled at the gorgeous screen and graphics. After a week of using it, I don't want to go back and everything else seems comically small and slow. It fits in all of my pants pockets without hassle. My favorite features are the face recognition, the s-pen hover capability and the camera, which takes incredible Pictures. Coming from an iphone I was worried about user friendliness and operating system,a concern that quickly went away, jelly bean is awesome. It is light years ahead of ios, especially when it comes to the keyboard and customizability. I recommend this to anyone who wants something incredibly fast, versatile and fun to use.Complaints: while few,the fact that the s pen cannot touch the buttons off screen (aka the back and menu buttons surrounding the home screen one) is a minor annoyance. Also if you own an apple computer and are used to the ease of syncing with itunes, brace yourself for some serious frustration. Not only can it not read some itunes files, if you want it to automatically sync your music (not have to worry about keeping track of which songs to add) you are esentially out of luck. A program called kies is avaliable although within 5 minutes of using it my mother warned me to watch my language which she was able to hear from the other side of the house. Avoid at all costs. The best way to do it is to just get android file transfer of of their website and make a playlist that keeps up with which songs you would like to add. Its just drag and drop from there!While I do miss the ease of syncing with the iphone 4 I used to have and that silent/ringer switch on the side, I would be very angry if I broke my note 2 and had to go back. As a man who has never owned a non apple computer,mp3 player or phone (while smartphones have existed) I must say that apple has dropped the ball and samsung has created a device that truly grabbed my attention and my cash, and was worth every penny.",2012年12月25日 在美国审核

The 720p resolution on this 5.3 inch screen is a welcome joy even as 2013 rolls in with 1080p resolution devices (trust me, checked out the new HTC and that screen while lovely didn't give me buyers remorse) and still stands competent enough to give lovely visuals when doing anything from gaming to Netflix viewing. The camera is solid along nice extras such as Dropbox (48 free gigs after going through their activation process) to make storage an afterthought.Speaking of which, SD storage is a go. This is quite noteworthy since the Nexus 4 was a tempting thought as well as HTC's latest 1080p phone on Verizon but both a no go due to lack of SD expansion. Thus despite this being something that's been around since the G1 some manufactures on some models choose to start omitting it on high end phones. Thus my existing 32GB from old phone card felt right at home as it slid right into this powerhouse with the peace of mind that I can later on upgrade to 64GB.Meanwhile the built in 16GB seems sufficient enough to handle some heavy app data + some of the HD vids I captured nicely enough.Touchwiz offers good &amp; bad. The good is the S-Pen functionality which is a dream to use along with S-Note for scribbling quick notes (IMO writing notes on phone while talking is more hands free encouraging then size itself lol). A couple apps I use that enables S-Pen writing on PDF's is also great with S-Pen but outside of Samsung's own apps nothing I found uses the pressure sensing functionality of it to adjust the thickness by pressing down on it, perhaps that'll change but for now a small quirk on my otherwise beautifully flawless S-Pen experience.As for the rest of Touchwiz? Eh, the launcher compared to 3rd party launchers is kinda on the yuck side. And S-Voice is utter useless trash that needs to be kicked &amp; curb stomped off this phone. While Google Now can be used by holding menu button, it's not as accessible as just double tapping the home button which defaults into S-Voice unless you're willing to do some work around fiddling on that.Other not so pleasant defaults about this phone is T-Mobile's ugly crap that hogs up Notification Bar (thankfully easily removed), and Google Wallet being a NO GO. That's right, despite the hardware being perfectly fine, NFC + Google Wallet isn't happening without rooting. This is a major reason why I'll eventually root (and might update to let you know how that goes) but for now a bummer that this is a carrier restricted cawk block that one has to hack around. T-Mobile's variant also have the multi-window functionality since X-Mas updates so while it doesn't work with all apps as of yet, being able to Youtube while reading Gmail or text or Tweet is certainly a nice thing to be enjoyed.Overall even with the cons, they pale in comparison to the overpowering beastly positives of this phone which has been a joy (especially with battery carrying me all through the day after heavy screen usage). This is pound for pound one of the best phones to own that holds up nicely even as the stampede of next generation phones start to trounce out.",2012年12月28日 在美国审核
Look for another brand,"Worst phone EVER! Verizon has replaced this phone 5 times now. .. each time with a different problem.The screen went all black,they replaced it, the phone would freeze up &amp;you had to pop the battery out in order to get it to turn back on again,they replaced it, the touch screen didn't work on one,so they replaced it with yet another note 2.And so on and so on.Now the 1 year is up &amp; the battery is heating up to around 154 degrees &amp; Verizon will no longer replace it.

"Mediocre default speakerphone, but here's the fix","EDIT January 6, 2013: I stand corrected about the mediocre speakerphone after figuring out the fix: this phone has an extra volume feature that will make it louder either in speakerphone, headset, and standard mode. To enable this you have to go to call settings in the phone app and select the ""Use extra vol. for calls"" check box. After this is enabled you will have an ""extra volume"" button in the right middle of the screen (round, no title with loudspeaker on it) displayed once the call is established.END EDITOLD REVIEW:If you also often use the speakerphone feature, you'll appreciate my two cents: iPhones aside, every other mobile phone I used in the past, including two $20 no-contract LG cheapos, leaves the Galaxy Note II in the dust with speakerphone loudness. Prior to this phone my wife and I had Samsung Galaxy Proclaim, HTC EVO 4G, LG Optimus S, two different iPhones and some low end phones.I can't comfortably talk on the speakerphone when driving on the highway because of the road and wind noise. This wasn't the case with other phones mentioned above. The only exception were the iPhone models which were even worse than the Samsung Galaxy Note II.If this is important to you, look elsewhere, otherwise it's a great phone.EDIT: Disregard the old part and see my update at the beginning of the review.",2012年12月15日 在美国审核
Previous IOS User,"When I got this phone I had been an avid apple user. Owning an Iphone 4, Ipad 4 and 2 Macs I was pretty set on picking up the IPhone 5. Then it was released and I realized how Apple had done almost nothing different to it. So, I started looking at my alternatives. I have a close friend that owned several Samsung Phones and loved them. I knew I could trust the company because I have Samsung Televisions. Anyways, the phone is great and definitely draws some attention. The first thing you'll notice about this phone is how big the screen is. It really truly is a big screen and I was little scared at first. However, you get used to it and I have learned to love it. My wife's iPhone is hard to type on now. The powerful Quad-Core Tegra 3 processor is excellent for anything you throw at it. For example, I have several emulators which includes a hefty PS emulator. The pen, screen, battery life, and astetics are all fantastic. Any android or apple lover will love this phone.",2013年8月8日 在美国审核
AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING,"Simply amazing product.Sold my original note the minute this version was announced.Phone feels super fast and snappy. The Quad Core 1.6Ghz is freaking amazing. When I view my video folder in thumbnail format, all the thumbnails play without any hitch, i.e about 8 videos simultaneously.I have had the Gmail app crash on mea couple of times but they haven't been major crashes and I haven't lost anything, am sure that's an app causing that.Phone is just the perfect size for me, I love big screens. I would probably still buy this as a phone if it went all the way to 6inches.It looks like this device will become the center of all my digital world.Everything will gravitate around my brand new notes 2 from now on. I mean everything.I love this phone so much I will probably have to insure it because it will handle everything.I read on it - KindleI shop on it. - Amazon and GoogleI browser on it - ChromeListen to lectureson it - Double TwistWatch HD movies on itI manage all my social platforms from it - HootsuiteSend and manage my business invoices from it - Zoho InvoiceShare internet from it to my iPad 2, nexus 7, blackberry bold 4, iphone, psp, macbook pro and macpro, this phone has become the center of my digital world.This phone has become my personal computer (PC) period !!!The S pen is much improved too, feels great, it also recognizes my hand writing better, best hand writing experience on a phone or tablet in my opinion.Sharing files via NFC with my nexus 7 works like a charm and its very snappy too.The screen is to die for, colour are very punchy, I have had no issues viewing the screen at 12 noon.When I got my original note a few months back, I actually said it was the best phone at the time, this phone is for me a major upgrade, an evolution, comparing the iphone (any model) to this would be a big big joke. Don't forget I own an iPhone and numerous Apple products so am being objective.The phone is not officially out here in Nigeria but I just had to get one superfast.Worth every single penny.",2012年10月19日 在美国审核
Revenge purchase,"I bought this phone a year or so ago, and I kept my Iphone to use as an Ipod.This phone is a breeze compared to the Iphone, which is nothing but ongoing problems.My husband has held onto his IPhone, but is now getting a Samsung.The problems he's had in the last two years with his Iphone is monumental, won't sync with ITunes.Seems every time he attempts to do something with the IPhone it's blocked, or stopped, just basically won't work but does not tell you what the problem is or how to fix it.Anyway, we're just a couple of old geezers, so am not tech savvy and just want something to work without having to search for hours for a possible answer that may or may not help.Way too fussy.Anyway, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this phone.It's pretty easy, and it updates itself without prompting you, so no problems there.Everything stays current.I sure love it!",2014年4月28日 在美国审核
Best Phone I have ever had!,"I have the SGN2 in white.I wanted to give a short review and will update later when things calm down in my life.This phone is stunning.I have only two bought apps and one is called anti-aquarium with fish swimming around.This phone makes that app look killer.Everything on this phone is stellar.It is very fast, no stuttering with screen changes, the 4G lite network is very fast with minimal load times on internet.Quad core is clearly fast.No comparison. Jelly Bean is awesome.The calendar is so much better than the one I had on Droid X.I just love this phone.It has face detection so screen is always faced at correct rotation.The camera without flash is not great.I took a bunch of pictures of my cat and only one was decent but it was dark.it has google popup that alerts me to weather, traffic, game scores.I used Mybackup pro to transfer pictures, Apps and contacts from old phone to SGN2.I like the white cover and will have Otterbox defender in my possession soon.Buy this phone if you are able.The phone is not all that big meaning I got use to the size in just two days.At first I thought holy crap this is big.Now I think it is just about right size for phablet.The only minor gripe is i cannot figure out how to keep screen on when plugged into charger.I have it on with docking but the screen times out.I think the next Samsung Note 3 will have higher density pixels for screen, and mabye a half inch bigger.The sound could be a little louder through the speaker phone.The ear speaker is loud.The ring tones sound great.Just buy this phone!",2012年12月5日 在美国审核
Unpleasant experience,"I bought this item 15 months ago. It was really good for almost a year until one day in Aughust 2014, Android asked for an update with the software--I did. But the phone was never the same afterwards!!It started to turn itself off on its own, even when the battery is full. It shuts off 13 times a day at least. Also it started to make problems connecting to WIFII tried everything possible, I even restored factory settings with no avail. The new damaging update is still on and there is no way it can be taken off.I wanted to contact the original seller to see if they have suggestions to the problem. This is really annoying. This device was expensive and now its efficiency is reduced to less than 30% under the present circumstances.I contacted amazon and they were really nice! they suggested that I contact SAMSUNG USA, however after contacting the office in USA, it seems that there is no way that SAMSUNG USA would help me on this because this phone is international unlock.Like one of the reviews above, there is no customer support on this item. unless you are willing to gamble with your money and accept loss in case it happens afterwards, do not buy it--reallyIf I had known it would be difficult to get to the actual manufacturers in case there was a problem, I would have bought any other item from any local store instead. At least in that case I could speak to actual people and see how they can fix an item I bought from their store.",2014年9月14日 在美国审核
Best phone I've ever owned.,"I've had this phone for about 6 months now so I have had time to get very familiar with it. I've also owned several other 'large' similarly priced smartphones, which where all great. But this one is is by far the most useful and best perfoming for many reasons. Its 3200 mah battery lasts well over 16 hours with heavy use. it is very fast and I never experience issues with freezing or lag. It has lots of options in settings to make the device perform exactly how you want it to (more than I have ever seen) I didn't think I would use the stylus much when I first got it, but it turned out to be very useful, you can hover over most things with the stylus and a dialog box will pop up with useful information and tips about whatever it is. The quick commands with the stylus make navigation quick and easy and its much simpler than I imagined it could be. The sensors on the phone are very accurate,it knows right where the stylus is above the screen and the dot projected from the stylus follows with no lag whatsoever. The multi window feature of this phone is wonderful and not restrictive at all, you can do anything you could do in full screen in both of your smaller screens, you can quickly adjust window sizes or change applications you're using, I use this feature a lot for writing emails while getting info from the internet or watching tv while being able to send texts uninterrupted. this phone is very durable, thin, and lightweight. It fits in my front pocket (with or without otter box) and would fit in anyones back pocket it can brodcast to your tv via bluetooth. The negatives of this phone are the camera being only 8mp and it only having 2gb of ram, it uses a little over half of that on just base operation,but I have found the rest to be sufficient for almost anything including streaming video from 2 sources at once. I like that to save battery I can set the screen to timeout at 5 seconds but also set it so it won't timeout while I'm looking at it. For laying in bed it can be set to flip the screen based on which way your looking at it instead of the orientation of the phone. The speaker is extremely loud, so loud my neighbors have called the cops on me for the noise. The screen is extremely vibrant and at full brightness will be responsible for about 35% of battery being used when using the phone heavily. The software is smooth and very user friendly, the call quality is wonderful, voices are crisp and clean. I would recommend this phone to anyone it's a good choice for not only experienced smart phone users but first time smart phone buyers as well. I hope this helps.",2014年3月2日 在美国审核

!00% Impressed,"No wonder Apple are worried by Samsung.This phone is superb and just by fetching the thing out of my pocket at work I have managed to sway many of my colleagues in favor of Samsung for their next cell phone up-date.It seems every every one wants a piece of the action.The product when examined by people seems to sell its self. Yes the screen is big but when you read your Kindle App ebook on that screen, see the net pages flow on it and appreciate the GPS navigation maps scrolling across it, then you forget all worries about the size of it. In fact you realise that you need that screen and nothing smaller will do.It is fast, my goodness me it is fast. Fast to open web pages, fast to react to apps, games, video etc. Fast, Powerful, smooth and intuitive.Added to this, the battery is big enough at 3100mA to last all day even under quite heavy use. Oh and the MP3 player is fantastic in both presentation and sound quality.It cost me a few dollars to insert a 64Gb flash memory card in addition to the 16Gb on board memory and I will buy a spare battery to insert if I do run it down. Apple seal off their phones and the only way to upgrade memory or change the battery after 500 charges when it deteriorates is to buy a new one, what a rip off.I have always bought Apple but with their determination to stick to a policy of in-built obsolescence and pay through the nose for memory, I really don't think I'll buy much more.I recently bought my wife the Galaxy S3 which impressed me greatly but on balance, this is even better.In short, excellent product, I couldn't be happier with it.",2012年10月17日 在美国审核

Buggy Operating System and a Bad Phone,"The Samsung Galaxy Note II is the perfect example of an over-engineered product. The user interface is way too sensitive -- I have to change back my settings on a daily basis because the interface changes just about every time I use my phone. It takes a beautiful picture, yes. The interface is nice and big for searching the internet, yes. But to make a phone call? Even when I'm extremely careful about not pushing buttons (putting my hands only on the outside rim and not on any buttons) my ear/face touches the screen and voila, I'm somehow changing my clock settings to Saudi Arabia time zone, or removing my Favorite Contacts, or turning off my Bluetooth setting. In summary, it is a terrible phone. Secondly, I find that the operating system does buggy things -- like if I change a setting, it may change back and when I go in and try to update the setting, it shows that the setting is different than it actually is. Rebooting helps, but that's so old-school Windows to have to do that all the time. My suggestion is that if you're only going to use it for its non-phone features, you'll be OK. But for me, I really regret paying so much money for this -- wish I had gone with the iPhone.",2013年6月27日 在美国审核

Fantastic,"I've had my Note II for a little over 2 weeks now (I got the Note 10.1 tablet a week later).It is fantastic!I love it.The battery life is phenomenal.The phone is beautiful, fast, and the screen is great.My 12 year old made fun of the size when we were at the store, but prefers it for watching Netflix over any other.I haven't found anything about the phone that I don't like.While using it one-handed in some cases is nearly impossible, I can still send texts when necessary with one hand.The S Pen is awesome and the S Note application that comes with it is great.It can do some really sweet things including helping my son figure out how to do the math that I can't remember. This is my first Samsung device and I like the Touchwiz (I know some don't).I used a Motorola Droid X for 2 and a half years and I like the version of Swype on this device better than on my Motorola (and I liked it on my Motorola).Having the stylus for drawing, taking notes and the extra features built into the S Pen make it great to have.With 4 different methods of input (keyboard, swype, voice, and pen), I can have it do what I need it to do when and how I need it to do it.If you want a small phone, this is not the device for you, but if you want an all-around great device that you can use for multiple purposes, this is it.I get a satellite lock within a few seconds (much, much faster than on my Motorola).Jelly Bean and the multiple windows are great for the apps that are supported by them.I definitely recommend it.",2013年2月9日 在美国审核

"Great Features, Abysmal Hardware Quality, and No Support","I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note II last November from a reputable online retailer here in the US. Last week, not even ten months after the original purchase, the phone stopped working.When I try to power up my phone, it displays the banner screen ('Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100'), but then it stops there. It never leaves the banner screen, it never dims, it's just stuck there.I've tried removing/replacing the battery, SIM card, and flash RAM card, I've tried (unsuccessfully) to get into Recovery Mode, all of these with and without the phone plugged into the charger. Nothing I try works.I contacted Samsung USA, only to be told that Samsung USA will not support the phone because it originated in the UK. When I contacted Samsung UK, they informed me that they will not support their devices when used outside their country, and advised that I contact Samsung USA or my retailer. Of course, the retailer won't help me - they didn't manufacture the product.For $645, I purchased a nice phone that served me well. Through no fault of my own, it has inexplicably died, and Samsung will not even discuss the problem with me.As you can imagine, I am extremely disappointed in Samsung. While their products are arguably the best in the Android world, their interest in their customers - and repeat business - seems to be very limited. I have never witnessed such blatant neglect of responsibility for a product this new, costing this much.Why would I ever want to buy another Samsung product - much less recommend Samsung products to those I know - if this is how they treat their customers?I own a Samsung monitor and a Samsung TV. I sure hope they last longer than my phone. Because of my experience with this phone, I have little faith in Samsung standing behind any of their products.My advice to everyone is to AVOID Samsung products.

A fantastic phone- that won't Synch. Numerous driver issues.,"I love my phone. I have had it approximately 11 months now, purchased two days after release from the sprint store.However, whatever Samsung has done to it's drivers has caused me so much wasted time and effort that I'm now typing this as a warning.This is a fresh format of Windows 7 Ultimate, with freshly updated drivers etc. Samsung provides 'drivers' in two ways: one, a minimal typical driver installation direct from manufacturer. This fails to install on Windows 7. Two, via Samsung Kies, a media device manager to provides synch funtions for your phone. This fails to connect.I've spent over 4 hours with tech support now, done countless uninstall re-install reboot cycles, FORMATTED my PC, and am still left with a phone I cannot transfer my music to anymore. Four months ago it worked. Now it doesn't.I'd return the phone now if I could.I give it 2/5 stars, only because everything else about this phone is fantastic- except I can't use anything that requires a USB connection to my PC.And yes Samsung Lovers, kies via AIR works, however I can't use Songbird to manage my music that way, it's painfully slow, KIES doesn't support importing playlists (unless WMP), nor does it support .flac (instead of MP3), and I don't think I should have to convert gigs of music to .mp3 so I can minimally use synching capability that's painfully slow.

"Perfect device, i switched from the iphone 4S and dont regret it!","Am using the global standard Note 2 for the past 3 weeks now. Its my first ever Android device. Debated for a while from switching from an iphone 4S to the note 2, as i had no ideaabout the Android's capabilities. Plus i got tired of the waitlist for Iphone 5, and the whole drama of Apple making it so difficult to get your hands on an iphone 5, even weeks after its release.So i decided to take a swing at this amazing Note 2 device. Seriously after using it for 3 weeks all other phone screens seem just way too small and make you think howyou got any work done on them at all. Emails are so nice to read, videos are absolutely amazing and reading the news on flipboard is just fantastic. Although it doesnt completelyreplace your tablet, i tend to barely use my ipad after i got the Note 2.Dont use the SPen too much, but i prefer it to make notes, edit photos and express drawings with changes.The multi window is amazing, where two apps can be opened on the screen at the same time, here the size of the phone obviously helps.Viewing your calendar with appointments is so easy on the big screen and adding and editing appointments is so much easier.Am a big apple fan, but am very happy with the switch from the iphone 4S to the Note 2.

"iphone, take a back seat - there's a new sheriff in town","My husband damaged his phone, so he so graciously took my old phone and paid for this one for me, so let me tell you I am loving him and this beautiful phone.For those who have thought it would be too big, here's a big emphatic NO, IT'S NOT TOO BIG.In fact, after 2 days of using this phone, all other phones just seem like miniature toys.I have seen the new iphones (my family members have them), but this thing blows them out of the water.The speed with this quad core processor is great. Call quality has been wonderful so far.And for the iphone lovers who use Siri - all I have to do is double press the home button on the bottom and the thing comes alive as my personal assistant.It has not failed to understand any of my requests from the very first try.I have not had time to try all the features of this phone yet (there as SO many), but I certainly have been having fun trying some of them.The video player is amazing. All the thumbnails for all your videos appear, and when you hover the S-pen over one it enlarges a bit and gives you a preview of the video with sound without actually opening it.I downloaded a couple of my favorite apps for a smartphone for watching TV.The xfinity app installed, and now my Note 2 is a great TV with HD video.I also have a Sling Box attached to my TV at home, and when I downloaded the slingplayer app it just installed without a hitch, and I immediately am watching on my smartphone whatever my Comcast cable box is tuned to, and I can change channels on the Comcast cable box with my Note 2.Again, this installed and worked flawlessly.The HD picture quality is great, and now we won't have to miss an episode of Si, Willie or Jase on Duck Dynasty wherever we are!LOL!I had been using an HTC Inspire Android phone and loved it.Of course, this new Samsung phone is running a new version of Android (Jelly Bean), but for anyone who has any experience with Android it is a pretty intuitive experience in figuring this phone out.I have no problems at all typing messages with this phone. In fact, I love the fact that the numbers are in a line above the letters and I don't have to change the symbols/keyboard to type in numbers or times.The itunes apps have nothing on Android.There are Android versions of the kids' favorite games.There are numerous Bible apps, and I love being able to whip out my Android phone to follow along in church or Bible Study. When you are on a call or in an app and you remove the S-pen a screen for taking notes appears. That is going to be useful.If you just absolutely have to have a tiny phone that will slip into your tiny, skinny jeans pocket, this phone might not be for you, but if you want to be able to have more of the benefits of a tablet that can still be put in a pocket or won't weigh a purse down, and if you want to be able to enjoy the internet, reading articles and books, watch videos, TV and movies, then take a look at this Note 2.In just 2 days, I haven't had the opportunity to use the camera/video features yet, but I look forward to this. The Note 2 is feature-rich with the camera/video, and I look forward to trying out this burst mode and perfect shot stuff that is on there.With this phone, right there in my pocket or purse I always have a game player, TV/movie/youtube player, ipod, ereader, Bible, GPS, navigator, messenger, social networking device and assistant.Oh, did I mention - it's a great phone for making calls. It is comfortable in my hand with talking on the device, but the speaker phone is so great I'm spending most of the time in the car talking on the speaker phone (safer, as well).Thanks, Samsung, for giving us the option of a bigger smartphone device. No, I don't want to be holding my ipad up to my ear, but this thing is fine, and I can't see myself wanting to go back to a little phone anytime soon. Now, if you are going to an amusement park, beach, rafting, skydiving, etc., you might want to think about having a smaller, cheaper little flip phone for those occasions, but during a routine day - I love this phone for whatever I do!Yep, there's a new sheriff in town - Galaxy Note 2.Iphone will be playing catchup with all this phone does for a long time, and I can add a memory card with whatever gigs I want without having to shell out hundreds more to Apple for more memory. If the battery ever needs changing, that can be done, and I can customize the features and files on this phone to suit me.Apparently Apple thinks one size fits all in the way of phones, but I like to be able to customize mine. I will still be using my ipad when at home, but this Note 2 will be with me wherever I go. You can admire the iphone 5, but the Galaxy Note 2 is all that and more!",2012年11月13日 在美国审核
Oh boy Samsung does it again.....,"I waited a while to write a review on this phone, I had bought the phone right before I went on vacation out of town for 2 weeks (got it the 2nd day of release) and I am blown away by this device. I was a former owner of the iPhone 4s and then I moved to a Galaxy Note (n7000) for 6 months. I was in love with the original Galaxy Note in every way possible and then I sold my old Gnote. I felt bad because I had no idea how good the Gnote 2 would be, if I would love it or hate it. I even regretted selling the Original note. I waited for the day to come and then I bought it patiently waiting day by day (bought on ebay with square trade warranty). I never thought another phone in the world could take me away from the Gnote and then it happen...The Samsung Galaxy Note 2 came along by UPS and shattered the barriers of my expectations of how fast a phone could be and could do. Once again I sit here writing you a review of my 2 weeks of the Samsung Galaxy note 2 (n7100) This Review will mostly compare it to the Original Galaxy Note (n7000).Screen and Multimedia:We already know the screen is a whopping 5""5 inches so I won't get into that. The HD Super AMOLED is what I want to get at. Its just so eye popping to look at every time you look at the Raw HD screen of the Galaxy Note II. Its hard to look away for even a moment. And Guess what? Its NOT PEN-TILE! Really once you look at the screen you will notice it! The screen itself is just so fun to look at and it is some serious eye candy. I know some people are worried about losing some res of the original Galaxy note but trust me this screen is far superior. It was worth losing that resolution in favor of this screen. This is truly the best screen Samsung have ever made. Period. If you was desensitize by the first Note Screen then your in luck because this one is even bigger (mainly longer) then before. Its going to be hard to go back to smaller screens after owning this phone. There was no problems with my screen at all, no dead pixels &amp; no funny colors/bluish tint like the first Gnote. Its a breathtaking screen simply put and it is something that have to be seen. It Decodes DVIX and Xvid movies so watching on this screen is a blast with HD, Netflix also has great quality, and Slingplayer is a wonder to watch TV on the Galaxy Note II! HD wallpapers and wonderful looking on a screen like this. Gaming on this device is pure fun enjoyment every time because you will have extra room to have your thumbs moving. (played NOVA 3, Dead Trigger, Sonic CD, and a few SNES games like TMNT Turtles in time. With those games the Colors just POP! don't believe me? Try it when you get one.) The screen was so comfortable to look at I didn't even pull out my iPad on my vacation.Design / Build Quality / feel:Yes its a big phone/tablet but really it feels nice in the hand. To me it feels so much better then the Original Galaxy Note. Its something about the design of the curves on the back of the device just feels so satisfying to hold. I know the device is plastic but it some how have a premium feel to it. It is very uncanny but its beautiful and looks better then the white version IMO. The gray mixed in with a nature like feel of the GSIII just makes the front of the device very sexy. People gave me compliments on the street saying it was ""beautiful"" This mixed in with the screen can make this a very attractive phone. It is a solid feeling phone. I can fit it in my pants with no problems because the Galaxy Note 2 is thin, light and easy to hold. If your worried about texting on this thing there is an app called ""Thumb Keyboard"" in the android market that really makes it comfortable typing. To be completely honest the Stock Keyboard even feels good to type on and very responsive...might be a little tough to reach the middle of the with the stock keyboard in landscape. Other then that its a very good stock Samsung keyboard its even better when you use the S-Pen for your handwriting. This one is also better for the front of it has a notification light, I know that's not a huge bonus to some people but after owning the iPhone 3G, iPhone 3Gs, Dell Streak, Galaxy S II, iPhone 4s and a Galaxy Note...It is refreshing to see that on there for the first time. You can change the color of the Notification light as well but it depends if an app allows you to do so such as Handcent SMS.Call Quality / data speeds / GPS / Wifi:Call quality is great and Samsung made it even better then the Original note. Speaker is WAYYYYY better then the Original Note adding a ""extra volume"" button during calls. The speaker on the Gnote was not that good to say the lease. I have HSPA+ on AT&amp;T with Unlimited Data and the Download/upload speeds are good with my area getting 7.25 Mbps in Chicago's speed test (Using a unlocked with T-mobile USA will only get you 2G speeds). The speeds are not bad but not that good compared to today's LTE speeds. Its good enough for me though but I suggests waiting for the LTE versions of this phone if your a data speed demon. Another thing I notice with Galaxy Note 2 is that all you have to do is put the microSIM card in and your good to go. It automatically sets up the APN settings for you something that was not on the Original Galaxy note. GPS locks on fast as normal and was great using it on a vacation and Wifi is working perfectly especially with range, it pulls up web pages faster then the first note I can tell you that.Battery:It Last...the 3100 mah battery just shatters the old Gnote battery. Normal usage has gotten me over 48 hours of battery life and heavy usage gotten me about 20 hours. That is just insane....it is just insane if your not use to it which I wasn't. You would think with a screen as huge as 5""5 inches and the power this phone has it wouldn't but it just surprise me how far smartphones have came from 2006. You won't be disappointed with the battery life in the Galaxy Note II.UI / Speed / Processor:Fluid. Fast. Quick. Speedy. Blazing. This phone is the FASTEST phone I have ever used. Why shouldn't it be with a Quad-core and 2GB of Ram. It even had me saying ""Is this really Android?"" because my first Android phone was a Dell Streak and look how far we come. I was shocked how fast this phone is. I mean every app I throw at it, it takes it down like a beast. This is the first time I felt like I didn't need to change roms or flash it. In fact I see myself keeping this phone stock for a very long time. Yes my friends I am in love with Touchwiz/Nature UX for the very first time. If this is project butter and the future of it then please give me more. The responsiveness of this device is mind blowing. Another thing this phone has is something called ""Page Buddy"" for Ex: when you plug in your headphones it takes you to a home screen of apps and widgets that you most use the headphones with. It does the same with the S-pen, Docking, and Roaming. It is another function that can activate something called ""Multi-view"" where you can have two apps open at the same time but they work so seamless. you can have Google Maps open while you text your friends the directions or you can browse the web while viewing a video. Its so smooth, I think this is where the Quad-core really shines.Its a limited amount of apps on the left side of the screen that you can use multi-view with but here is the list:Chrome (Once installed)ChatOnEmailGalleryGmailInternetMapsSNoteMessagingYou-TubeVideo PlayerGoogle TalkAPPS:Comes with a bunch of Samsung APPS which I found myself enjoying. Here are some of the ones I enjoy. Allshare play Connects to all the media file on my PC over HSPA+ or WiFi, It has DLNA that can connect to my Samsung TV, FM Radio that carriers love to take out for you to use their data, Paper artist that let you take a picture and draw wacky stuff over it, S-Voice which I admit is awful but its a decent clone of Siri on the iPhone, Music app is nice and of course all the fun Google stuff especially Google Now. Samsung Email app is good and so is their S-planner (calender) but its nothing to write home about unless your using the S-pen with the calender. The rest of Samsung's apps aren't good. (Gamer, Reader and music hubs are junk and so is the Samsung App store.)S-Pen:It works as it is suppose to and quicker then the original Galaxy note. This would be the one main reasons to buy the phone. As an artist I am very impressed with something like this and could be used as a backup Wacom mini tablet for on the go. The Samsung Galaxy Note II has some really awesome features besides drawing that take advantage of this Wacom pen. You can use it to write down notes, hover it over your video timeline to see whats going on later in the movie, You can use it as a ""mouse"" to hover over content your fingers can't really activate on the web, Write notes on your Calendar, Write notes on the back of pictures/photos, and so much more that I know I'm forgetting but it all just works with ease.Camera:Takes great pictures up to 8 MP and the best I've ever seen on a mobile device, the pictures are just so colorful. The pictures snaps fast and I love it, if you hold the camera button down it snaps up to 20 photos in a second (?) and it has Panorama which I enjoy using. HD Video recording is great and frame rate and looks very good when being played back on DLNA / Allshare. With a processor this fast its no longer you have to wait a second or two like one original note. I haven't tired using all of the features of the camera but I'm working my way to it like Low-light, HDR, Best shot, etc.Final word:I love this phone and to be honest with you I don't see myself using another phone for a very long time. This Quad-core beast can handle it all. I don't even take out my iPad anymore....I don't even feel the desire to buy the Nexus 7 at this point in time because this phone is just fun to use. This is now my personal on the go PC. I put in a 64GB microSD card into it (MicroSD slot another plus btw) and now I take all my movies and music along with me. Samsung has once again showed me that they can deliver a great product. I can't speak for updates but as far as I know the old Galaxy Note (n7000) is getting Jellybean as well so I expect the Galaxy note 2 to get updated with future Android updates as well.Get this phone if your interested, No I'm not going to call this a phone....Get this media powerhouse if you enjoy media consumption and want a phone along with it. I don't carry around my tablet anymore and I make phone calls with this thing. Its everything I wanted in a portable data device. I know some are worried how big it is but its really not that big of a phone. When you get use to it and its ""smaller"" then the Original Note making it easy to hold. Its easy for me to carry around but it is a two handed device so keep that in mind. There are ways to use it with one hand like the keyboard and calculator though. I enjoyed using this phone on my vacation and I didn't even use the unlocked Tethering ;) because the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 alone makes for a enjoyable experience to have around. I'm sure there are so many other things I am missing in this review but so far I love it. Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (n7100) is worth every single penny!I haven't used NFC yet so I can't comment on it but I would love Google wallet on this thing if I knew how to get it on there.I recommend a few apps in the play store with the note II:iMediaShare: (Ultimate app for DLNA users.)Thumb Keyboard: (Great keyboard for phones like this.)HD Widgets: (Wonderful weather widget that fits the note screen perfectly.)Sketchbook Mobile: (works great with the S-pen)Sonic CD: (Sonic with Amoled goodness will give you eye orgasms.)Google Navigation: (Perfect device for GPS!)HulloMail: (Visual Voice-mail)Slingplayer: (If you have a slingbox you will LOVE! this app, if you do not I recommend getting one.)Netflix: (For obvious reasons.)Chrome: (Great web browser)Mightytext: (If you love Texting from your PC)Samsung's Kies air: (Wireless Transferring of Music, Videos, Photos, and Texting from PC)Lock Screen 7 &amp; Launcher 7: (Because nothing is better then making this look like a Windows Phone 7 Device from time to time)",2012年10月21日 在美国审核
"Terrible hardware, low build quality, and a crap OS to boot!","After 8 months of owning the device, it has destroyed two 64GB memory cards. Both cards failed after a few weeks of usage, were basically loaded with media file to play. Whatever, I stopped using the phone for media. Now, on my eight month of usage, the phone has decided that it can not be charged beyond 15-17% while the phone is on. If I turn the phone off, I can charge it, otherwise it is useless. The low paid morons at the Verizon store were of no help, they would not offer to replace or repair the phone. While I didn't buy the piece of junk on Amazon, I feel compelled to warn as many people as I can about this terrible device. I'm not even going to mention all the various bugs and problems with the Android operating system. YUCK!",2013年9月1日 在美国审核
great smartphone but camera takes some getting used to.,I have been holding out for a smartphone for years because they just were not worth a data package imho. I then researched this phone and it was the perfect cross between a smartphone and a tablet. The only drawback I can see so far is the ergonomics of the camera functions. If you try to hold it like a regular camera you will find that your fingers end up on buttons on the sides of the phone. So you end up having to hold it rather awkwardly. Even worse if you have one of these covers for it. Other than that it is a real powerhouse..,2013年2月25日 在美国审核
No Samsung USA warranty support,"I bought this phone in January. Recently that touch screen has completely stopped working, I suspect it was the cause of the random freezes and restarts I had started to see about a month ago too which I though was software related but factory resets didn't help. Samsung USA won't support this phone, they are apparently clueless on it and direct you to its country of origin in my case UAE (can be anywhere... India, Bulgaria, etc.) even though it was still manufactured like all the others in Korea. So after talking to Samsung in UAE they want me to ship it there for any type of warranty support which won't be cheap or fast.I had faith in Samsung but this recent failure of them to be able to support an ""International"" phone internationally has given me second thoughts. The reason I purchased this phone was so I could use it while traveling, which worked great.",2013年8月8日 在美国审核
vs. iPhone,"Siri is the ""assistant"" on iPhone.Siri is better than the assistants (S Voice and Google) on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because Siri is more integrated into the phone and understands commands better.Also, here was a surprise:Note 2 is terrible on searching for names within contacts -- you almost need to be exact for the name to pop up.Still, because of the S Pen and being able to point on items instead of hoping my fingers land just right, and because of the screen size for watching videos, I would get the Note 2 again over the iPhone.However, I am going to upgrade to the Note 3 if some of the downsides have been fixed.",2013年9月1日 在美国审核

Incredible phone with awesome display - but big,"I decided to trade out the Samsung Galaxy S3 that I got last week for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. The S3 was free after rebate - the Note 2 cost me $100. Screen size is amazing - 5.5"" screen vs. 4.8"" for the S3, or 4"" for the iPhone 5. It is definitely a 2-handed phone, which I am still not used to. It is very difficult to unlock my screen with one hand. Just holding it in my hand using it as a phone is quite uncomfortable.The firm wide grip actually causes an ache in your hand.I think this pretty much pushes the limit of how big a phone can be and still usable as a phone. It goes in my front pocket just fine.It's a bit wide but I think I can get used to it.Performance seems to be about the same. Download speed maxes out around 28 Mbps on T-Mobile 4G (HSPA+). The camera is real cool. You can hold down the ""shutter"" button and it will burst as many frames as you want. It has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB internal flash memory storage - lots of space for pictures and video. I don't know if I'm going to get a lot of use out of the stylus, but it does have some cool apps. Battery life is amazing. I was constantly messing with the phone all day, and only used up half the battery.If I can get used to the size of this phone, this is the best phone out there.If not, you might be better off with the Galaxy S3.",2012年11月25日 在美国审核
An awesome phone!,"I actually bought it on amazon europe but I felt like reviewing it on amazon.com too, since more people read the reviews here.So here we go:After being a happy owner of a Galaxy S phone, which was an ok phone for it's time, now I am thrilled with this one.All the problems I had with the Galaxy S are gone.It's fast, it does not lag, it has 2GB of RAM (which is tons of RAM for a phone) and it does the job efficiently without a hitch!No crashes like the Galaxy S, no dropped calls, no force closing apps due to RAM shortage. It works perfectly!The screen size is great and performance of the display is outstanding!I can spend hours on it reading articles, without getting tired. I can use it in the sun to take photographs and the display is still nice and bright.The stylus is really cool too, but rarely use it.And the best one, is the battery life.It lasts me 2-3 days with no recharge with moderate use (provided the powersaving toggle is on)... and of course it's a blazingly fast phone due to it's quad core CPU.It's a treat of a phone!",2013年3月8日 在美国审核

"Low quality controls, blames customers for internal mistakes.","So 2 months ago I buy this awesome phone, then my soft key LED's stop working and the touch screen has a dead spot, so I figure I'll just send it back and they'll fix it.NOPE.I send it to them, it's gone a little over a week, I get it back still broken, and now it has a awesome spot in the battery compartment that's missing paint that Samsung chipped off apparently during disassembly when they were 'providing customer service'.They say its 'BER'. 'Beyond Economical Repair','GROSS ELECTROMECH DAMAGE-ABUSE'.HUH?!?Really?It also says there was a 'pad lifted' inside, I'm guessing they're talking about a solder pad on the board.This all from a new phone that was always in a case and never dropped or 'abused'.My only guess is that it was messed up when it left the factory or during shipping, or during some fool at Samsung prying at the board (they did in fact chip the paint!So I think that's totally possible), then it failed on me, and Samsung blames me for their manufacturing mistakes.I watched the guy at the store open this device new and unpackage it, so it was not them.Wow, great customer service.Just do a Google search ""Samsung bad service"" and you'll see that I'm not the only one.Buyer beware, Samsung refuses to help their customers.Even Apple admits to their manufacturing flaws; dented phones, scratched screens reversed buttons, dead pixels...but Samsung?Nope, you, Mr. Customer, you broke it, and there's no way you can prove otherwise!BER? It should be BPR, Beyond Profitable Repair.This was the first and last time that I will EVER buy a Samsung anything.On top of it all they totally voided my warranty, not like they had any intention of honoring it.I'm also filing complaints with the state attorney generals office and the better business bureau.Apple may have their downfalls with the junk iTunes and limitation of their devices, but I may just go back...",2013年3月21日 在美国审核

I will not recommend this phone,"I had Samsung Note 2 from AT&amp;T for 2 weeks. I used it to make calls, read and reply to emails, browse the web, watch YouTube, and check stock charts. I am not a very heavy gamer, so I did not play many games with it except stuff like Temple Run, Family Feud etc. I did not use SPEN but I can see it being useful for some.I was an iPhone 4s user before Note 2 and went back to an iPhone 5 after I returned the Note 2 to the A&amp;T store.Here are the things I like about this phone-* The excellent and vibrant screen- It's full of life and the colors just come so naturally to it, it's beautiful.Be careful however, you will not be able to see the screen in very bright sunlight. Also, the screen brightness varies between dim and bright even when you are reading a web page or an application. Not a deal breaker, but annoyance nevertheless..* Responsive and fast UI, Operating system. Google has delivered a pretty stable OS (I had 4.2.2 with this device)* Despite the 5.5 inch screen, the battery life is impressive.. It will last me a full day of moderate use and then some. Do know that battery takes about 2.5 hours to charge from about 10% to 100%.Here are the things I dislike-- The navigation seems to be suffering from a worst case of ADD. It just does not ""feel right"". There are just too many things, it seems like they have just thrown together to see what sticks. Too many backs, too many unnecessary swipes left and right, hidden menus. If you prefer simplicity and openness, iPhoneis the best platform.- The build quality is sub-par. It's made of a very cheap, shiny plastic that gets very greasy when you touch it.The screen gets extremely greasy and looks awful after short usage, its unlike iPhone 5's screen that gives you a matte finish looks which looks gorgeous. The battery cover creaks and moans.- Samsung bloatware is too much to bear. Samsung has added so many un-necessary applications and widgets that make me wonder if any one really uses it?I have had iPhone 5 now for a week now and I cant be any happier with my smartphone choice. Its just intuitive,it just works!To summarize- if you are a busy, always on the road professional and want to keep things simple and easy with your cell phone , Note 2 is not your phone.",2013年5月17日 在美国审核
"Good function, but not for the screen","Even though this is one of the best Android mobile phones in the market, with very nice set of functions, and good performance,unfortunately, it has an easily breakable glass screen. Yes, it is a very nice looking, but too fragile for a mobile phone. I have used many phones, and normally it drops off, slips off from time to time, and I never had any a major issue with any phone. My new Galaxy Note 2 was dropped on the floor, from no more than 50cm height, and the screen was totally smashed like a low quality watch face.After a little search for a solution ( phone calls, &amp; online), I was really surprised, when i found that it was a common problem with Galaxy Note, and Galaxy S3, even with a protection case.The company should recognize that customers purchase hardware for the service they get, handheld devices are expected to drop often, so the designers should consider this fact. or at least provide a protection case or a rubber frame for free in the box ( which will cost them less than $1).I gave only two stars, because the value of all nice functions will be of less value if i need to use the device with special extra care,worrying not to break it all the time,or if I need to pay extra for the expensive repair(s), then the price will be too high for these functions.This is like, having an excellent expensive meal, while you have to stand on one leg to eat it.",2013年4月4日 在美国审核

marginal,"device performs much below expectations. The only reason i keep using this phone is because of the larger screen I need which no other phone in the US can offer. Aside from that there is not much to admire about. Instead recurrent problems include,Rotate screen frequently does not work which can be very annoying at times when it is most useful (i.e. during gps driving, the screen failed to rotate many times, which forced me to rotate the car mounter instead).The two window feature also confusing and sometimes does not seem to work.It s got pen but I dont use it anyways.Video and still pics taken by care automatically uploads to google+ without any warning and by default which is a security concern for me. So far I havent found a way to disable it, the setting does not offer to disable this. Not sure if there is a trick around if I research it online.

Must buy for busy people,"This is one hell of a gadget. It is the best product I currently use. The screen is simply beautiful, speed is excellent, and it feels luxurious with the glowing screen and heavy feel. I use it for all sorts of things and it never fails you. Battery is awesome, for the first few days I practically spent all day using it, testing it, downloading apps ...etc. and there's always at least 20-30% battery left at night after 16+ hours of heavy use. I happily spent 600 Euros to buy it, and that was very good value, in fact the price of this phone should not compare to other smart phones out there, as this is a different product, it truly is a phone and a tablet in one (so the alternative is buying 2 items for double the price). I am not a so-called Apple hater, but the iPhone is a toy next to this one(I used the iPhone 5 for 3 days); even the Galaxy S3 is reduced to a toy next to it. Samsung could easily sell it for additional 30% in price (at least to those who appreciate it). One comment about the size: you buy this phone specifically for its size, I wonder how some reviews mention its size as a disadvantage or a con ... how can that be when you bought it BECAUSE of its size not in spite of it? Don't hesitate about it, buy it IF you need a bigger screen. If the size to you is an obstacle then stick to the smaller ones, as this is not intended to be just another phone, it's intended to be a personal assistant, tablet, and phone. I recommend it without hesitation, and would like to thank Samsung for making such a beautiful product.",2012年10月10日 在美国审核

This is why I wait a month to rate a product,"The Droid OS is amazing; I just wish I had gotten it on a more durable phone like the Razr Maxx I replaced this one with. The Note II is made to be dropped--it's seriously like the thing is oiled before it leaves the factory-- and it will crack very very easily, and stop working shortly thereafter. I know this from experience, and I expect better from a $700 piece of technology (I don't want to hear this crap about I should have paid another 30 dollars for a semi-protective case that should already be on the phone when you buy it, I mean, come on it replaces the battery). As someone who has owned everything from the Nokia 3360 (indestructible) to the Iphone 4, this is the most expensive and least durable phone I have ever seen, by far. The stylus and note-taking features were the initial draw for me, but the program for taking notes is setup very poorly, and you can't take notes on a phone that doesn't work. Now I am just sad I wasted my upgrade on this ""phablet""; so much so that I elected to pay 200 for a refurbished Motorola, rather than paying for the Samsung repair. I will be getting a Xyboard for all my note taking, internet surfing needs (which, by the way, is also cheaper than the Note II).Also, Samsung has very bad customer service, and is known for cheapening out on their products. It takes a class action lawsuit (literally) to get them to address their own design flaws.",2013年2月24日 在美国审核
This is a great cellphone!,"Update: 01/02After contacting Samsung on their Facebook page, they did some magic and the side bar is now back?I am happy!You pay big $$$ for a cellphone, you should have a sidebar.Thanks Samsung.[...]Update:12/29I now do not have multitasking and a side baron the left side to pull out.Hmm, wonder when they snuck that in.Works great now.A big five star!!!Update: 12/27My wifi keep going away and I have to log into it.Not sure what is going on.Oh, I brought a case for it and tore out the plastic case and put velcro on the inside of it and the hooks velcro on the back of my cellphone.The plastic case will protect it, in case of falls and the velcro hooks make it easier to hold onto.The when I go somewhere, I just velcro it together, inside the case and carry it that way.An expensive cellphone like the Note II, deserves protection or ouch, buy another one.Update: 12-20Because Samsung screwed me out of multitasking!No sidebar for United States, a vital features, that other Countries are using.It was built for multitasking and Samsung is denying it to Americans.Until they upgrade my Note II so it can multitask, I will only give it a * one star.I suggest other people do this, too.Maybe if their bottom line $$$$ shrinks, they will give it to the world and not just a few!Shame on Samsung.Is this blackmail?No,it's the only tool I have, to get them to play fair with ALL buyers of Note II.Update 12/14;This is stupid.In 'Nearby devices"" 'allow device list', you can select the device, BUT YOU CAN'T SAVE THE LIST!!?You can either 'CANCEL' or ""DELETE', items in the list.You can select, but no way of saving them.Da!Why have a 'Device' list if you can't save it?Samsung??The best thing I love about it, it talks to my Samsung LED tv!With AllShare, I can look at pictures I took with Note II andI can load YouTube on the Note II and it comes up on my tv. The two talk to each other.Also, Facebook is missing if you want to take a picture and send it to your Facebook account.Samsung?!!!I email mine and then transfer it over to my Facebook account.I've had mine for a couple of days.GOt it from aTT@$299+2yr contract&lt;$100 per monthThe camera is better than many DSLR's or point and shoot camera.Close ups, distance, low light, this does them all.And with Android play store, you have countless photo apps to adjust your picture + share.I use Allshare to view the pic's on my Samsung tv, works fine. Easy to send to Facebook or email.THis is a well thought out cellphone.The only thing I don't like about it, is the location of the on/off button.I keep hitting it with my finger.If you are going to get it, just as well go the ATT route and save a few hundred bucks. $299!Ask them to give you free activation and they will do it.Great customer service, they will help with anything.Ask about their 300 minute plan, if you force them to tell you and free data!Oh, the cellphone.It has a cellphone, too!More on that later....Merry X-mas!Don't try to cancel, if with ATT.They keep leading you around in circles, from one person to the next, to wear you down and give up.You think you have got the right one, no, you only got a fluffier, one who fluffs you up, to tryto change your mind.The only way is to send the phone back; within fourteen days, for a cancellation.But, this cellphone is so perfect, so great, so everything, you won't want to give it up.It is that great.If not, bill me.",2012年12月11日 在美国审核

Front glass EXTREMELY fragile!,"The Note II is a fantastic phone, hands down. Sadly, though, it has one severe fatal flaw: the front glass is tremendously fragile.I purchased my Note II during the 2012 holidays. A few weeks ago, I dropped it and the front glass completely shattered. Having never broken a phone after dropping it, I was surprised and disappointed--I've dropped previous phones before from higher heights than 2.5 feet and they survived unscathed. I chalked it up to bad luck, and Asurion sent me a new one after I paid my deductible.Yesterday, I dropped my replacement, again, from a height of roughly two feet. Again, the front glass completely shattered.Once, okay, I can grudgingly deal with that. But -twice?- Inside two weeks? That's no longer a coincidence. That's a design defect. The front glass needs to be made a lot more robust.Since I only have one more insurance claim left, I've got a decision to make--replace the phone or replace the front glass myself. Both choices are equally daunting; YouTube is rife with videos on how to replace the front glass of the Note II and the Galaxy S III.Whatever the outcome, though, the phone is definitely going into an OtterBox afterward.",2013年2月7日 在美国审核

Great phablet...Depending on your carrier.,I dont know if I made a mistake or not-however when I saw the Note 2-I was in a Tmobile store waiting on a friend to pay a bill. I was instantly attracted. So attracted I cancelled my Verizon account RIGHT there and made the swap to TMobile. Why not right? Its in the top 3. Big mistake.In a different scenario-the Phone is like a Corvette while the Tmobile service is like an old man driving the Corvette. Does not and will not take the Corvette to its full potential.It is my opinion that this phone is TOO much for Tmobile and Tmobile does not have the resources to back such a powerful device. Yes it IS that powerful. Out in the open city-she works just fine. As soon as you get a hint of cover-there goes the service which kills the phone.So is this review about the phone? Kinda. If you want to get the Note 2-get it with a carrier than can actually support it or be stuck with Cricket like service with a flashed Droid.Tmobile states they plan to acquire more towers by next year-I am hoping and waiting for it patiently as I stay away from covers and concrete.,2012年11月14日 在美国审核

Beware of screen cracks/drops and repair costs,"This was my first purchase of android. After purchasing Apple TV, iphone 3gs, and ipad 3 on the launch day, this screen size of 5.5"" became too irresistible. This phone had the biggest size screen I can carry everywhere.My happiness lasted only one week. I accidentally dropped it from nearly 2 feet height, and glass screen got cracked from top level corner side. All good reviews about strength of CORNING® GORILLA® GLASS, and good drop tests became meaningless to me, as it couldn't survive my first drop, while iphone 3gs survived multiple such drops or worse (from up to 4 feet) without any issue. I may be unlucky that the impact point was corner, but others need to be beware of this fact that 2 feet drop is sufficient to crack the glass if the ground hits the corner of phone.Biggest reason of my low ranking is its repair cost. Samsung support service were sympathetic, but did not budge on waiver or reduction of cost (~$191), even if only glass has cracked, while touch screen, display etc were working fine. Glass can be purchased separately for only around $30, but changing glass will make my warranty void. Samsung replaces glass with full lcd Screen + Touch Digitizer Assembly and that increases the cost, and you can forget about some positive surprises like iphone support, where sometimes they replace phone with screen cracks free of cost.Other negatives/issues I found, which you should consider before buying- Camera quality is not so good , especially the foucs/image stabilization. My 8 mp, 5 year old normal point and shoot canon camera(sd 870) can shoot much better and crisp photo than this both in low indoor light or full outside daylight. So for any trip, I will need to carry both camera, and phone. This phone can't replace that point and shoot camera.- I definitely miss the easy to use apple's airplay feature.May be I will need to purchase google tv, but thats additional cost, and not sure how good that will work.- There is no way to disable 4g LTE /3gs feature. Iphone 3gs had that nice feature to disable 3g, which is very useful, in a road trip, where I just need to search for some store hours/address or location, and I don't want fast 3gs/4g lte to accidentally do some background tasks and go over my data limit of 200 MB within 4-5 minutes.- Touch screen seems not as responsive as iphone. Sometimes I need to pressrefresh/done etc button of browser 4-5 times before that touch is registered.Positives of phone are already covered in many other reviews, so I won't repeat them to keep this review focused on the drawbacks of phone/support service, so that readers can take an informed decision about purchasing this phone.",2012年12月3日 在美国审核

Amazing phone - but where's the MEMORY?,"I got this on a carrier for the two week ""trial"" and I'm going to return it. I work with film (digital), and 3D modeling applications. The OS is amazing, the phone/phablet is NEARLY flawless, and I love it's cutting edge performance. I want this beauty so badly but a 16GB internal memory isn't going to cut it for me. This phone/phablet is meant to replace a laptop, camera, sketchbook and WAS going to be my mobile workstation. With all that capability you'd think they'd release this phone with a 32GB and 64GB option at the same time on all the carriers. I've scoured the internet and no one at the stores can give me a straight answer about the memory options and if/when they'll be available. It's so frustrating to finally find the phone/phablet that's practically perfect in nearly every way - except skimpy on memory for it's abilities. If I'm going to have it for two years the minimum I'd buy is a 32GB model. C'mon where are the bigger memory options for this thing? They are keeping people like me from committing! While I realize you can buy a memory card (I'll be getting one too) my issue is that if I'm going to use it for two years on contract I don't want to have to pick and choose what to load on the phone or worry about storing more on the card than phablet/phone itself especially since I intend to wear out all those useful features. I want to show people what I'm working on now and on projects I've done in the past - or show them my 3D models. That all takes up memory and instead of waiting on an iffy connection it makes sense to have what you need with you period. I say go big or go home and I want a to use this beauty to it's full potential and test the limits to see just how much it can really handle.That being said I have to ask why they won't release the other memory option models with such an amazing OS and phablet/phone. I think it's time we all pester Samsung about this. If they can release this overseas with all the memory options why won't they do that here in the US with such a massive market? The iPhone 5 has all three available, the S III launched the same as have many others so why the rub on this beast of a phablet/phone? Another thing to think about is what if they are holding out for the annoying Black Friday or Cyber Monday? I don't want to commit only to find out I could've gotten the model I REALLY wanted if I had waited two more weeks or a month. That's happened to me before so I'd like to not have to deal with it again. Has anyone else experienced that frustration? ""If only I'd waited another two weeks!""That being said my ONLY complaint (I'm talking to you Samsung)is that for such a gorgeous beast of a tool you don't seem too concerned about not offering the 32GB and 64GB options for this market. Don't keep people like me waiting too long or I'll go elsewhere - to a competitor.",2012年11月8日 在美国审核

I wonder who's lying here...,"Samsung corporate told me on chat that they do not make a factory unlocked, non-carrier version of the phone. Odd, since it seems to be right here, and there's over 30 5 star reviews. Then again, salesmen know people look for that when they consider buying. I wonder how hard it would be for salesmen to get online and write a ton of great 5 star reviews that sound really genuine and believable.Here's another question. Why is it out of all these reviews, nobody seemed surprised to get a carrier version? Odd that--since several Samsung techs were VERY clear to me that THEY ONLY MAKE CARRIER VERSIONS, and these must be purchased through the carriers.I wonder who's lying here. Since I sold cell phones for over half a decade, I can tell you first hand that aside from the very basic, immediately verifiable facts, you can't believe a word they say.

Ich möchte das Samsung Note2 nicht mehr hergeben,"Nach vielen Jahren Iphone habe ich mich wegen der geringen SAR-Werte für das Note2 entschieden und bin sehr zufrieden. Auch die Größe, vor welcher ich zunächst für den täglichen Gebrauch ""Respekt"" hatte, erweist sich als absoluten Zugewinn. Es ersetzt oft das Tablet oder den Laptop beim surfen im Internet. Und auch beim Telefonieren habe ich mich schnell an die Größe gewöhnt.Von der Menüführung muss man sich als ehemaliger IOS-Besitzer ziemlich umstellen, aber mittlerweile ist alles in Fleisch und Blut übergegange . Camera ist ok. Hier seh ich ähnliche Defizite beim fotografieren von bewegten Bildern wie beim Iphone. Sie sind nicht wirklich scharf.

Verkäufer top-Gerät top,"Habe schon das Note 1 seit 2,5 Jahren in Besitz und bin bis auf einzelne Farbabsprengungen im Bereich des Ladeanschlusses und des Kopfhörers sehr zufrieden mit dem Gerät. Nach 1,5 Jahren war ein Akkuwechsel fällig - kaputt von einem Moment zum nächsten. War aber ja kein Problem, da man über den Steckrücken ja ohne Service rankommt. Nun hat meine Freundin das Note 2 und es ist mindestens nochmal eine Klasse besser. (Achtung: Kleine Simkarte) Völlig ruckelfrei - alles geht viel schneller. Auch die Bilder scheinen nochmal besser zu sein. Toll, wie innerhalb so kurzer Zeit die Entwicklung weitergegangen ist. Das Note 3 war uns noch zu teuer - ist aber sicher nochmal ein Quantensprung. Das liebste Handy wäre uns aus qualitativen Gründen (wasserdicht/wertiges Gehäuse/eben ""SonyQualität"") das Sony Z1 gewesen - nur mit 5 Zoll fast schon zu klein, wenn man viel im Internet ist und ohne den wichtigen Stick, der das Tippen so erleichtert.Mit dem Samsung Note 2 kann man -wie ich finde- zu den momentan sehr günstigen Preisen sehr gut leben - muß nur eben auf die Feuchtigkeit aufpassen, da eben im Unterschied zum Sony nicht wasserdicht. Dafür ist dann der Akkuwechsel einfach und man hat den einschiebbaren Stick- alles hat eben (wie immer) zwei Seiten",2014年1月18日 在德国审核
Note for Note,"Ich find's klasse. Jetzt hab ich endlich ein Smartphone, auf dem selbst ich noch was erkennen kann. Im Gegensatz zu meinem Samsung Galaxy S plus, das ich vorher hatte (mit dem ich übrigens auch sehr zufrieden war), ist doch alles etwas lesbarer und ich benötige nicht mehr zwingend für alles eine Lesebrille. Größe ist eben doch alles (für Blindfische und Grottenolme).Die S-Pen-Funktionen sind absolut der Knaller. Das Ding erkennt sogar recht zuverlässig meine Sauklaue. Auf diese Weise spare ich natürlich gute Zeit, wenn ich etwas schreibe. Ebenfalls toll ist der Fotoblitz (den ich allerdings mehr als Taschenlampe, als für den eigentlichen Zweck nutze). Aber auch die Kamera macht wirklich gute Bilder (sie scheint manchmal zu ahnen, was ich eigentlich hätte aufnehmen wollen. Irgendwie sehen die Bilder am Ende immer besser aus, als ich es erwartet hätte).Das Betriebssystem ist, für Umsteiger vom ""Gingerbread"" (Android 2.3) auf das hier integrierte ""Jelly Bean"" (Android 4.1), an manchen Stellen gewöhnungsbedürftig. Bei den ersten Handgriffe damit habe ich mich gleich vertippt. Der von mir links erwartete ""OK""-Button ist auf einmal rechts. Also hab ich die ersten Male meine Einstellung eher abgebrochen, als bestätigt. Auch manche Apps scheinen auf ""Jelly Bean""-Basis etwas anders zu funktionieren. Es ist recht häufig, dass sie ""Speichern""- und ""Abbruch""-Option in den Apps häufig oben statt unten (wo sie m.E. nach sein sollten) zu finden sind. Aber auch daran gewöhnt man sich.Jedenfalls bin ich (als iPhone-Gegner) sehr zufrieden mit dem Open-Source-Betriebssystem von Android. Und wenn das ganze noch auf einem so zuverlässig arbeitenden Gerät läuft, wie dem Samsung Galaxy Note 2, dann ist das für mich das Gerät der Wahl.Nur einen Minuspunkt gibt es: Man braucht auf jeden Fall irgend ein extra Case für dieses Smartphone. Denn nach meinem Eindruck ist z.B. die rückwärtige Verschalung deutlich labberiger, als die meines vorher genutzten Galaxy S plus. Außerdem hätte ich Angst, dass mir das ""Tele-Pad"" aus der Hand rutschen würde, wenn ich kein Case drum hätte. Nur damit ist die Dünne des Geräts wieder kompensiert. Es ist halt ein Riesen-Klopper im Vergleich zu anderen Smartphones. Oder sollte ich besser sagen, es ist ein schöne kleines Tablet, das auch noch in große Hemds-, Hosen- oder Jackentaschen passt? Auch durch das jetzige 16:9-Format passt es dann doch, da es, im Vergleich zum Vorgänger-Modell, doch noch etwas schmaler geworden ist.Ich ziehe, trotz des einen oder anderen kleinen Negativ-Punktes, keinen Stern ab. Schließlich muss ich meine Erwartungen an das Gerät als Ausgangspunkt für meine Bewertung nehmen. Und die sind alle übererfüllt.

Note 1 für Galaxy Note 2,"Bin vor kurzem umgestiegen vom SGS+ auf das Note 2. Der Unterschied ist gigantisch, nicht nur vom Format her.Display: Richtig groß und gestochen scharf. Da macht Surfen und Videos Ansehen mächtig Spaß. Auch das Editieren oder Lesen von Emails ist selbst mit schwächeren Augen kein Problem mehr.Audio: Super Sound über Kopfhörer oder Stereoanlage (entsprechende Qualität der Geräte vorausgesetzt). Selbst der Lautsprecher am Note 2 hat einen verglichen mit anderen Smartphones sehr guten Klang und erreicht eine beeindruckende und raumfüllende Lautstärke. Für mich kaufentscheidend war auch das eingebaute UKW-Radio, was bei neueren Geräten häufig gar nicht mehr vorhanden ist. Das Radio hat übrigens einen hervorragenden Empfang.Alle Komponenten am Gerät arbeiten so, wie es sein soll. Es gibt keinerlei Probleme im Betrieb, egal ob beim Telefonieren, Surfen, Verbindungsaufbau über BT oder WLAN oder was auch immer. Das Betriebssystem (Android 4.4.2) läuft sehr stabil und dank hochwertigem Quadcore und ausreichend Speicher laufen alle Apps flüssig und störungsfrei. Der riesige Akku mit über 3Ah soll als Sahnehäubchen nicht unerwähnt bleiben.Kinderleicht funktioniert auch der Datenaustausch mit dem PC einschließlich Syncen von Kalender und Kontakten. Das Note 2 wird unter Windows als zusätzliches Laufwerk dargestellt und Dateien können ganz einfach per Drag &amp; Drop verschoben oder kopiert werden.Der einzige Nachteil des Note 2 ist, wenn man so will, wohl seine Größe, was die Einhandbedienung nicht immer einfach macht und das Verstauen des Gerätes in Hosen- und Hemdtaschen arg einschränkt.Fazit:Meine Erwartungshaltung an das Gerät war eher gedämpft, da ich des öfteren schon die Erfahrung machen mußte, dass Werbeversprechen in der Realität nichts wert sind. Doch das Note 2 ist in allen Belangen deutlich besser als mein altes SGS+ und hat mich vollends begeistert - optisch, technisch und von der Bedienung her -und läßt bei mir womöglich auf Jahre hinaus keine Smartphone-Wünsche offen.",2014年9月24日 在德国审核

etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig,"Hallo,Ich habe mir das Smartphone mitte Januar 2013 bestellt und habe es seither in Benutzung.Verarbeitung: Im großen und ganzen handelt es sich hier um eine sehr kompakte &amp; robuste Verarbeitung. Obwohl bei diesem Gerät hauptsächlich polycarbonat zum einsatz kommt fühlt es sich nicht minderwertig an, sondern hat sogar, obwohl es recht groß im Vergleich zu anderen Geräten ist ein angenhmes Gewicht. Einzig und allein bei der laut-leiser ""Wippe"" gibt es ein wenig ""Spiel"", obgleich der Druckpunkt bei allen Knöpfen in meinen Augen angenehm ist. Es ist stabiler als es zunächst den Anschein hat, denn mir ist es schon häufiger aus Hüfthöhe auf harten Boden gefallen ohne ernsthafte schäden am Display davongetragen zu haben, lediglich der verchromte Rahmen ist anfällig für Lackschäden durch Kratzer und Stürze. Das Backcover ist meiner Meinung nach der Schwachpunkt in der Verarbeitung, da es durch die recht glatte oberfläche kaum halt bietet, was aber gerade wenn man das Gerät mit einer Hand bedienen möchte wichtig wäre, abhilfe schafft hier die Möglichkeit es durch eines mir rauerer Oberflächeauszutauschen. Nun zum eigentlichen Herzstück des Note 2, dem S-Pen: Auch er ist gut verarbeitet. Man kann ihn bequem rein und rausziehen. Hierbei ist es wichtig, dass der Stift trotz häufigem rein und rausziehen zuminest bei mir noch sehr Stabil einrastet.Bedienung: Wie die meisten Samsung Geräte verfügt das Galaxy Note 2 über die Hauseigene Android Variante mit Touchwiz, das ist für das Note 2 in erster Linie Gut, da diese Version auf die Funktionalitäten des S- Pens abgestimmt ist und Android wirklich sehr flüssig läuft. An dieser Stelle muss man sich jedoch vor dem Kauf entscheiden, ob man den Stift wirklich braucht. Ich nutze ihn z.B. sehr gerne zum schreiben, da ich nicht so gerne auf der virtuellen Tastatur Tippe. Nach ein bisschen Eingewöhnung funktioniert die Schrifterkennung auch sehr gut und es fällt leicht auch längere Texte so zu schreiben. Ein bisschen malen geht auch, ist in meinen Augen aber eher spielerei. Die Größe empfand ichanfangs als etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, gerade z.B. einhändig im Bus erweist sich die Bedienung als Problematisch, es gibt aber glücklicherweise einstellungsmöglichkeiten für die einhändige Bedienung, die zumindest ein wenig abhilfe schaffen. Gleichzeitig ist die Größe auch eine größe Stärke des Note 2 z.B. Surfen oder Videos gucken ist deutlich angenehmer als auf einem kleinen Display.Allerdingsist die Updatepolitik von Samsung nicht gerade das gelbe vom Ei, denn gerade bei der Note Serie ist man, aufgrund des S-Pens, ein Stück weit auf Samsung angewiesen was die Updates betrifft. Trotzdem wird man nur recht spät mit Android Updates versorgt.Insgesamt handelt es sich hierbei aber um ein Tolles Gerät, bei dem man vorallem die ungewöhnliche Größe und den Nutzen des S - Pen für sich in die Kaufentscheidung miteinbeziehen sollte. Von mir gibt es wegen der anfangs etwas gewöhnungsbedürftigen Bedienung und der unzureichenden Updateversorgung 4/5 Punkten, also klare Kaufempfehlung!!!",2013年12月29日 在德国审核
