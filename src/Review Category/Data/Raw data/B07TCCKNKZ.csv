Pay close attention - not quite as described!!!,"i received the phone today, well packaged (NOT in it's original box, but the packaging was appropriate). Upon opening the package and inspection, I was pleasantly surprised to see the original charger and earbuds included... However, i was disappointed to find that the fingerprint scanner was seriously chipped in 2 places by something sharp (see pictures), which made it unusable. I don't think it was worth the price paid, given the fingerprint sensor is broken... but I chose to keep it, i will be using a complex unlock password. And, for ""the good news"", this phone was actually unlocked and i was able to register it on the T-Mo network with zero issues . I seriously question how this phone was ""certified"", though. Again, i don't think it was worth the price paid... but i needed a decent phone, and this one does the job. Buyers out there... BEWARE, and use Amazon's free return shipping if needed - they're awesome.",2019年3月30日 在美国审核

Was Really Spooked at First.. But it is perfect!,"*Just as a note.. I will update the longer I own this device* Anyways, When I ordered this phone I was so excited because I was moving up from an iPhone 7. It was only after buying this phone the I started seeing the 1 star reviews that stated they received a unit that was either malfunctioning or was locked due to a previous balance from original owner. So I started to get really anxious and scared because I thought I spent the money on a messed up phone, however when I reviewed over the reviews again I noticed that those reviews were made in 2018 and the most recent one's were all positive. And sure enough, I received the phone and it look absolutely flawless and in fantastic working order! So far everything is working perfectly and I could not be happier. Like I said I will update the longer I own the phone.",2019年7月5日 在美国审核

Phone continually malfunctions due to incorrect refurbishing practices,"Despite adjusting the screen display setting, the phone keeps dimming every 5 seconds and there are some other glitchy things it does.The company sent me a second phone and it does the same thing.The Verizon tech could not solve the issue and referred me to a Samsung tech who determined that the seller is not doing their refurbishing under Samsung's protocol.They couldn't even get the phone to accept the security updates.I use my phone 100% of the time for work and this has been a major inconvenience and more stress than I could imagine.I would not buy from them again.They have to know their product is crap.The stupid screen won't even stay on unless it's an active app or video.How could it possibly pass an inspection?I gave them a chance to send me a phone that actually worked and they didn't even check the second phone before sending it to make sure I wouldn't be dealing with the same issue again.That's not service.",2018年12月17日 在美国审核

Very happy with the phone but be careful... (TL;DR: Phone wasn't completely unlocked but I got lucky),"Phone works great! Got mine from ElectronicDeals. No cracks, scratches, software issues whatsoever. I was honestly really hesitant to buy a refurbished phone but I ended up taking the risk and was not mostly not disappointed.I only had one problem with the phone as a whole: The ""unlocked"" part:When I got the phone I was using MetroPCS but the phone was only half unlocked by Sprint. I was still able to get it activated under Metro and use their service, but signal felt iffy and there was a constant, annoying Sprint OMADM notification in my notification bar. It was out of Metro's hands so I took it to a local Sprint store. They said the only thing they could do was put in a request to get it fully unlocked. They got my number and phone information and I left. Unsatisfied, I decided to try another local Sprint store in the city. The guy at this store said the same thing but he helped me out a bit more. He explained that switching to Sprint would more than likely get rid of notification and improve the service connection. Naturally I was a bit weary about the offer due to being with MetroPCS for long without any problems and he may just be telling me this to make a sale. My worry quickly faded when he told me I would only be paying $25 a month with unlimited everything and I can leave anytime with no strings attached. Like buying the phone in the first place I was hesitant, but ultimately decided to give it a shot. He was right in telling me it would take away the annoying notification and my service is better than ever.Overall, while it all worked out me me in the end, you may want to try to contact the seller before buying just to make sure the phone is 100% unlocked. And if it's not, try to get as much information as possible about so you can unlocked it yourself or at the very least match it up with your current service provider.",2018年9月14日 在美国审核

A great deal for what's in essence a new phone...,"So far this has been an excellent purchase. Cosmetically, I'm not sure if my device was just a return or overstock item, but it came with a lot of its original plastic sticker coverings (see pictures) and basically DOES look indistinguishable from a new S9+. The phone came in a generic box, but it did come with its OEM charger and cable.<br>Mechanically, everything is sound. The display is perfect, it looks amazing, and all cameras, speakers, charging ports, etc. all function and perform just like a new phone (I had an S9+ a few months back I bought new so I have some knowledge with that). The only flaw I found was some light micro scratches on the back of the phone that are really impossible to see and also an eventuality with any glass back phone.Buying a refurbished phone can definitely feel risky at times, but I've used the phone for a couple days now and haven't run into any issues that would raise concern, and even if I did Amazon backs the purchase pretty extensively and up to 90 days. That's three whole months in case if you're wondering. I will definitely keep an eye on the phone and update this review if need be, but if you're on the fence don't be. Just make sure you do your research, buy from a seller that has a great feedback record (itreplay was my seller), and you should be good to go.</br>",2019年2月22日 在美国审核

I simply removed simcard from old phone, inserted it into this one, no issues.

It does not come with a SIM but you can easily use the one from your prior phone and if new line then have the provider send you one or go to VZ corporate store. The only thing is while I like larger screen by the time you put it in a case it becomes heavier.

The phone itself looked brand new after I removed the plastic.Not a mark on it.I installed a Verizonsim and a micro SD and turned the phone on.After going through the basic setup Icontacted Straight Talk to change my serviceover to the new phone. It took a littlebit for this phone to accept calls, but that was a glitch with my carrier. The only negativeso far is this phone came with apps preinstalledthat Ididn't want (candy crush, yelp, and other nonsense).

There's a simple trick to this. My phone is working great.,I should've heeded the reviews that i read. This phone is not unlocked at all.<br>Updated: So the trick to getting this device to work is you have to call your network provider and tell them you're switching your phone but keeping the same sim card. Now they'll ask for the IMEI number of the new device you're switching to which is this and in order to get it just type in *#06# and the info will pop up. Just call from your old device that your sim card is in and you're good to go. Thank me later.</br>,2019年10月10日 在美国审核
Great value!,"I had a Galaxy S7 that was all cracked up, but still worked. AT&amp;T would have charged me $150 for an insurance claim and the phone was several year old already to get a new outdated phone. So for another $50 this S9+ seemed like a good deal / upgrade. I also liked the fact that it's fully unlocked so if I ever decide to leave AT&amp;T I can take it to another carrier. It was easy to move my service over to it at a local AT&amp;T store with no issues. The phone has great battery life. I don't use it a whole lot, but I can go 4 days between charges, whereas the S7 didn't last a single day with light to no use and would shut off. Sometimes the fingerprint scanner is wonky and I just need to clean it off, otherwise it makes me enter a pin which is no big deal. I've had no issues with apps crashing or anything bad to say about the phone. I did purchase a curved glass screen protector and an Otterbox Defender as well to keep it from scratches / cracks and they've been great and the Otterbox doesn't hinder the use of the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone.

Pretty pleased so far,"The phone arrived yesterday, so I haven't had a lot of time with it.I chose the seller I did (CertifiedDevices) based on reviews.The phone arrived well packaged, in a plain white box, with charger and the little pin-thing for opening the SIM card slot.The phone does have a couple tiny nicks on it, on the bottom bezel.They are covered by my phone case and I do not mind them.The screen seems to be in excellent condition.This does use the C-adapter for charging, and I had none of those, other than the one that came in the box (not a complaint, just an observation for anyone going from a phone using the micro-USB port charger).In 12 hours the battery has gone from 100% charge to 59% charge while off the charger, which seems pretty decent to me.Your results may vary based on how you use the phone.Phone did not have a SIM card with it, I did not expect one as those are phone-service-provider specific.Most cell phone companies will provide one free or for a few bucks.I use Verizon; I removed the SIM card from my old phone and inserted it in the new phone, and turned it on and has been working fine in this first 24 hours.After putting the SIM card in and turning on the phone, it verbally walked me through some simple steps, automatically, and voilà, this is now my working phone.Many standard apps updated automatically, and I chose some apps to install right away.After a few hours, the phone wanted to do some operating system updates; I think it went through two iterations of updating the phone.After this, I used the Samsung Smart Switch app to transfer/copy apps from my old S7 to my new S9+.I chose which apps I wanted copied.Turns out Samsung Smart Switch does not also copy over the credentials, so I still had to open the apps to set up my access.Messages, photos, etc., were copied over.It seems just about all the apps have their own notification settings, and most default to making noise!So far I am very happy with the seller and the phone they sold me.Some of my comments have no bearing on the seller or the condition of the phone, but just the experience I've had with the Samsung S9+, in case they're of help to anyone.",2019年8月31日 在美国审核

WORTH IT!,"This Galaxy S9+ is gorgeous. I was very hesitant to buy a refurb phone. I gave it a shot because I wanted an upgrade but paying retail prices seems insane these days. Also, there are so many negative reviews but I am here to write a great one! I'm not one of those people who needs a new phone whenever they release one; I got this because I was annoyed that my old phone was laggy for months (and I'd never get an iPhone so this seemed like the best choice out there). So far, I am very pleased! I am an ATT user and some reviews were saying the phone was incompatible with their SIM- no issues here. Startup and info transfer were simple with smartransfer app. Also read in some reviews that the phone was marked by a different carrier, but mine is not. In tiny writing on the back, it does say it was refurbished by Assurion.All of the nuances I'm unsure of because this is a new phone seem to be explained when you tap on any icon the first time you open it. This phone is very customizable if you want it to be. Camera is awesome, screen display is so clear... not a pixel to be seen. I am still downloading apps but so far, everything is smooth and processor seems snappy.I fully inspected this phone when I unwrapped it because of the bad reviews I read, and I will say there is one teeny, tiny scratch on the back which I could not care less about because you barely notice it and I'm putting a case on anyway. If a small scratch is the price I have to pay for an amazing, basically new, half price phone... I'll take two. Buy the phone!",2019年3月13日 在美国审核
"Ordered a T-mobile branded phone through Hybrid IT and got a nonbranded, factory unlocked SM-G965U1","Device looks brand new, not a single scuff scratch or mark that I can find. No T-Mobile bloatware or apps were installed, just the usual Samsung stuff I'm used to seeing on my previous Galaxy S phones. Works just fine with my carrier, and according to the model number I received, I should be factory unlocked and have no issues switching to any GSM or CDMA carrier. Its a big step up from the S4 I last used. So far, battery life seems less stellar than expected, but that's always a possibility when buying used. I can always install a fresh battery fairly easily. The only negative I can come up with is that the phone was shipped with a generic slow charger. I have Quickcharge 3.0 outlets, as well as the QC3.0 fast charger wall plug from my last phone, so its not a big problem for me.

The phone I received looks brand new. Not a single blemish, scratch, or dent. The phone works flawlessly and the battery life is amazing (as you'd hope for a new phone). The box came with the phone and an Amazon Basics fast charger and cable. I felt this was adequate for a Renewed/Refurbished phone. The phone wasn't branded on the outside with any other carriers logo, nor when I turned it on does it have any carrier information. This was the best purchase decision I've made in a long time, and I'm thrilled with the phone.",2019年5月13日 在美国审核
So Far So Good - Pleasantly Surprised,"I have just upgraded to this S9+ from an S7e. The difference is day and night. The seller shipped this phone in near mint condition: I literally cannot tell it's been renewed. There are zero cosmetic scars and the software seems to work well. I am currently updating the phone which hopefully will solve my only issue: 1-2 signal bars and LTE+ internet vs my usual 4G LTE. I am an AT&amp;T user in the USA. Making the new phone functional was just switching over the SIM card and boom I was able to use the phone. The box the phone came in came with x1 C-Type Charging Cable, x1 Metal Pin for SIM removal, x1 USB/C-Type data transfer trinket, and x1 USB wall adapter. I was weary buying a used phone because I have always gotten them new from AT&amp;T. I am pleasantly surprised at the quality and care this company took in providing me with a new (to me) smartphone. From now on I will be recommending this particular seller to friends/family looking for a new smartphone. Lastly I just want to put this on here that the phone is completely unlocked with no ties to any mobile provider like AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.The following is PROBABLY not the seller's fault but this package arrived with ZERO transit protection. Think of those plastic bags full of air or packing peanuts to protect the products from damage while in transit. For some reason Amazon decided to just ship the phone and various phone related trinkets without any transit protection. To add insult to injury I once ordered as 12 pack of microfiber cleaning cloths that came with plastic bags filled with air. You'd think they'd take extra care of a smartphone better than cleaning cloths but hey that's Amazon for you. From what I can tell the contents of the box are undamaged but it still feels like a slap in the face.",2019年8月14日 在美国审核
You might need to replace the battery.,"So, Where do we start. Well depending on the phone you'll receive. You might get one with some heavy scratches or you might not, But for me I like it. I was going to get the S10 but I went with the S9+ instead. So I got the Phone. And yes it was in rough condition. I called a place here in MI a Phone repair place. Long story short I was able to do what they could do at a decent price. YouTube is a wonderful place isn't it, Took it apart and the screen it now flawless. Other then the ear pice. Don't expect know what's going on there. But I happen to like the Phone. Man it feels great. Heave a little? Yeah, but I can't say that your Phone will be in the same condition as mine. Remember (Renewd ) basically means the same thing as Refurbished.",2022年5月17日 在美国审核
Not many people leave positive reviews after receiving so here's mine,"I don't know if I just got lucky that I received a completely almost new phone, plus it's UNLOCKED. For those people that are showing screenshots of the previous carrier apps, it doesn't mean that it's not unlocked. just ignore the apps. my s9+ has At&amp;t apps that I couldn't remove, but when I put in my Sim card it works perfectly fine, it's not like something was restricting me from using the phone's functions. There was very very small minor scratch on the phone's screen that can only be seen if put under a bright light and if you look very closely. The screen works fine, the back is flawless, no scratch, the whole product is CLEAN. Battery life is awesome. So for the people that are contemplating to get it or not, I say try it. It's backed by amazon, you can return it. Just give it a go and if anything, they send a bad product simply return and get a refund, save a little more for a reasonable priced renewed phone or go for the full price. Bought the s9+ for $369 (renewed), brand new s9+ retails for $500-$650+, I'm adding this because I also purchased a Galaxy Note9 from another seller and only got it for 440$ (renewed) and the brand new retail price is $1000, and it wasn't as good as this s9+ that I received because it had dusts and dirt even the inside where the S-pen inserts in. I had to clean it before I got happy enough to keep it. basically you get what you pay for! so either pay for a steal price but don't expect a brand new looking phone out from the box unless like what I did I had to clean it thoroughly and it was close to looking brand new, or invest a little more and you'll get close to buying a new phone without the work. Read the description, renewed phones rarely comes with original chargers, box, any instructions or phone booklet and no original earphones unless mentioned. Goodluck!",2019年9月7日 在美国审核
Was nervous to purchase but love it!,"I've actually had this in my cart for months, but was nervous to spend the money without actually seeing it or holding it, especially after seeing a few of the reviews and the problems people have had. Finally just went ahead and did it, and I love it. The phone is flawless. The screen is great, battery lasts long and charges quickly. It came with a charging cord (which is too short for my preference, but would work well in a car or for traveling), 2 adapters, and a set of in-ear headphones. The headphones were unexpected, but appreciated, especially since I can NEVER find a pair that actually stay in my ear without falling out and these work amazing. I was actually almost more excited about that than the phone. The set up of the phone was a breeze, I was able to just switch my old SIM card and SD cards over, and everything was done in about 15 minutes at my kitchen counter and without having to visit a store. My only issue was that it was stuck on 3G, and would even go down to 1x when connected to Wi-fi, but after a quick Google search, I just had to change a preference in my settings menu that took me all of 10 seconds and it immediately switched to 4G. I would absolutely purchase this again, and I'm kicking myself that I waited as long as I did.",2020年2月9日 在美国审核
"Cheaters, correction","Update: After doing research and phone calling Samsung confirmed my phone is an S9+ and not an S8+. Consumer Cellular information was wrong. I have to apologize to this business for the false information I entered earlier. CC and I are going to have a talk. I bought this phone a year ago and recently found out it is NOT an S9+ but is an S8+. They are so far refusing to correct their ""mistake"". Anyone who bought this phone needs to contacttheir cell phone carrier and have them check to see if you really got what was sold to you. For an S8+ it worked great but now I have to buy a new phone as my carrier is no longer supporting 3G (I thought I had a 4G).",2021年9月26日 在美国审核
BEST PHONE EVER,"As most people will tell you, Samsung makes a great phone. I've been using Samsung since S5. I love all the features about it,especially the edge. I love that it's waterproof. But, you said to tell you what I don't like about it. And that is the gruesome Bixby. I feel like many people; Samsung, LG and other companies are installing features that we do not want. They also make it almost impossible to get rid of. Virtually most of these preinstalled features are preset and cannot be in uninstalled. Many people are paying a lot for the phone. So in order to have as much storage on the device that they would want for the things they prefer, they have to compensate . They would have to spend extra money and buy an SD card for extra storage. To me this is not fair. I think what they should have done which mad more sense to me, was left this as an option for people to install . Enough said. I do love the phone..",2020年5月29日 在美国审核
Works on Verizon Networks.,Wow! What a great phone. It looks and performs like new. A beautiful screen with a pre-installed screen protector. I popped in my sim card that I used in a prior Galaxy S8+ and it worked with minimal to no issues. The phone updated to the latest Android OS 10 as well as other security updates. This phone is amazing. It will take me some time to configure it for optimal performance to my taste but the process is fun and sometimes exhausting. This is a great purchase. My S8+ screen fails to come on. I took it to I fix It and it would cost me $300 plus to replace the screen and fix the cracked glass on the back. I search Amazon and found this phone. What a find! I'm very pleased with this purchase. I believe it is due one more Android OS update to Android 11 when it becomes available. I'll keep this phone for five years before I buy another.,2020年8月7日 在美国审核
Very happy with my purchase!! Thanks!,"I am very satisfied with my Samsphone 9+ unlocked verizon phone. I felt compelled to come back and write a GREAT review seeing how so many people were unhappy with their purchases.It was very hard for me to actually bite the bullet and buy this phone because of so many bad experiences and reviews. It came in 3 days (fast) and was a third of the price if I were to purchase it brand new from Verizon which is my cell phone carrier.When I received it, it was wrapped in bubble wrap(no box or instruction manual) and had a charger not originalbut looks new and works great. There are no scratches on the phone as you can see in my pictures and set up was a breeze. Only had the phone for 2 days now and battery life is good will last me about 8 hours,I use it for everything and i have brightness on super high.. so far Not one issue.So I hope this helps you if you are on the fence about buying from this seller.",2020年10月22日 在美国审核
I Replaced the same phone model which was run over in a parking lot.,"The phone I received seemed to be brand new.Absolutely no signs of previous use.It even had a plastic screen protector already installed!When turned on I was prompted for my Samsung password.That enabled me to get all my data and apps that I originally had.Even my calendar of appointments.What a relief.All for $450 less than I paid for my old phone..The old phone is not useable because the touch screen glass was destroyed.The sim card and data card survived.Meanwhile I still hear the phone giving me sound alerts.I could have opted to just replace the glass, but the cost would have been almost the same as this replacement.Just a warning... do not drive away with the phone on the roof of your car.",2020年7月24日 在美国审核

Solid phone purchase.,"First what comes in the box.You receive the phone, a generic 1 ft. chord and the charger base to plug into a 110V wall socket. What you do not receive are headphones or any frills, this is pretty much just the phone.Second the phone itself.I have to say WOW!AWESOME! The phone was as described, like new, no scratches, dings or damage of any kind. I was able to plug it in, charge it, and take it to Verizon to have it replace my old Samsung Galaxy 5 on my account. The Samsung app to transfer data between phones worked like a charm, when I was done I could log into all of my old apps and continue on like it was the Galaxy 5 I had replaced. I lucked out and was able to get the Otterbox Defender here on Amazon and the premium shatter resistant glass screen protector from Sam's (last one in my area).Third the shipping and responsiveness of the company was great and I received it ahead of schedule. The packaging was excellent and comes with a return authorization and bag to repackage and send the phone back in case you need to.Overall and excellent phone,I have had no issues with battery life, sound, video or memory storage. Cosmetically it will be like my old G3 and G5, with the Otterbox protecting it, it will look like new when I am ready to purchase a new one again.",2020年10月16日 在美国审核

The best phone purchase I've ever made!!!,"(This is the first review I've ever written, but I had to do it because of how much I love this phone!)The essentials – The phone arrived in a plain white box and included the phone, a plug, and a USB-C cord. It did not include headphones, but that isn’t important to me.IMPORTANT – The phone did not include the tool to access the SIM Card / Micro SD Card slot. Fortunately, I had the tool from my previous phone, which worked perfectly. I imagine a paperclip would also work too! You will need one of these in order to activate your new phone.I am a total perfectionist when it comes to my electronics and this phone arrived in absolutely MINT condition. As in, no scratches whatsoever. The phone also performed like a brand new phone – Ultra fast and very responsive. Another review mentioned this, but if I had ordered a brand new phone and I received this renewed one instead, I would never even know the difference hahaAlso, deactivating my old phone and activating this one was SUPER easy. You can easily do it through the Verizon website. I did it in about 5 minutes.This phone used to cost up to $1,000 over a year ago and you can get this one for only $350. That is such an insanely good bargain I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If you are considering this phone, just get it! You will thank yourself!",2019年8月9日 在美国审核
A great deal for an amazing phone!! Highly recommend!!,"I am SO pleased with this Galaxy S9+!! I shopped around for awhile and this was the best deal by far. I was a little skeptical at first, to buy it online refurbished and unlocked, but after reading the reviews and seeing all of the positive feedback, I was confident that this was the best option.I upgraded to this Galaxy S9+ from the Galaxy S6 and had no problem transferring everything over. It couldn't have been easier! The S6 lasted me 3 years and was a great phone but I was long overdue for an upgrade and I'm amazed at all of the improvements Samsung has made between the S6 and the S9+. I've had this S9+ for 2 days and so far I'm loving it! This was not only a great deal, but so convenient as well! I didn't have to drive anywhere or deal with any sales reps or wait in any lines. I simply purchased it through Amazon Prime, and in 2 short days this beauty was waiting on my doorstep. I'm also happy that I didn't have to sign another 2 year contract with T-Mobile, my carrier. It came with a brand new Samsung fast charger and brand new ear buds as well! It takes lovely high quality pictures, is super fast, and has a lot of cool features which I'm still learning to use. This is seriously a lovely phone, the Cobalt Blue is really pretty. I highly recommend buying this phone through Amazon Prime! I'm beyond satisfied with this purchase from start to finish!

This seller was the highest priced, but I was very weary of other sellers' reviews and knew I had to get it right the first time as I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending back. So, I paid about $20 more because he had 99% positive ratings. Am not disappointed. This phone doesn't look used at all. In fact, there was part of what looks like a factory sticker on one of the edges that peeled off today while using it.(If this phone was actually used regularly I don't think this sticker would have stayed on and I'd be surprised if it was put on during refurbishment).

Fantastic cellphone for 2019/20 and next years,"This has been the best cellphone I have had. It has an amazing camera (I recommend to install gcam so you can enjoy 100% percent of camera quality). The screen quality is perfect, it is very legible, colors are accurate and the brightness levels are good. The time processing of this cellphone is just incredible, you can have a lot of apps running at the same time and it will be OK without overheating. My concern here is the battery. I mean, you could make it till the end of the day (5h and a half of screen time) and the battery is not damaged; the battery life is correct according to the Android version it has (9.0) but a friend ordered the same cellphone by this seller, and her cellphone has android 8.0 and the battery last much more. If you know how to downgrade the Android version it won't be a problem. The stereo sound of the speakers, volume and quality, is fantastic, you can enjoy of your music, and thanks to the Dolby Atmos the headphones sound is very rich. The condition of the cellphone is perfect, no scratches nor hits, the cellphone arrived very well packaged.

With the 90 day money back guarantee by Amazon, I had no hesitation in making the purchase. I have had it about 2 weeks now, and it is exactly the same as my old one! Works perfect, no problems what so ever. I have AT&amp;T prepaid. I don't do contracts. It works perfectly, no issues at all. Simply added my sim card and boom, it works immediately:). I will never buy a new phone again. Amazon will be my go to from now on!",2021年4月24日 在美国审核
Does what the 1400 Dollar Phones do at a Quarter of the Price,"Received my S9+ Promptly on the date the merchant advertised, I was a bit skeptical about placing the order seeing the incompatibility reviews from some buyers and receiving sub par phones. So far, the phone looks almost brand new, with no type of cosmetic damage, you know these phones are dust and pollen magnets, so do expect a little speckle or two when you pull it out, but the phone looks magnificent.I was also a bit worried about the crossover to the new phone from my old one, and it was insanely easy. Using the smart switch app, I got my contacts and data I needed right away, didn't do a full swap in because I want to be more selective with my downloads this time, but if you want to transfer ALL of your content, it is easy.The sim card was also plug and play since I had an S7 Edge for Verizon, they utilize the same micro sim, put in the phone alongside with my MicroSD, the phone reset, and I was able to make phone calls no problem. Didn't have to get the carrier on the phone or go to a verizon store. If you don't have the sim, I recommend getting it from Online suppliers, as opposed to going to the store where they will give you the salesman runaround.I will be updating the review periodicaly, the next time will be in 3 months, 6 months, etc to display the longetivity of the phone. I haven't started using it completely, and I already enjoy it way more than my S7 Edge, and I loved the S7 edge. If you're skeptic, don't be, order this phone now for 300, it's a good price, brand new they go 450-500.Edit: April 2021 and the phone is still working great. This was a great purchase to have a competent smart phone, at a quarter of the current smart phone market.",2020年8月6日 在美国审核
10/10 I will update if my opinion changes,"Got this phone after my partner got one from the same seller. Looks brand new except for a tiny little scratch at the top that does not impact the screen. I got the 9+ and was not expecting it to be as large as it is so I'll have to get used to it, but the extra screen space is great for watching videos. The color is vibrant and the camera quality is great. Love all the customizable features of Samsung products and it's great knowing you can get an almost-new quality phone for hundreds less than buying it new. So far 10/10 would purchase again.

The customer service was very helpful and I received a replacement within 48 hours, so I was very happy about that. The replacement is what I expected and the camera is great. This phone was an upgrade from a Galaxy S4. Needless to say, it is much faster and the battery life is much longer neither of which really surprised me. The technology is, after all, quite a bit more advanced than the S4. Getting it setup for my account was a breeze.",2019年8月18日 在美国审核

Phone came like new and worked with my Verizon SIM card right out of the box,"Phone came out of the box looking brand spanking new. Couldn't detect even hairline scratching on front, back or edges. I slapped in my Verizon SIM card from my 6 year old gs7 and booted it up. Voila. Working exactly as expected, not a single issue thus far with the phone itself. Battery charge lasts a ridiculously long time. Still have a 55% charge after using it all day long with normal applications (no video).Phone came in a generic cardboard box and was packaged well with bubble wrap. Probably could have pitched it at the wall while still packaged and phone would have been fine. Also came with a very generic and cheap USB C charging cable and an even cheaper wall power brick. This was the only thing I could find wrong. The wall power brick actually did not work at all out of the box, even when using it with various different cables. I ended up throwing it in the garbage. This was OK in the end, as I have a ton of these laying about the house. But for someone that does not have extras this would be incredibly inconvenient and annoying. Still, I give this 5 stars because the phone itself is in like-new condition and worked flawlessly out of the box with my Verizon SIM card that is 6+years old.",2020年6月29日 在美国审核

I love this phone,"I decided to get a renewed version of this phone because I was dying to have a new phone. my old phone was just terrible. It got the job done but I wanted a nice flagship phone. I couldn't afford to get the brand new s10 so I got the renewed version of this because it's guaranteed by Amazon and it's only a year old. I thought what the heck if all goes wrong I can just call Amazon. It was literally so cheap. It came in amazing conditions. I made sure to look into the sellers so I wasn't buying from a crappy seller. The phone I received looked like it was very well taken care of. all it had was some small scratches but honestly I wasn't expecting it to be in brand new condition because it's not. If you decide to risk it, I mean you have amazon to lean on and as long as you look for a good seller you should be fine. I recommend you order a fast charger if you do the charger I got didn't supportfast charging. Hope this helps.",2019年7月16日 在美国审核

Can't say on the battery dude that this is a Christmas gift so I opened it up to make sure it works and re-boxed it but for the time I had it on the battery seems fine.

Would recommend... But one glaring issue!,"Excellent price for an above fair condition of phone. Besides a very small scratch that is only visible when the screen is off or displaying something completely white, there was no burn-in nor dead pixels. Battery life has been substantially higher than the S7 I upgraded from. I have had this phone since July 13th of 2019, it is now January 12th almost exactly 6 months later and the only problem I have experienced was the fingerprint scanner.<br><br>(Before I go on about this anecdote, I still recommend buying this phone refurbished [though, I don't remember the exact seller])When I first got the phone, I had zero issues with the scanner. After a month the phone had shut down twice unexpectedly, and I tried my best to ignore this but then noticed the phone began shutting down with much more frequency. The pattern I picked up on was that the phone would turn off and reset about 10 seconds after turning off the screen. It turned out that there was some sort of software/hardware complication that when the phone entered rest and turned on the fingerprint scanner to constantly scan so you could turn it on with your finger without pressing any buttons-- it'd instead turn off. Disabling the fingerprint scanner, as painful as it was since the position is perfect right under the camera's on the back-center, fixed this issue entirely.Overall, I am really happy with this phone. Just wish the fingerprint scanner didn't cause problems like it did because when it worked, it was fast and convenient.</br></br>",2020年1月13日 在美国审核

Hesitant about buying refurbished? Don't let anxiety get the best of you!,"Just got this phone today and I'm LOVING it so far! It arrived on time and came with a wall adapter and USB-C charger cable (no SIM card remover tool - fortunately, I had one from my previous phone). Looks and works just like new - there was only a very minor scratch on the back of the phone, but it will be covered up by a case in a few days, so it doesn't matter. This was an upgrade from my Galaxy S7 (also a fantastic phone - the reason I upgraded was because I just wanted something newer, but I couldn't afford a new phone through Verizon). Switching my Verizon SIM card from my S7 to this phone was a seamless process and I had service within seconds, and SmartSwitch moved over my messages and apps quickly. Haven't had the chance to play with all of the bells and whistles yet, but I can say that the camera is awesome! Like so many, I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone through Amazon as opposed to buying a new phone through Verizon (which is all I'd ever done until now), but I took the chance and so far, I have no regrets!

Very happy with this phone,"The phone arrived looking brand new. I have T-Mobile service, so took it to one of their stores and they transferred everything from my very old phone to the new phone - contacts, text messages, even apps.( I did have to re-enter usernames and passwords in apps.) I have no complaints. The S9+ is a great phone and I got it for the price of a Moto G7. I'm still under the Amazon 90 day warranty;if anything changes, I will update this review.Update - I've had it for over 7 months now and still excellent.",2020年3月25日 在美国审核
"overall, exceeded expectations",Got this phone in a nice white box fitted well for the phone. No flaws as of yet been using it for 2 weeks and all I had to do is call us cellular at 8 pm someone was standing by to help me get this phone activated using my old sim no issues at all. But I will say the face recognition is nowhere near as good as my wife's iPhone 11 pro but in my opinion every other aspect is better more organized functions and can do most things better or equal to the iPhone absolutely no blemishes on the phone itself. And I have put a screen protector AND a case with built in protector turned up sensitivity works great,2020年9月29日 在美国审核

Not Fully unlocked or fully Verizon compatible,"This phone does not have Video calling available and after a lengthily session with Verizon, they said it is because the phone is not fully unlocked, or not Fully Verizon compatible and there is no way to turn the video on for this phone. Other than that it seems to work OK, but there appears to be some other features missing in the various menu's.As wellSince video calling is the primary reason I bought this phone it is of little use to me.As a side note, the packaging it shipped in was very poor. There was minimal packing material and the phone was rattling around quite a bit. Luckily it was not damaged by the other stuff that was tossed in the box, like the charger, cord, etc.Update, after talking with Verizon I did contact Amazon support by phone for this product. I got through after a minimal wait and worked with the Amazon rep Juan. We reviewed what Verizon had told me and went though the steps to enable Video on this phone, but it was just not available in the menus.Verizon did confirm that video is enabled on my account. Since other features were also not available in the Menus I decided to send this phone back and try again.",2020年2月9日 在美国审核

Disappointed,"Phone sold was great since bought in April 2021. Now October 21, 2021 AT&amp;T removes phone from network because of some features of the Galaxy s9 plus will not work in February 22, 2022 with the drop of 3G. So in short beware of good deals on Amazon of cell phones like this Samsung Galaxy s9 plus that I purchased for my son to save money of course. The phone was manufactured around March 2018. Not quiet 3 years old but was a great flagship Samsung phone. Phone worked without any problems but with the BIG 3G drop the next great deal on cell phones may not work long on any Carrier. So BEWARE and buy something that don't get dropped by your phone carrier after six months just because we try to purchase cell phones from sellers on Amazon to save money. Thete should be someway the sellers on here should discontinue selling cell phones that will not work on any 3G network in 2022. I will still be looking for my next good deal because the Big cell phone carriers charge to much for new cell phones and even a cell phone two years old could be too old for the phone carrier to keep on their network because all the features will not work on 4G or 5G.",2021年10月23日 在美国审核

This phone is the best you can never go wrong when you buy it,The battery life to this phone is so good once I charted up in the morning I can go with the phone the least 2 days without charging it again until the next morning I think that was really really cool,2020年10月31日 在美国审核
Phone is in pristine condition!!,"I am elated about my purchase of the renewed Galaxy S9+ with locked AT&amp;T !The phone was in pristine condition, I couldn't find a single nick or scratch on it, front or back. Every thing worked perfectly. I have only had the phone for 2 days but no issues yet, figure I can't lose with a 90 day warranty anyway. I was extremely sceptical after reading some of the bad reviews in here, I did notice most of them were years old and others weren't actually purchased from this seller, also the majority were good reviews. I received my phone in 3 days after ordering it was in a debranded phone box. It came with a new USB-C cable a and a generic fast charging wall plug, which worked excellent. The phone came completely discharged of battery, but I think that's because if air mailing restrictions. I had the phone charged to 50% in about 20 minutes and started setting up.Because it was AT&amp;T locked (just as advertised) which is my carrier, I just popped my sim in and off I went. The battery life is nearly as good as new, I'm not even sure this phone was used at all?If you're debating on buying an Amazon renewed phone, don't wait, just do it!My wife will need a new phone soon and this is exactly where we're going to buy it.If I could give this purchase more than 5 stars, I would.",2020年4月9日 在美国审核

Amazon Renewed description very inaccurate!  Avoid CR Daily Deals!,"My phone died and I was on vacation.I purchased this Amazon Renewed device on 7-30 so it would be waiting at home when we got home on 8-2.The order was placed with CR Daily Deals and it arrived on 8-1.Imagine my disappointment when I opened it Friday and noticed all the chips and scratches.The front of the phone has a lot of scratches and chips in the top right.They are very noticeable when the phone screen is off.The back of the phone has several scratches on the middle right and is chipped up around the camera, flash and fingerprint area where someone has a case on it and it got beat up around the opening.One side of the phone has a chip on the black surface that is noticeable since you can see the metal under it.The description for Amazon Renewed states clearly ""The products have no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away.""These scratches and chips are very noticeable more than a foot away.I put my sim card in and the phone did work on Verizon.Thus far the phone has operated as intended and everything appears to be fine.Amazon either needs to adjust the description to state the phone may have scratches on the front, back and side noticeable at arms length or more or put CR Daily Deals on notice or remove them from this item.Phone works fine, but highly disappointed a paid top dollar for a phone is such poor shape.Unfortunately I cannot go without a phone again waiting for a return.I could have gotten this same phone in this condition much cheaper on Swappa!I overpaid and feel ripped off based on the condition!",2019年8月12日 在美国审核

Other than that, everything works as expected and the battery life is just as good as my old phone. Feeling I hit the online jackpot not receiving a lemon.Update #2:Frustrated it now being the phone is now turning off when not in use, also hearing a ticking noise when it restarts and I let it sit.Thinking it could be the battery since its not holding a charges more.

Clean phone works great. mind you the generic charger may not be same specs as OEM,"I love the S9+ phone which is why I wanted another one. And this renewed phone by Amazon was well worth the purchase.I will start with the negative aspects of buying this used/renewed phone. This is not a review of the S9+ itself. There are plenty of phone reviews since this is far from a newly released phone.1. Charger - Not a fast charger. So not comparable to what originally came with the phone.While the product description said ""The device does not come with headphones or a SIM card. It does include a charger and charging cable that may be generic."" But it didn't say that the generic charger might not be a quick charger which is what the S9 Plus normally comes with. The phone takes a long time to charge this way and you will have to factor in the cost of buying a compatible Adaptive Fast Charger. Keep that in mind as you watching pricing. I purchased Amazon Renewed in case I wasn't happy and I recommend you do as well.Solution = Additional purchase of a compatible Adaptive Fast Charger.2. The included version of Android = 9This took the most amount of time to do and was not painless. It came with the original version of Android that the phone released with back in 2018. I have fast internet and allowed it to download the T-mobile OTA (Over the Air) firmware update to Android 10. The download was fast. But it took a long time to apply the update and update all the apps after that. And after the update was done, it had a security update to do but failed with ""Firmware update error 407"". While everything was working, I wanted the security update to install. I tried multiple things and forget the exact fix. But I think it was going to Settings -&gt; Software Update and tapping UICC unlock, then rebooted and tried again and it installed just fine.Solution = Upgrade to latest Android 10 yourself after you are fully setup with your carrier.3. Screen - Minimal hair-fine scratches. But was hiding behind a bad screen protector.My phone also came with a curved hard screen protector added. It made the screen look grey/light as it did not sit directly on the screen but with a small air gap. I believe the only reason they added the screen protector was to hide the tiny scratches in the original glass screen. But it it harder to see in bright light and created glare on the selfie camera as it was over the lens. Luckily since it is only held on by adhesive on the top and bottom edge, it was easy to pull off the phone.Solution = Remove the protector. If you want a screen protector, I recommend one that seals onto the screen glass so there is no air gap.Those are my only downsides to this renewed product experience.Now for the positives.Screen: Rating 9/10 - No image burn in which can happen even on OLED. Bright and no dead/stuck pixels. Very clean screen once the protector was removed. While I could see the fine surface scratches when viewing the glare at an angle and close inspection, they are very minimal and I don't notice them at all with the screen on and in use.Battery: 10/10 - Used it for more than 2 weeks now. Battery appears to be working like brand new. lasts all day long and works better than my other S9+ that I have owned since March 2018. Fast charging via cable and wireless both charge fast. And I do a lot of social media and photos. Battery is great. While I don't have the tools to grade the battery, I would say it's definitely better than the 80% renewed minimum of the product description.Sound: 10/10 - Both speakers are clean sounding. No abnormal distortions. Headphone jacks audio is clean as well. All audio working perfectly.Buttons: 10/10 - Vol up/down, Bixby, and power buttons feel sturdy and click like new.Fingerprint reader and HR sensor: 10/10 - Fingerprint reader is fast and works perfectly. HR/O2 sensor works perfectly.Cameras: 10/10 - Both selfie and rear camera lens are perfectly clean and clear with no defects and no scratches. Images and optical stabilization perfect in pictures and video. Flash bright and not faded with wear.Mics: 10/10 - mic pickup is clean with no issues for calls and video.Touchscreen: 10/10 - nothing to report.Phone exterior: 9/10 - Rear is very clean and seems to have less scratches than the glass. Was likely always in a case like it is now. Dropped 1 point for the minimal screen scratches that I already talked about.I can confidently say buying Amazon Renewed is worth doing. Nothing to lose with the 90 day return policy.",2020年8月27日 在美国审核

4G LTE does not work on this phone!,"Save yourself the time and skip this vendor,Nothing worked properly, some of which I outline below. But worse, much worse, and thenI return it and they charge me $100. Bucks restocking fee! Terrible!First thing I Discovered is that the phone only works at two or 3GLTE and not 4G LTE. I am using a third-party carrier who uses AT&amp;T towers. Spoke with AT&amp;T several times to no avail. They tell me to talk to my phone provider who tells me to talk to AT&amp;T who tells me to talk to my phone provider. You see how it goes? On top of that I have had random problems like being told that I can only make emergency calls when trying todial local numbers in my contacts list.. The phone did look excellent when it arrived, however, there seems to be something a little off with it other than the above mentioned Issues. If I can’t get things resolvedsoon, back it goes. Sounds like calling Samsung might be my last resort. I would only purchase this phone if you were going to be on the AT&amp;T network using AT&amp;T as the carrier. Whatever you do do not under any circumstances attempt to use the draw a line feature for unlocking and locking your phone. It’s a total nightmare that doesn’t work properlyand then it’s very very tough to figure out how to bypass it.",2019年9月23日 在美国审核

Disappointed,"I am giving this phone a 2 stars. This was the third phone that I have purchased through Amazon over the years. I have always been confident in the quality of the renewed phones. That said, This phone arrived in a box that was in good condition but the phone was only wrapped inside a thin bubble wrap sleeve and the charger cord and plug, rattling around in an interior box. I looked the phone over and did not see any apparent damage. A few days later I noticed while taking a photo outside that the camera lens was cracked. If you held it at an angle the cracks were not visible. I had had the phone for less than 9 days at that point. I contacted customer service via on line chat and was issued a return. I received the replacement phone today. Comparing the two I can see that the previous phone had had the back replaced and an noticed the camera lens stuck out much more than the new one received.The phone I am returning also had some audio issues when speaking on the phone.",2021年6月22日 在美国审核

This worked out well,"When I ordered this phone I had my doubts that I was going to get a nice phone. S&amp;D stands for scratched and dented and I really expected I would get a phone with less than attributable appearance. I was wrong. The phone had no evidence that it had been used by anyone. Like me, they must have had it all wrapped in a nice case and screen protector and wanted a high trade-in value when they updated to a newer model The phone has worked well and I am still learning the newer features coming from a Samsung S3 and a Note 5 that I couldn't use it as a phone due to my not checking if it wasn't a marked phone from Verizon. It was. Friends.<br>I took the phone to a Verizon store to make certain it would work on their network and because my old Samsung S3 could not connect to WiFi to do the transfer, something you should be able to do at home. Everything went as it should. The battery charged up without any problems and holds a charge as expected. The Verizon rep got me set-up in under an hour and everything has worked as expected since then. The phone package was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and only included a stock charge cord and connector. If you are expecting to get a nice set of earbuds as if this is brand new phone, well you're out of luck at this price. Overall,I couldn't be more pleased with how this has turned out.*I will update this review if there is anything new to add as time permits.</br>",2020年1月30日 在美国审核

Lock screen never unlocks!,"When I received the phone I immediately noticed that there were some cosmetic problems, but as it's a renewed phone I decided to look past this. However within a couple hours of using the phone it started taking anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute to unlock! The power button works about 1 out of 10 times to bring the lock screen up, occasionally the face recognition works, and sometimes the fingerprint scanner works to unlock it. I'm just continuously stuck looking at a black screen waiting for the phone to recognize my attempts to use it! I've spent more time waiting for the phone to unlock than actually using it! Next, the phone continues ringing after you've answered a call so you have either the ringtone or vibration in the background while you are trying to talk, and that is if it allowed you to answer it in the first place. Sometimes when you try to answer the answer button doesn't respond and again your stuck staring at the phone screen waiting for it to work. I really wanted to like this phone as it has a great camera- unfortunately the camera isn't enough to justify keeping a phone that I can't possibly use! Will be returning.",2021年1月14日 在美国审核

"REALLY GOOD CELLPHONE BUY - NOT PERFECT BUT VERY, VERY GOOD","My older S8+ had more problems than a junk yard dog has fleas so I needed an ECONOMICAL replacement. This seller's refurbished &amp; unlocked S9+ was a perfect fit. The S9+ arrived one day earlier than projected. Cosmetic appearance over all was almost perfect. There was one chip out of the phone's front glass. The chip was on the extreme left edge and not in a place that affected the phone's utilization. Powered on the phone (battery was 80% charged) and connected it to the AT&amp;T network with no problem. Powered it off and transferred my SIM card from the S8+. Phone then came back on with absolutely no problems. There were several updates that needed to be performed in sequence all of which transpired with no problem. I then used the SAMSUNG supplied transfer app to migrate my information to the S9+. Simply laid the two phones next to another and told it to transfer all. The migration was painless and worked flawlessly. BTW, battery life per charge has been quite good.I am now off and running using my 'newer' S9+ and am quite happy with this purchase.",2020年4月30日 在美国审核

Excellent quality for an excellent price,"I've always loved Samsung products from their televisions to telephones. I previously had a Huawei Honor 7X and wanted something similar in size and capacity. The Galaxy series has received rave reviews from techies around the world so the choice was not difficult to make when I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S9 plus. The refurbished phone came with little to no scratches or imperfections with the exception of the fingerprint reader. The phone was previously registered to Verizon but came unlocked and ready to receive a SIM card from the service of my choice. I was able to set it up with StraightTalk same day. It is quite beautiful. The only thing I can say I see as a downfall are the rounded edges of the screen because of how difficult they make it to find glass screen protectors that fit and don't fracture after application. Other than that and one very minor cosmetic imperfection, this phone gets a 10/10 for speed, storage capacity, capability and camera quality. I'm pleased to say the very least! The supplier did an incredible job of making sure this phone met their pre-owned standards. I will be purchasing from them again!",2022年1月28日 在美国审核

I think I am in love again,"I have been a Samsung phone user for many years now.I also have a Samsung TV, Blu-Ray player, and sound bar.I love my Samsung products.I bought this S9+ renewed to replace my S8 that was dropped one too many times and is pretty cracked on the screen and back case.It still works, mostly, but it was time to upgrade.I love the S9+.The only negative so far is because it is an unlocked phone, I do not have some of the ring and alert tones I am used to and there is no Visual Voice mail.Lesson learned for next time.With the Samsung Smart Switch app, I was able to easily transfer all of my apps (along with data for most of them), all my photos/videos, and most of my settings.The ringtones were an issue due to the unlocked phone.I love the bigger screen, the faster processor, and the overall features of the the S9+.And now that it is on Android 10, that annoying Bixby page is gone and replaced with something that is infinitely more useful.I was worried about battery life, but so far the battery is quite a bit better than my S8's ever was.I can go all day for about 12 to 14 hours with a decent amount of use and still have 50% battery life remaining.My S8 would have needed to be on a charger long before this one.Unfortunately I have not really given the camera a workout yet.If you are looking for an updated phone but don't want the extra expense of the S10, then I highly recommend the S9+.It's close in size to the Note series, has extra onboard memory, and the battery life is really quite good.",2020年9月22日 在美国审核

Phone Is As Advertized (Verizon Wireless Version),"The S9+ was in great shape on arrival however the box it came in was a little worse for ware. Charged to 100% and setup was excellent like a fresh factory phone from Samsung.The Smart Switch app is preloaded w/ auto-start so transferring files from the old S7 phone was a 3 step process and easy.Transferred 25GB of files, apps, photos and videos in about an hour over wireless. The apps that were transferred worked as if installing from the Play store.Installed a 128GB micro SD and transferred the S7 sim card using a small paper clip since there is no release clip that comes with the unit. Verizon accepted the new phone without issue. This is a good, low cost purchase and recommended if you want to stick with 4G tech.",2021年3月31日 在美国审核

So far.I will update as I use the phone, but so far as a renewed Samsung phone this is looking to be well worth the money.If it wasn't for previous purchases of renewed products on Amazon, the reviews on this product likely would have made me look elsewhere.

Best phone I've ever owned.,"My phone arrived in perfect condition. Works well with Metro-PCS. Prepaid service.Great cameras front and rear. The battery life is excellent, lasts over a day with moderate use. Wireless charging is fast for this model. My previous Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge required frequent recharging to get me through the day so having a phone that holds a charge is very nice. Having a 6.2 inch (ca. 16 cm) screen is really nice as well. This phone feels premium quality in every way. The phone feels well-balanced and comfortable in my hand. The fingerprint sensor is nicely placed and very responsive. IRIS scanner is fast and works well. I appreciate the stereo speakers, they are much better than the mono speaker in previous generations of the phone. This phone was a great value in my opinion. The phone can be slippery in the hand. I recommend getting a good case for it.",2020年3月20日 在美国审核

Regardless, this phone is great.Much better than the S7 I had been using.I had absolutely no issues with switching my sim card/SD card to the new device.Phone was unlocked as stated.I merely put the sim card from my old phone into the new one, and it immediately started working on my current network.There wasnt ANY branding IE Sprint, Verizon etc. in the phone.Always nice to have a clean slate.I definitely reccomend this product to others in the market.",2019年1月29日 在美国审核

Verizon - Galaxy s9+ Midnight - Very satisfied,"Great deal! Not really interested in buying a $1k new phone again. Got this to replace my cracked s9+ and couldn't be happier. They were quick to refund me for a previous one I returned that was a little dimmer than I had liked. I had to wait until it was delivered to them unlike when it's an Amazon return where the refund is almost instant. Not really a huge issue but your money is locked up a bit longer if you plan to use it or are using credit.<br>Likes: Hardware performance is unremarkable and matched my original s9+ The battery is good and seems to hold slightly longer than my original s9 SIM from my existing S9 was transferred to this and worked seamlessly 1/4 the cost of a $1k phones that do pretty much the same thing Good quality. It's used, obviously, but is very nice considering and blemishes aren't noticeable unless you look VERY CLOSELYDislikes: still slightly dimmer screen then my original s9+ but not enough to return the device. My original was cracked and still a bit brighter.</br>",2020年7月15日 在美国审核

Super Impressed with Celltraders,"First time buying a renewed phone. Since there was only 1 available from this seller, I ordered a second from another Amazon vendor.Celltraders was far and away superior in delivery. I received the phone 2 days later, shipped thru FedEx. Still waiting on the second phone, shipped via USPS a week and counting.Now the phone ... I dare you to tell the difference between a new phone and the Samsung 9+ that I received. It is pristine in condition, no scratches, dings or mars. Totally looks brand new. It's sleek, super thin and gorgeous. The face recognition feature is a security must and this works flawlessly.I do not use the fingerprint reader but did try it and wow, it works great. May use it in the future.This phone gets 5 stars, but would give Celltraders more if I could for great customer service.The phone was well packed, came with charger and cord. No documentation (you can get that online) or headphones. No biggie to me. Very fast delivery!Will definitely recommend Celltraders to family and friends.",2020年12月21日 在美国审核
"I would buy it again, no question","Love this GS9+, I upgraded from an S5 so of course I love it. As far as buying second hand, I was at least comforted buying it amazon certified so I got a warranty. I figured if it was going to be a bad decision it would manifest itself before the warranty so I bought it with confidence.I wasnt disappointed. The phone was as described, the battery last all day. The only negative is that there were some minor imperfections in the glass. I can see little Nick's in a couple of places but as described they aren't very visible at a foot or two distance, just when looked at up close (I'm a boomer so I usually have my phone all up in my face so I see them). I still think that this was a superb value for what I received at this price. I would recommend 100%",2020年3月11日 在美国审核

For 2 years old and a refurbished phone it's fantastic,I thought the phone refurbished here on Amazon because I needed to replace my stupid Moto Z3 phone that I only had for a year and it was garbage. I used to have an s6 so I was really excited to try out the s9 since I can't afford the new versions. And it made me realize how much I missed my s6 like crazy. the only downside is that the battery isn't the greatest but the phone is a couple years old so I can't hold it against that but it still gets me through a good day pending my use for that day. But overall it's a great phone the screen was great wasn't cracked or anything like that when I got it for being a refurbished. It's fast it does the job it's got good good memory to it and you can add extra memory for it as well which is great. if you need a new phone and you don't mind a refurbished or if you just want to forgot the money for a brand new one I would highly recommend this even though it's a couple years old.,2020年10月19日 在美国审核

Like it better than my V30,I left Samsung to the LG V30 a couple years ago. I have decided to comeback to this phone because I liked my wife's phone better than my V30.The camera works better for me on this phone. My V30 would struggle to focus and other little glitches that this phone doesn't seem to struggle with.There are only two things I like better about my V30. The fingerprint reader was also the power button on the back. That's more convenient and the fingerprint reader was faster. The other thing is I don't care for the rounded corners or the rounded edges of the screen. The edges I've gotten used to but the corners bug me. I like more squared off corners.I'm very happy with this phone so far though.*** Important note - I was afraid I was going to get a phone from another service provider after I ordered it because it's only unlocked from Samsung. My wife's phone I got off Ebay and they gave you the choice of service provider. Luckily the one they sent was my carrier so no issues.,2020年4月17日 在美国审核

"""Renewed"" = Defective","I ordered the renewed version of the Samsung Galaxy S9+ from Hybrid IT. They sent me a defective ""smart"" phone. It drains the battery lasting for a few hours and charges so slow to a point you cannot use the phone at all.If you ever had thought about purchasing ""renewed"" thinking again. I thought my 3 year old S8+ was way better than what I bought from Hybrid IT. The Battery lasted throughout the day. Maybe 7 - 9 hours on a regular use. And it was useable.This S9+ is not useable. Other than the gripes with battery and charging the phone performs good. That is my reason for rating this a 2 out of 5 rating. It isn't horrible like a faulty or fake device, but rather a defective and useless phone. It stays connect to the wall socket like its on life support.ATTTENTION TO DETAILANDCUSTOMER SERVICE:I also contacted Hybrid IT to see if they can assist me with they're defective phone. I emailed them stating I changed the outlet adapter and usb type-c 3 times... 3 different adapters and cables and still didn't fix my issue.Get this, they're solution to the phone's defective usb type c conntection was to send me another set of charging cables and adapter... that doesn't change the phone's slow charging state! Their cuatomer service is like communicating to a robot.Please save yourself sometime. DON'T order from HYBRID IT, they will waste your time, money and energy. And furthermore, if you're looking at ""Renewed"" please be aware these phones might be knockoffs or defective.Beaware consumers!

The phone I received was heavily scratched on the screen, so much so that it even distorts how the screen looks when it is on. There is also very noticeable and significant OLED burn in on the screen. The seller D'Tech Mobile only offered me a $15 refund for their deception. When I asked for a replacement without the damage they just told me to send it back to them for a refund. Very disappointed, I thought these ""Amazon Renewed"" devices would be held to a higher standard, but it looks like sellers are using the opportunity to sell poor condition phones without the transparency of showing photos or even describing the condition.

Great phone except tied to garbage network(T-Mobile),"Overall it's a great phone. In really good shape for a used phone. Hardly any visible damage. All of the phone's functions seem to be working just fine. This is a huge improvement from my Galaxy S7. Love the iris and face recognition security features. Sound is louder than S7 for watching videos. Or playing music without an external speaker, as long as the environment isn't too loud.That being said, since it's a T-Mobile unlocked device, even though I'm a Straighttalk customer it still uses T-Mobile's network. So when their recently went down for nearly an entire day I was unable to make or receive calls or text. I even had issues while connected to wifi. Even after buying Sprint their network is still terrible. It's no wonder why they give away so much more than other networks and have better prices on devices. It's a wonder how they're still in business.So most of the time everything runs much slower than it should. Making it hard to enjoy all of this incredible phone's features. Actually very frustrating.If you're looking to purchase this phone make sure it's not a T-Mobile phone, if possible. If it is a T-Mobile phone keep scrolling, you'll thank me, even if you have to pay a little more.",2020年6月20日 在美国审核

They did say I can return it or contact Samsung which I did but even with Samsung's help I cannot set the phone to English.I'm going to take it to my phone carrier, if they cannot fix it I'm just going to have to return it or maybe stop by the beauty store and see if the store owners recognize the language and can help me.",2020年6月18日 在美国审核
Great Quality Phone,"The only thing that was difficult for me was actually receiving this phone. The seller had requested the package be signed for which I did not realize in advance.

It runs quickly. The screen is huge.

"S9 plus is a really nice phone, great camera","Freezing issues, the screen was not touch sensitive, the lighting would turn on to high and it was hard to turn it down. I tried to ignore the defects but I didn't want to keep it and other problems surfaced. This was a renewed phone. The price should have been cheaper, after dealing with the hassle of returning it.

Great Phone....Great Price!,I was looking to upgrade my Samsung and did not want to pay full price. I was skeptical about purchasing a refurbished phone because you never know if all of the problems have been fixed. I decided to buy it anyway and so far so good. The only imperfection that is quite noticeable is the fingerprint sensor is very worn.,2019年9月22日 在美国审核
So far it's money!,"So it's been just under 24 hours and I'll be honest, i feel like i got a GREAT deal! The phone looks brand spankin new! No visable wear or damage and all functions and features are working flawlessly thusfar! I was VERY nervous after reading many of the bad reviews but figured worst case i could always just return it but I'm happy i was worrying over nothing! Now I'll be sure to update this review in something like 3 months time so that it isn't just new phone adrenaline that's painting a rosy picture here... Oh to be a bit more in depth...like all the other reviewers the phone arrived in a non branded box with no earphones and an aftermarket charger. All of this information is clear and upfront so there were no surprises when i received the order. The phone was wiped of any personal data and was locked to Att like advertised so i was able to throw my sim in and have no issues getting service instantly. The fingerprint reader, the speakers both earpiece and speakerphone, the front screen and rear glass.... All of it FLAWLESS so far! Very happy with my purchase...So I've had the phone for roughly 45 days and I still LOVE it! Everything still work omg perfectly and i am beyond happy with my purchase....",2019年6月5日 在美国审核

Not a problem for me as I don't notice them when using the phone, which appears to be good as new otherwise. The packaging was basically a bunch of dirty paper and tape slapped together, but the phone still got here in one piece. It came with a really cheap charger and cable (not Samsung). I was skeptical when I opened the package, but the phone is legit, and I'm happy.Plugged in my Verizon sim card from an S7 and it worked immediately. Better 4G reception than I got on my S7.

One time it actually connected for a few minutes, but then dropped and never returned after additional resets (including 2 full factory resets). I tried calling the seller during their stated office hours but only received a voicemail each time. I emailed also and have not received anything back. I've spent way too much time on this device.

Good condition good value,So I'm on the fence for this one. The fingerprint scanner causes the entire phone to glitch. Turns out it's a common problem with the s9 series. Seems like samsung would want to have patched that for one of their flagship models. As for the phone being refurbished it seems to function well although it has some low sensitivity areas on the touch screen when you use the included tempered glass. I purchased new protectors and they seem much better. I am still having intermittent signal issues but I really am not sure if that's just my carrier. The phone arrived in good shape for being refurbished no damage to the screen and just a light scratch on the back probably from a case it was in. Overall I'm fairly happy with it. I wouldn't mind purchasing another phone from this seller in the future.,2019年12月5日 在美国审核

Problems started 10 months after I bought it!,"I was so happy when I purchased this device. I thought I made a great deal by buying it refurbished, even though I paid almost 800$ for it.10months after my purchase, it started showing a defect saying a moisture detected, and beeping till I unplug the charger. This while it wasn't dropped in the water or anything. so each time I had to keep it in the rice for 2days to make it work. This problem happened twice till the last time when the screen just froze. I couldn't understand what happened, it wouldn't react, won't even turn off. I looked in the internet what to do, had to reboot it. when I rebooted it, it worked for 10min and then again nothing. kept doing that the whole day: rebooting, removing apps I thought could have somehow impacted (incl. Sportify, which was on when this happened), cleaning the cache, ..), nothing helped. by the end, it the screen just went black. When we took it to Samsung store, we were told that the motherboard issue. I live now in the UK, and as the phone was purchased in the US, 1/ there's no warranty here and 2/ the motherboards are built differently.To cut it short, I suffered for almost a week with all that and ended up by buying a new phone!! I bought a new phone 1year and 2 months after I purchased this defected Samsung. this device is only 2years from manufacturing date! I thought I was investing in a good brand, a good model but it turned out that it was a HUGE mistake!And I don't even know what to do! to whom to write! I want a compensation for all the stress and the inconvenience created! I want to understand if it can still be fixed in the USA and if yes, where!",2020年2月11日 在美国审核
"No issues, seller is legit","Phone is fine, nothing special, GPS seems off, assuming because it is refurbished. Looks new, no problems. Still says Verizon on it, but works fine on Sprint. At first Sprint said the phone couldn't be hooked up, but that is simply because their agents are very poorly trained, I have never gotten a correct answer feom a single Sprint call center agent in the 15 years I have had them. Just take it directly to a Sprint store and they can hook it immediately. Soon any phone you buy should work with any carrier anyways. Seller is fine, Samsung is just becoming greedily priced. There are actually better brands that are still unknown and 1/3 of the price out there. For instance Umidigi. Got this one simply because the fam wanted it due to being used to the brand. I would purchase from this Vendor again.",2019年4月5日 在美国审核

Great phone but need more flexibility on the returns.,I have had this for a couple months. The headphone Jax does work very well and it won't let me use Samsung video calling feature. However everything else seems to work fine. The low score is on the return system. My other phone can't hold the same capacity so I am unable to return this phone and get a new one or I will lose the new info on this phone.They will only give you the option of buying another and then returning or sending the current one back and them sending out a new phone. Which would put you out of commission for a few days. That is something I haven't been able to do. They do communicate with you about the return which is great but no resolution for me. I did buy another phone but it had more issues than this one. So I accepted the lesser of the two.,2020年8月17日 在美国审核

"Solid price on a great smartphone in near-mint condition (aftermarket charger &amp; no ""extras"" though)","Maybe I just got really lucky, but the S9+ that I recieved was in perfect condition with zero signs of wear anywhere. I was a little disappointed that the charger was aftermarket (Sharkk branded AC-to-USB plug / brick/block - which I'm actually a fan of the brand) as there are some odd situations where Samsung products nag for Samsung branded/approved charging devices. There was NO literature about the phone, nor anything like phones included in the box, etc. My main gripe is there was no ""ejector tool"" for opening up the sim card / SD card ""slot bracket"" - How are you going to use an unlocked phone without needing this tool? The ejector tools are crazy cheap as you can bulk buy 100+ of them for around $8 on Amazon, though I feel like this is all the more reason to toss one in the box. If the ejector tool came with this refurb-ed phone, I would have certainly given the seller 5 stars, though. The phone was in perfect condition, well packaged and at least there was a fast-charge capable USB+Charger block of some kind included in the ""white label"" box that it arrived in. I'm not disappointed at all with the actual phone itself for the amount paid. If you don't already have one, I'd recommend buying an ejector tool with this phone purchase too though. Especially if you are using some of SIM card thats from a less popular carrier service like TextNow, FreedomPop or anytime you're order a SIM from the web somewhere.",2019年2月18日 在美国审核

The Cosmic Phone of the Galaxies series,"I am so happy to find this phone at such a reasonable price. Samsung Galaxy S9 is fast, reliable in security in terms of fingerprint recognition, and has plenty of room to download necessary apps. The wireless charging feature also works and the phone takes fantastic pictures as well. P.S (the photos from above are taken from my iPad).<br>With pros comes some of the cons as well. The speaker is relatively weak, so getting a Bluetooth speaker is recommended. Although it arrives in great condition, for the most part, there is a scratch near the fingerprint reader. The battery life is okay, however it is not the greatest either. It runs out of battery relatively fast and takes about three hours to get to a hundred percent.However considered that it was a renewed phone, it is still worth the price.

They arrived the day before we were expecting them, and honestly, they looked brand-new. My husbands phone is slightly harder to push buttons, but that's about it. The only problem with my phone was that spotify wouldn't open, but we fixed that. I am extremely happy with both of our phones. Not only that, but i didn't have a screen-saver on it right away, and when I dropped it, the screen didn't even have a scuff. I was very surprised, to be honest. EVERYTHING was perfect with them. We're a month in, and they're still STUPID fast. I also have Tmobile, and for both of our phones, we just inserted our sims, and called it good.

"Renewed, but flawed. Works great.","This is my updated review after a week of having it. I've decided, its a good phone. I'll keep it. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. Only (3) recurring issues I'm having. I fully charged it the moment I took it out the box. The phone itself is perfect. No damages, scratches or missing anything on the phone itself.So.. my issues are:(1) It goes straight to the home screen, while I'm using certain apps. It does it frequently.(2) It makes a loud vibration sound when I power it on.(3)the speakers are blown. Can't listen to anything on it. I mean, I can, just very low.(4) there is a MAJOR echo on the phone. when I listen to my gps navigation, YouTube music, or use music on Instagram stories, and when I access my home camera live. Its obnoxious. Tried to reset the phone and update all my apps, clear cache, re-install the apps, but the echo remains.It's flawed for being ""renewed,"" however, instead of sending it back, I have decided to keep it. Its not bad to where it's not functional, or to where its damaged. Just flawed, but hey, it's still a phone. it's just, you buy a renewed phone and think everything would be fully functional at least. I blame myself for not checking the speaker before installing all my data and setting it up. Just had no clue. It's still a good working phone. I would say I recommend PRIME W for renewed phones, because they're still good working phones. Some might have some flaws, but you're buying a used phone. Just make sure to check all functions before setting up. Still a good phone. Amazon has been amazing. Excellent customer service.

Don't Bother With Negative Reviews,"Don't listen to the negative reviews about this phone seller. I got my refurbished phone in near excellent condition, with a screen protector, and under Verizon as promised. I just had to use the Smart Switch app and transfer my SIM card after.

Worth It,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S6 (which I gave to my son), so keep in mind I have no experience with the intervening models, but I am quite pleased with this phone! That 256gb is internal btw; no memory card. I read that the Plus models have more battery life, and that's proving true. I had no trouble activating it with a Verizon SIM card, and the only drawback I've found (keeping it from 5 stars) is that Verizon apparently hard-codes its voicemail app - it's not available for download from the PlayStore unlike other providers', so I'm looking for a good 3rd party visual voicemail app. Any suggestions?",2020年9月26日 在美国审核

Phone arrive in bad state,Been playing around with the phone and something is off. I get an Google Play protect that a malware is blocked. There are minor scuffs around the edges.

The batter indicator is all off as it tells me I'm about empty but it's actually at 70% when I shutdown.The phone also has wrong infos when I check the status.The serial number all wrong as well as the memory size and storage.

Was a little weird hearing the voice fom the box, lol.The seller did leave a card in the box asking us to contact them and tell them how it was. It is after hours so I didn't call them.

So far.....VERY impressed,"I must say the product shipped very quickly. Had the product in my hand in two days after purchase. Packaging was great. Came with a charger and had about 1/4 of battery charge left. Charged it up and turned it on after inserting the my sim card and has been running ever since with no issues. There were some cosmetic issues on the phone but nothing that warranted concern. One small scratch on the screen. The finger print reader on the back looks damaged but works really well. The charging port has scratches around it but the plug still fits tight and no problems charging. To say I am happy with the purchase is an understatement. Would definitely recommend purchasing from this seller. Just remember this is not a ""new"" phone so it will not be perfect but close and for half the price of a new phone.",2019年12月17日 在美国审核

Can't figure out what was different, but I have since gotten used to it and I don't notice anymore. Love love love the fingerprint sensor.

Budget extra for a proper charger and cord,"The phone was in fantastic shape. Exactly as advertised, and a full 5 star quality. Shipping was slow, but that wasn't something the seller can control. Most things are shipping slowly right now. The reason I knocked 2 stars off of the review is because it came with a Dollar-store quality charger and cord. The first thing I did after opening the box was run out to Best Buy and buy the proper charger and cord for the phone, an additional expense I should not have had to make. Cheap cords are fine for occasional use, but will ruin your battery and the life of your phone over time.For what I paid considering this is a refurbished late-model phone I expected it to come with the appropriate peripherals. I've never ordered a refurbished product that didn't, so the possibility of it didn't even cross my mind. Like I said, the phone is great and I'm happy with it. I'm not going to give the seller a hard time or anything, just keep it in mind when making your purchase.",2021年1月15日 在美国审核

Great purchase,"This refurbished phone is a great value. I had previously been using a Galaxy Note 4 (ancient, I know) and loved it, but as with all electronics, they become obsolete as they age. I wanted to get a new Note 10+, but the price was just too much so we decided to take a chance and buy renewed, this S9+ was what was in our budget.It came in an unmarked brown box, no accessories except a charger, which is fine because it's not a new phone. There was a scratch on the back cover and the tiny panel below the camera, the color was rubbed off, not sure why, but I was a bit peeved there. The screen was in excellent condition which was the important part. The phone was almost completely changed right out of the box so I finished charging it and turned it on. I did have to go to my provider to get the SIM punched, but that wasn't too big a deal.The phone turned on and prompted me through set up, just like a new phone would, and I had tons of cool new features I wasn't used to which was another plus. I've had this phone for a couple months now, no issues. I'm pleased with this purchase overall! So much so that when my husband broke his S9 we purchased another one of the exact same. He's had his for only a couple days, but we are pleased with this one so far as well.Definitely saves money over getting a new phone and performs exactly like it should. I would recommend.",2020年1月5日 在美国审核

Phone, camera, screen, fingerprint reader, and facial recognition all work perfectly.The process to set up the phone was super smooth (My prior phone was linked with samsung account)I would have gave 5 stars but the charger and block included were faulty upon arrival.Bottom line, great product at an amazing price.",2020年5月7日 在美国审核

The unlocked verizon GSM phone works on straight talk.,I am very happy with my purchase from AE cells. I ordered a Samsung 9+ and received it in beautiful condition and worked right out of the box. I use straight talk as a service provider and was unsure if I ordered the right product. AE cells listed it as a Verizon phone unlocked GSM. I happen to use the verizon towers with straight talks prepaid wireless. It was as simple as taking my sim card out of my old phone and putting it in the S9+.

Hairline crack,"So I received the Samsung S9+ 2 days ago, and yes, it was what I would expect from a renewed phone-- a few minor blemishes such as chips on the paint around the edges. However, the reason I gave the touch 2 stars is not because it wasn't working, on the contrary it worked great... it was the fact that I woke up this morning to find two hairline cracks on the top right of the screen, which got me upset since I did nothing with the phone that should have caused this. I know this is not necessarily the seller's fault, its Samsung's... still, it's disappointing because I haven't even had the phone five days yet.

"Overall Good, Very Irritating Bugs with time","So, I purchased this phone somewhere between October and November of last year and for the most part it's been a good phone. Spec wise it does everything it's supposed to do, however there are some things that have made themselves apparent.At first I did not notice, but the notifications pane at the top seems to pull itself down often. Took me a few months to notice it was doing it on it's own, I actually believed I was somehow pulling it by accident. At first it was once or twice a day , fast forward a few months and it pulls down multiple times a day. You could be watching a video, trying to text anything really and that pesky window just slides down. When you push it back up there are cases when the phone is very obnoxious and pulls it right back down instantly, over and over about 10 times before it stops. This does not happen very often but it does happen.Another thing is wireless tech. This phone comes with a broad array of issues with wireless tech such as the distance not being far enough as advertised on the items. I have both airpods ans sangsung buds and whenever I put the phone in my pocket (doesn't matter which one) the sound starts to break up and skip frames. The only way to listen to music when you're in the street reliably is to hold the phone in your hand or in a shirt pocket. The range for wireless is disgusting, and I know for a fact it's specific to this phone. In large areas like NYC (Manhattan) it's a bit understandable, because there's wireless interference everywhere, but at home in the Bronx with much less interference it has the same level of struggle. Unacceptable.The Galaxy watch distance is also cut on the phone's side, disconnecting just by stepping out of the room. My other galaxy devices are all brand new and work as intended on other samsung products, but this phone has some internal issue with wireless.The accelerometer in the device is also buggy, so when using google maps or other location based services, the cone (the blue visiaul representation of which direction you're facing) is ALWAYS wrong. You could be walking in a straight line and the phone has you as if you were facing to the left or even walking backwards sometimes. It doesn't affect the overall path, it still follows you accurately, but when you're lost and trying to navigate the streets only to have the facing direction be inaccurate, you can end up walking a few blocks until you realize you're walking the wrong direction.I can deal with all of these issues, as it doesn't affect the core usage of the phone itself, but I must admit I've already been planning to replace this phone with a Galaxy S10 from the manufacturer directly, and I haven't even owned it a full year yet. If it wasn't as buggy I would wait out until the S10 drops in price, but the longer I deal with these issues the more my frustration grows.If you're getting this phone for someone elderly, a kid or a teen in school they probably won't notice any of this, but I'm a Tech Engineer working with tech everyday so for me it's very apparent.",2019年8月9日 在美国审核

It's a great upgrade from my S7.A quality camera is very important to me, which is why I kept the S7 for so long. I bought a Motorola G7 power to replace it last year, but it's camera was absolutely horrible so I waited until the S9+ price came down ~ $300 (my personal limit for phone price).I took two photos at my desk to show what it can do.I also got the Samsung View case for it.I like it, especially thet you can see calls through the cover, and deny or answer them by touching the cover.https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-View-Kickstand-Black/dp/B0797QM41DI plan to come back and update this at a later date.",2020年2月21日 在美国审核

Perfectly Mint Condition S9+ Refurbished - 1st time buying refurb,"Perfectly Mint Condition S9+ Refurbished -I was slightly hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone, but this purchase gives me confidence to prefer prefurbieshed over brand-new (considering the savings). The phone was in mint condition and the setup was as if I was the 1st owner. I don't mind that there was not the original box. The cameras on this phone are incredible. I even ended up being the de facto wedding photographer for a small reception in a less-than-ideally lit hall and the results were very impressive. I choose the phone over the Canon DSLR in that situation, due to ease of use (mind you I used to be a professional photographer). This phone rules. I don't think I'll go back to the iPhone world considering how much more advanced this phone is than a similarly priced Apple offering (refurb iPhone 7+).Highly recommended!",2019年3月15日 在美国审核

The Samsung S9+ is a great phone!,I was a bit skeptical buying a refurbished phone - but I didn't want to spend over $600 for a phone! This phone looks brand NEW and works great. I'm very pleased with this purchase! Thank you.,2020年8月18日 在美国审核
Service issues,I bought the verizon version of this phone and I have lost all service. I have been on two hour and a half long calls with tech support trying to figure out the problem. We have changed sim cards and reset a bunch of stuff and nothing has worked. The phone is great but it is virtually useless when I am not using WiFi. I have had verizon for like 20 years and have never had issues like this where I live. Looks like I am out $300.,2020年9月12日 在美国审核
"Unlocked, but with some superficial damage","I think the definition of ""renewed"" is clearly different than what one would expect from a ""factory refurbished"" unit, which I am accustomed to buying. The S9+ I received was clearly a used phone (totally expected and acceptable), but honestly looked like it was purchased by the seller as a used model, factory reset, tossed sloppily in to a generic box, and resold to me. I can't say there was any ""renewing"" of this unit as the screen has a ton of light scratches on it and the back case has scratches from what seems to be someone who never used a case. Judging by the definition of ""made to look like new,"" I would expect more attention to the superficial qualities of the device.Otherwise, this device was indeed unlocked and worked perfectly fine on a T-Mobile SIM card and appears to have decent battery life. I have not done the full testing of the touch screen, but experienced no issues with completing the OOBE, configuring apps, or playing games. I will do some more testing of the functions and battery life and potentially return this unit if anything comes up.I would have given this a higher rating for being a good price for a renewed unit, but it didn't live up to my expectations with the superficial scratching all over the place. I would have rather spent less to purchase this unit marked as used.",2019年12月5日 在美国审核

I wasn't too concerned since T-Mobile owns Metro. However, I wasn't getting any service so I had to go into a Metro store and they had to unlock it for $15.I would have given it 5 stars if it were actually unlocked, but the fix wasnt too difficult.

"Seller, are you listening?","The phone looked great out of the box, only one very minor ding on it (see photo). I transferred my sim and sd card to this and in 20 minutes it was working. Loved it for a day. I was amazed that the battery still said 100% after one day use. Then suddenly, after 32 hours of use, while talking on the phone, it shut down quickly without warning. Turns out the battery was just drained. I charged it up and while it charging, the phone said 0% for a long time, then quickly jumped to 100%. This cycle has happened to me 3 times now. Seems like this is a common enough problem that finding suggestions on Google was easy. I've tried them all and the verdict is that it is a faulty battery sensor. I would return this phone if my previous phone was still somewhat usable, but it is not.In addition, I'm leaving for a 3 week trip next week and need a phone. I can't box it up and send it back.If the seller is listening, do you have a quick fix for this? If it wasn't for the faulty battery sensor, I would give this a 5 star. For the great bargain i got, I am happy with the phone. Battery life is good, seems to about 32 hours, but not knowing what battery is left is risky.

Nice phone but be cautious.,Bought a S9 Plus and the phone worked great for months. Sadly the phone I bought was still being paid for by the last owner and now its bricked.

I just received my Samsung S9+ and it looks practically brand new (I'm a nit picker). The base portion of the charger is from Samsung, but the USB cord is generic. Either way, the charging is not impacted. The phone charges relatively quick, the keys are responsive, the apps respond quickly, and when I input my SIMS card, voila, the phone works on an AT&amp;T device! I have no complaints thus far. I will review again in 30-days or less!</br>",2019年5月23日 在美国审核

It broke down just two weeks after the three month warranty expired.,"When I first took it to Verizon to get online, they had a big problem. The phone seemed to be an unpaid or stolen phone. However, the chip corresponded to a blue phone, not a purple one. They finally validated it because I gave proof I bought it refurbished from Amazon. After that, I was happy with the phone features. However, there was an extremely annoying app that kept popping up in the worse moments. It is called Bixby. It keeps popping into your life and asking you to set it. It bothers you all the time. It seems to be an application for you to talk to your phone. I don't want to talk to my phone or for my phone to talk to me. I am often in meetings or in places where a phone talking is an annoyance.So, I tried to eliminate the annoyance. However, Bixby cannot be deleted. Then, I though if I blocked every permission I could, I would stop it. Then, it started happening. The phone would go black and I could not control it. I learned that by pressing the right button and the low volume at the same time for 10 seconds, I got a microscopic menu that allowed to restart or to reset the phone to manufacturer settings (this, erases your memory. All of it, including your photos.)As days passed, the black screen became more frequent. It also happened every time I was in a phone call. This meant I could not use the number pad for options. Eventually, as I was trying to restart the phone, I accidentally reset it to default, loosing everything and having it as a new phone.The problem is that even now, it goes to black sometimes. Therefore, after less than 4 months, I have to replace the phone.It is not a good buy. And I am not getting another Galaxy after my experience with Bixby. They should eliminate it.",2020年9月1日 在美国审核

Have to be careful with renewed items,"The phone itself is nice and snappy. I am able to run all of my personal and work apps without any problems. My big issue is that when I start to use it for more than lite use the battery drains extremely quickly. I have days where I just check my email and Facebook and at the end of the day I will still have 60% battery left. I have other days where I will be looking solutions for a job I amworking on and I will go down from 90% to less than 40% in under an hour with just chrome use.

Inconvenient,"The phone came on time and was good until about 2 wks later it started SIM CARD FULL Delete items and after addressing this issue more than several times with the cellphone carrier they said it has to be the actual phone, I also have voicemail that stays as notification on the phone always even when I don't have any voicemails. So the carrier said it must be the phone, so unfortunately I had to go through that process just to find another one to buy, it was just inconvenient.",2019年12月21日 在美国审核

Great buy,"At first, I was hesitant to buy because of the reviews but I went ahead anyway.

My Verizon sim card works well with the phone,no problems with that.The battery life, on the other hand, could be better. After charging the phone completely it would lose battery life very quickly. The phone is good if your okay charging your phone multiple times a day.UPDATE:After buying a new charger the battery life has improved significantly.

"No fancy box, but this is a great deal.","Got this phone because my pixel3 was not at all what I had hoped for and was having terrible call quality issues amongst other things.This phone is a HUGE step up from my pixel3.The screen is gorgeous, call quality is miles better, the battery lasts, the camera is almost just as good (which means it's pretty good) and most of all it came in almost perfect condition even though it was a ""refurbished"" phone.The only cons about this purchase I can think of are:- There was a very small notch- like scratch on the screen in the top right corner which is only noticeable under certain light, or when the phone is off.- The phone came unlocked, but was originally an ATT phone, so it still had the ATT logo and bloatware apps.When I plugged my Google Fi sim card, it worked instantly but could not get the latest software updates (Android Pie).*Be aware that ATT blocks updates on their phones if someone uses a non-ATT sim card in an ATT device EVEN IF IT'S UNLOCKED*To get the latest updates, there are plenty of forums online that show you how to switch the ATT version of android to the unlocked version of android which allows you to get the OTA updates and Android Pie.To summarize, this is a great value for something that is still going to compete in the market for the next few years as a top device.It actually has more RAM than the pixel3 even though it is a generation older.Just make sure that when you order it refurbished from Amazon that you understand exactly what you are getting.No fancy box, no extra accessories, just a solid device.",2019年6月14日 在美国审核

Great condition with some minor issues.,"When I got this phone, it was in great condition. I’d say 9.5/10. The reason it’s not a perfect 10 is because the fingerprint scanner was partially scratched off and that made it difficult for me to register my fingerprint. While trying to register it tho, the rest of the scanner peeled off and it worked. Also, the phone also has some screen burn where the keypad usually pops up (see picture uploaded) but that doesn’t affect the functionality of the phone. Overall, it’s not a bad buy.",2021年7月29日 在美国审核

"Useless, doesn't accept sim cards. If you want to use off wifi, don't buy!!! Please read my review.","I purchased this phone along with all the accessories in the picture. On these things alone I have spent about $700. When the phone arrived it would not accept my SIM card. I went to Metro PCS thinking that they could give me a new SIM card and it would work. I spent about 4 hours in the MetroPCS store only to find out that there was no way for them to fix it changing to a T-Mobile SIM card did not help, and nor did using an AT&amp;T SIM card. I looked at the IMEI and saw that it was linked to Sprint which is now T-Mobile. So I went to T-Mobile to see if it would work with a T-Mobile SIM card or if they could fix whatever issue there was with it. I spent almost my entire day yesterday in the T-Mobile store. The person there insisted it was originally with that network it should work with one of those SIM cards. So I went through the hassle of switching my provider from MetroPCS to T-Mobile. In order to do that I have to buy my daughter a new phone and pay another $100 in some type of fees. At any rate, when I left the store it still wasn't working. Luckily I made it out with enough time to make it to MetroPCS. By the time we left there and switched my service back over left it was about 8:30 they were helping me after the store closed because they were so desperate to get a resolution due to the situation. Then in order to switch the lines back I had to pay close to $100 in fees. At this point I'm so frustrated that no one from Amazon customer service for their certified devices has called me back. In the box that the phone was shipped in it clearly states if there are any problems that arise to call them them first. I left over 6 messages with them and no one has ever called me back. When you call the number it goes directly to voicemail. Also when I reached out to the seller I asked him for replacement and all he said was to ship the device back. Does that mean they are replacing it?? I am still unsure about that and still without a phone irregardless of how much money I spent or time I've invested to make this work. This is the worst customer service I have ever gotten from any company there is no excuse for the things that have happened with this.",2020年8月4日 在美国审核

I expect a refurbished phone to be essentially like new as far as screen burn in goes, I thought that's what refurbished was all about, fixing any major flaws in the phone. I have never ordered from this company before, so there's no guarantee yours will come with burn in, but just know its a possibility.<br><br>To the sellers credit, they very quickly approved the return and I had no problems with that, I just think they need to repair a screen if it has obvious burn in, its a glaring issue that makes using the phone unpleasant, especially for someone with ocd like me.</br></br>",2021年10月7日 在美国审核

Prices are 20 - 70$ cheaper and the items are new or open box.Would avoid the uncertainty if my phone gets locked by RAC down the road ...Original review:Before my purchase, i read the reviews posted here so far. Some of my experiences were similar to what people wrote so far. Here my review:The shipping speed was very fast. Packaging was sufficient.On unboxing, the phone showed visible wear on the back, but the screen is scratch free and looks like it was replaced.When switching on the phone, it comes like new so it had to be configured. Once that was done, i transferred the data from my old Android phone seamlessly using the Google transfer services.Then the interesting things started: I configured my apps and realized that the fingerprint reader was not working. In addition, the Samsung security app claimed that the phone was rooted. Hence, it would not work.After some investigation, i found out that the ROM is Android 8. Trying to update to it to version 10 using the Android process build into the phone was not successful.So i tried to update the phone to Android 10 myself which did not work because of lack of skill on my part loli took it to a local shop. They checked the phone and initially stated that the ROM is actually Chinese with English language and that the phone is the international version. However, they told me it can be flashed to Android 10 US version. Said and done and 1 hour later the phone was on Android 10.When the technician turned it on for the first boot after flashing, the picture attached to this review showed up. Rent-A-Center !!! We directly thought that the phone is locked after flashing because Rent-A-Center seemed to have remote access to the phone.However, after further investigation, the phone works fine and the RAC notification never showed up again.The fingerprint reader is now working as well. I don't know if RAC still owns this phone or if they will lock it down the road but for now it seems to work fine.Summary: i wish the vendor would have used the correct ROM right away because that would have saved me 50$ for the flashing.Also, i recommend for the vendor to mention the origin of the phone and what kind of version is sold, e.g. US, Chinese, LATAM, Rent-A-Center, etc. That helps to inform the decision process for the customer to buy or pass on the item and saves potentially a lot of headache for both sides. Without mentioning this information clearly in the Amazon item description, customer potentially get suspicious and feel they were deceived which leads to bad and negative reviews.I am happy with my purchase but cannot give a buy recommendation.",2020年7月8日 在美国审核

Swing and a miss,"I have had this phone about a month now to replace LG I have been using for a couple years.I do a lot of multi-tasking on my phones and set them up for fastest processing while conserving battery life.There are ALOT of ""Samsung specific"" apps on this phone. I have yet to go through all of them, and have yet to find an efficient way to disable the ones I don't want. I am also completely annoyed by the number of different features that ultimately require you to download a chain of apps in order to utilize.Basically,it seems like my options are to have 100 apps installed and running on your phone just to operate, or 80 poorly running apps and an incredible amount of settings and options to refuse and avoid while using it day to day.I realize I'm new to Samsung' s products, and hopeful that I just haven't found they balance I'm looking for with it.Battery life is a complete disappointment.

You don't want this phone!,"I received a phone that is under a lease from a prior owner. This phone worked wonderfully until the phones lease expired.Now the phone displays a message every 15 minutes telling me that my lease is expired and I need to pay the balance. This message is for the prior owner of course. So whether I'm trying to capture a precious moment with my camera on my phone or send someone a text, I'm interrupted every 15 minutes by this message. I must back arrow to go out of the message so I can continue using my phone. It's ridiculous and inconvenient. I'm interrupted daily approximately 50 times by this message. I cannot turn off the message. Sprint, the prior owner of the phone claims they cannot turn off the notice because it is no longer their property. My current mobile device company is T-Mobile, and they cannot help me either. I asked Amazon to help me, and they said they cannot help me because it was sold to me by a third-party company. So here I am stuck with a phone that continues to send me annoying and reoccurring messages that my lease is up when I don't have a lease. I requested help from the seller but they won't acknowledge my request because its out of their return window. I've written them several times through Amazon and on my own and they will not help me.",2020年12月19日 在美国审核

I've got to say it's really good and nice especially for the price but the side issue is a deal breaker for me sadly because of the games that I play, do rely heavily on the left edge of the screen.

Stay far away. 90 day warranty does not apply to seller. Only Amazon if you're ok with waiting.,"Initially I wrote a good review. And it's hard to get anything but a 5 star. But after a month the phone screen started glitching. It then went blank. I gave a heads up it was defective and asked for a replacement. They said they don't replace so send back for a refund. After I send it back they a million excuses to why not give me a refund. First said I sent the wrong phone,then I sent the wrong charger, then I didn't wrap it good enough in the package, then the screen was cracked. They said they'll just send it back to me. I went back and forth and they assumed I dropped it. Even though I had a case and screen protector from day one. They then said it's obvious that it was dropped because it's dropped. I have an s7 with many cracks and the phone never went blank. Now they basically say it's my fault no matter what. He said straight up the answer it's always because the phone was dropped and that all parts are original so it can't be defective. He said they receive it from carrier basically new and they don't renew the parts, but the description says renewed. So they doing whatever it takes to not refund. I inquired to Amazon and Amazon said it will take up to 2 weeks to refund. Please stay away at your own risk because if it's defective it's your fault no matter what.",2020年5月9日 在美国审核

Don't Buy - Poor Quality Inspection at Your Expense,"I have purchased many cell phones in the last 30 years.This was the first, and the last, ""refurbished"" phone I purchased. The Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus was purchased as a gift.

I found it couldn't send MMS messages while on WiFi and it also had a SPRINT notification at the top that would not go away regarding activation.After hours of troubleshooting and reading that using a Sprint unlocked phone on an AT&amp;T Network I may never be able to send or receive picture messages normally I decided to send it back being such a big investment. So long story short my phone was clearly not completely unlocked, it was a previous sprint carried phone but came with a paper stating it was previously Verizon.....",2018年10月20日 在美国审核

This is absolutely a scam as its advertised as renewed/refurbished(like new) not used an with imperfections and flaws. So buyers beware of purchasing from this seller.,2021年3月23日 在美国审核

Carrier-locked.  Don't buy!,"""Amazon Renewed"" - yeah, right.These aren't from Amazon, people.This is a company in the Bronx, probably a pawn shop.First Galaxy S9+ they sent was carrier-locked.Second one they sent was also carrier-locked.Carrier-locked means the previous owner didn't finish their contract with a cell provider and the previous owner just sold the phone to these people to get cash.Or it was stolen. The cell provider wants their money and refuses to unlock the phone until they get it.So they're expensive paperweights that keep getting flown back and forth to these guys in the Bronx as people purchase them over and over but can't use them.",2020年9月17日 在美国审核

Phone is not as described.,The phone seems to work fine but it is NOT factory unlocked.These phones were most likely traded to purchase another phone from amazon.

I've discussed this issue with AT&amp;T tech support.They say that the phone is already unlocked but the phone asks for a network key when you put in a non-AT&amp;T SIM card.

"Research who you buy from, if you can!","Purchased from CertifiedGadgets. Phone was delivered Feb 8th, which was a few days earlier, was very nervous because the reviews left by other people, but i think it all depends on who you buy from. Phone was originally at&amp;t (the logo appears on opening screen + bloatware). I took it to Metro by T-Mobile to have it swapped and it was a success. I have 4G, MMS messaging, and Location all work. The phone came with a charger, but I'm not certain if its the original one. Overall the purchase was a success. I'll update my review if anything happens but I'm being rather hope.Edit:Aside from the things listedbelow, the phone performed exceptionally well. It feels fast and smooth, ; Its probablythe fastest PhoneI've ever had: it gets a littlewarm when charging. Stock Calculator, Notes, and Music Player apps aren't preinstalled.Have to get some from the Playstore . . . An easy fix but was still inconveniencing The stock Texting app has missing settings, preventingthe sendingof emojis, so I had to downloada different texting app as my default. Edge Light doesn'twork when the screen is off like it's supposed to. Gimmicky but still would have preferredto have it. Phone rattles, like somethingin it could be loose?

Galaxy S9+,"My first time wih a refurbished phone and my wife and IareLoving it. We got the blue case per the wifes wishes and it arrived 3 days beforeit was scheduled to be here. Very happy about that. We needed to put on the liquid glass protection, so there was a little extra cost there. The phone looks like a new one and is very fast for 4G. I whole heartedly recommend this to everyone and my total cost is less than half of new! Order this phone and save some valuable cash.",2020年7月24日 在美国审核
"This is a World Device, works on GSM and CDMA. (Wouldn't gamble if you have Sprint)","The S9+ can be easily flashed to the 4 major networks but I wouldn't gamble with Sprint as I've heard rumors they will deactivate your sim in an unlocked device not purchased from them. Simply download the correct and up to date firmware and flash it with ODIN. Search Google. If you have no idea what I'm talking about then this isn't for the faint of heart. There are tutorials on youtube. Basically as long as the Samsung S9+ is already carrier unlocked. Even if it's from T-Mobile or Verizon, you can flash your carrier's version of the firmware. This will make the phone function as intended for that network. VOLTE, LTE, Visual voicemail will all work and on the correct bands. Be very careful because if you don't know what you're doing you could brick the device rendering it useless. The process takes about 20 minutes with your windows pc and ODIN doing all the work. FLASHING THE S9+ DOES NOT SIM UNLOCK. Let's say I have an AT&amp;T or Verizon S9+ and I want to switch to T-Mobile, by performing the flash it will install the T-Mobile firmware needed to make the phone run properly as if it was purchased from T-Mobile. I have not heard anything about it being illegal but if you are concerned about such a matter you should consult the laws in your state. Obviously you don't want to ask the carrier because they're not going to tell you the truth or even have a clue what you're talking about.",2019年4月27日 在美国审核

hate this curvy touch screen.,"In general it supposed to be very VERY good; yet, there's 1 ONE thing I hate it so much and timely I intentionally smashed it to the ground simply because it was TOO sensitive and went elsewhere when I left the phone in my pocket while listening to YouTube audio book.Luckily the phone's protection is pretty good.I'd rather go back to my old Moto 4 Plus if wasn't because of a much MUCH better camera that came with Samsung phones.

I'd give this piece of crap zero stars if I could,"Useless bixby function.<br>Terribly slow and extremely annoying auto on detection feature that would turn on the screen right after you press the power button which will then turn the screen off.Locked screen is useless when you just want to view the time or any notifications. When you press the on screen home button, all it gives you is authentication screen. If you want to see the time or notifications, you would have to press the power button. Very inconvenient.Randomly disables fingerprint and facial recognition and requires password to unlock. Extremely frustrating when you are in a hurry. Reminders take up the entire screen and don't allow you navigate to home screen unless you dismiss or snooze the reminder.</br>",2021年7月14日 在美国审核
Not All Phones Are Unlocked,"I bought two phones from this seller, the first one was amazing, good battery life, functional for what I needed, and fully unlocked.The second phone was a disaster, had to return it twice because both times it was locked to Virizon and it was a false advertising, would have given more stars had it not been for that, also the two week waiting period for a refund on the final return of the second phone was a real piss off, so got lucky once, then unlucky twice over.",2022年5月13日 在美国审核

BUT, after a while of using the battery was below 80% health, it was at 64% health. Went and got it replaced, costed me 60$. Still worth it for a phone this cheap and good! Definitely worth it! One more thing if you get AT&amp;T service, it may show T-mobile service but it still works with AT&amp;T. Battery life on heavy usage (gaming, YouTube) even with a new battery lasts about 3-4 hours, when lightly used it lasts 8-12 hours, and no usage it unknown.<br>Finger print, face recognition, and blood pressure/ heart rate sensor - finger print gave me trouble at first but once I found out you put your last knuckle join on the sensor, it worked great! Face recognition was easy to use and was quick to recognize your face! Blood pressure/ heart rate sensor is good takes a minute to read your heart rate.Camera quality, screen quality, and build in speaker quality- camera quality is good, does 4k rear photos and videos, and front camera is ok. The screen quality is great, you can watch certain YouTube videos in 2k 60 fps, has an oled screen (my favorite part). The speakers are really good! Loud and has a crisp sound, i have noticed it uses the calling speaker on the top screen is used as a regular speaker, so if you cover the bottom speakeryou don't miss a beat!Phones reaction speed, ram, storage, and heat test- the phone reaction is great, I haven't gotten a lag spike yet, and ram is great, I haven't gotten low yet even in heavy use!

Amazon did NOTHING to help me and were actually extremely rude and UNCARING about the issue.THE SELLER however, was very helpful after I contacted them through the Amazon website. They stated the phone had been sent to me from Amazon's own warehouse and therefore they had no control over the item delivered to me which makes sense to me as a business owner. They immediately offered to replace / Exchange the phone for me.

They were very helpful and provided excellent customer service unlike Amazon.I would definitely recommend buying from the seller EDGE CELLULAR however, would NOT recommend Amazon for obvious reasons.

Like the sensitive keyboard option I liked it helped but my s8+ just has a rigid operation making this s9+ feel well rounded .I have my doubts honestly .owning a s8+ for years its weakness and strength will be tested as the s8+ became much less vulnerable since the 2021 updates... just staying a step ahead!!!thanks fingerprint reader face recognition battery life,2021年2月6日 在美国审核

Like New means Like New!,"Wow, really impressed with my S9+ from this seller. This is the phone I have wanted ever since I saw that super slo-mo camera! I'm not too fussy about renewed electronics to be honest although I know it has its cons. I'm upgrading from an iPhone 5s. Now the S9+ (Renewed) arrived in great packaging, I received the phone and the charging cable but no adapter. This is fine as I knew this before purchasing. It came with a glass screen protector installed, finger prints were visible and I did notice just a few very very small micro scratches around the steel bezel however I could not have seen them if I weren't specifically looking for them. After wiping off the S9+ with a micro fibre cloth it looked prestine! I was very impressed by how clean and shiny my newly received S9+ was looking. The greatest thing there was no scratches on the screen or on the back glass. Iris scanner works, face ID works, camera omg so clean, blood pressure sensor works, call quality 10/10, finger print scanner super accurate. Came at about 42% battery i think....I've have it about a month now, charged it up. Upon starting the phone I was prompted to do the usual setup. Everything works perfect with my new phone. I am 110% happy with my S9+ from this seller. Would definitely do business again.",2021年12月27日 在美国审核

Brand new no scratches or dings,"I was very worried to buy a renewed phone for my wife as she is very very picky after doing research and looking at the Samsung s10 which is less of a phone than the s9plus I found this seller. I bought the lilac purple one it was sent very quickly in the mail and when I opened it it was flawless no scratches dings nicks nothing everything works everything the battery lasts all day and with heavy use about 8 hours . This phone feels premium stellar amazing . One tip if you switch over the Sim card and ur text messages go to ur old phone or one person cant get a text through each of you delete the old convoreations you had on every phone and delete and rename your contact for that person the text isn't coming through .. My wife couldn't recieve my text the night of her birthday and dissapointed her about the phone the next day I realized my and her phone has verified phone numbers which was blocking the ability to send the text what a pain but I figured it out and she absolutely loves her phone .. Make sure you get screen protectors and turn on screen protector mode on ur s9plus and get a carry case that is good , this phone has a glass front and glass back very expensive to replace a lot more than just buying the protrctors:)",2021年9月27日 在美国审核

Faulty phone - refund issued,"The product was defective from the start. It won't consistently charge. Frankly, I am surprised that this used phone was cleared for resale.The S9+ arrived with a little over 20% on the battery (""red flag"") and then was always very finicky about charging(""check connection"" error). The charge light would often turn off seconds after it was plugged in. I managed to get the phone fully charged overnight the first few days and then it became increasingly difficult to charge the phone anytime.One concern about returning the phone: CellTraders requires that the buyer remove old Google and Samsung accounts before returning the phone or the buyer is charged a ""restocking fee"". That is a big ask for a defective phone which will not charge. I managed to do this in stages over several days and am hoping there will be no issues.On the positive side, the phone did come professionally wrapped in plastic. It appears that CellTraders does care about its products. However, a nicely wrapped lemon is still a lemon.So far as the S9+ goes: I loved using it for the three days it worked. It had a clear screen nice features, good solid feel (weight) in the hand. I will be getting another one but will probably buy new from somewhere.If all goes well with the return, I will let the readers know. Perhaps selling this defective phone is a one-off for CellTraders. For now, I have to say be cautions about purchasing used phones from CellTraders.UPDATE 3/1/2021 - The phone was received and a full refund was prompted issued. CellTraders appears to be a solid business. I am only sorry that the S9+ didn't work.",2021年2月11日 在美国审核

It has now decided that when you press the unlock screen button the entire screen is green and you can't use anything.

Badly refurbished...,"I bought this phone6 month ago and since then I encountered many problems that are clearly coming from a poor refurbushing...- After 2 days, the Rear Camera Glass Lens broke, although the phone did not receive any impact- After two months, the screen stopped working, so I had to get the phone repaired, and it turned out the screen flat connection was disconnected because one piece was missing, the one that maintains it together once the phone is fully assembled.- After 2 months, I found out that I was not receiving most of the calls people were trying to make, the antenna seems to be not working 80% of the time....Now I have a useless 500$ phone because the replacement parts used when it got refurbished were of poor quality, or even missing...

Battery life has been fairly good as well and the phone operates very smoothly. The only caveat is that the screen brightness doesn't go too high and can be quite dark outdoors even in the highest setting. The other consideration is that I cannot update it to Android 10 despite it being compatible for ugrade , most likely due to being a US version although I don't really know for sure.

4 weeks later,"Its not as great as previously stated. It drains battery (lasts up to maybe 2-3 hours) without doing anything other than check emails and use whatsapp which is worse than my J5 from 2016. The seller advertised it as having 128g worth of internal storage but it only has 64gigs, the big selling point for me was a good camera (which it has), a better battery life than what I had and internal storage so its a bit of a let down, the seller advertised the phone as being in excellent condition which is not the case, the exterior is great and looks good as new, there are no OS issues but the battery life is just really bad and the storage space was misrepresented. I assumed any issues it has would be disclosed since it is a refurbished phone if I knew about the battery life before hand I would not have bought it.",2018年12月18日 在英国审核

I was very surprised bacause all I know I have an unlocked phone.I wish the seller have given this information, if this is normal to Samsung well I did not know,I’m sure many doesn’t either.The phone is great but it has its restriction, and I defeats the purpose of having and UNLOCKED PHONE.If you don’t travel to other region (outside Europe) this is good for you but if you do be prepare for the hassle.",2019年1月23日 在英国审核

I have been able to load many useful apps,set up all the links via wi-fi and bluetooth I require and link my e-mails via Gmail.

The phone itself was still covered in the protective plastic film. It's a new phone so no worries there.After starting the phone for the first time the language was Italian, but it was prompting for the setup language. Just change it to English GB, follow the setup procedure and, when complete, the phone is a U.K. spec. device.I left the phone on and, during the course of the day, it was downloading updates, including two updates to Android 8. I assume it'll upgrade to Android 9 when Samsung is ready.Overall I'm very satisfied, especially at the price.UPDATEThere appears to be some confusion about the exact model.

Ok phone but changing from iPhone is a challenge.,"The phone is Ok even though the iPhone %s feels much more like a premium product, mainly due to its aluminum body. Changing from IOS - which is far more polished and intuitive - to Android is a real challenge. Took me an entire weekend to""understand"" how it works and I still don't find it as user friendly and intuitive as IOS is. Will probably change back again. Kies software to sync etc is also very basic. Not even 10% of the option iTunes offers. You also need to be careful on the inbuilt ""google spying"" in any Android phone. There are many hidden settings which you need to turn off or ""opt out"".

Never buy from this Seller,"I was duped on this deal. The phone was supposed to be 4G unlocked. First it did not work out of the box, next the seller refused to take it back without restocking fee and me paying for return shipment. AT&amp;T said that it was not unlocked properly and certainly not done by Samsung but was done (attempted) probably by the Seller after importing it into US (evidenced by the pins of the wall charger) which already voided the OEM warranty.So instead of incurring the restocking fee and return postage I took to a local guy who did the unlock but regardless he said this will not run on USA 4G network unless unlocked properly by Samsung. So I am stuck with a 4G capable phone working on HSPA+. My recommendation, do not buy an unlocked phone unless it is factory unlocked by Samsung.",2014年7月11日 在美国审核
A great all-around flagship with unmatched functionality,"A great flagship...light, thin, awesome screen, long battery life and stylish (if you haven't held one, you won't understand).Throw in water and dust proofing, removable battery and micro SD memory card dock, and you've got an unmatched phone.If you want an all-metal phone without a removable back, battery and micro SD card, great - but these are practical features that many appreciate.The S5 is incredibly light and thin, even svelte - and the plastic is subtle, stylish and TOUGH (won't bend in your pocket).This phone easily goes 24 hours on one charge (with power to spare).Wireless charging is VERY CONVENIENT.Regarding Touch Wiz, it's been refined in the S5 (and will undoubtedly improve with Lollipop) and overall, Android simply provides more robust features/customization.iOS is also a good OS - a simpler interpretation of an OS, but again, many appreciate Android's flexibility.For me, it comes down to functionality and the S5 is excellent in this regard.Personally, I think a 5.1 inch screen is optimal - bigger and better than 4.7 and you can still use it with one hand.Can I say that NFC and IR are great - my Galaxy is an all-in-one remote for my TV, cable box, DVR and DVD player.In terms of apps, Android has everything you need.Interesting that most of the top 10 apps in iOS are Google apps (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Search, etc.)",2014年12月23日 在美国审核
Works on T-Mobile U.S.A (in depth network/phone review),"Works with T-Mobile U.S.A I live near Seattle WA, unfortunately there is no 4G or LTE connection that is establishable and I get 3G and a very good HSPA+ connection with average Download speed of 22mbps and upload of 7mbps on 3G. 29mbps download and 11 uplaod on HSPA+. I have a Galaxy S3 LTE (T999L) version for T-mobile as well and I get 35mbps download and 15 upload on T-moblies 4G LTE network.There is not a big gap at all between the different network speeds, call quality and text messaging is liquid smooth, no complaints there. If your a big network buff then this shouldn't be a huge deal because I also did some testing with my Galaxy S3 and this Galaxy S5 side by side and the speed difference is usually a 1-2 second delay. The place where 4G and LTE outperform is when downloading and uploading big files, not small files like updates from the playstore etc. My advise is not to buy this phone based on network, rather on the phone itself, it is a amazing device and I highly recommend it to friends. Don't let things like network speeds that load your webpages 1 second slower get in the way from the amazing user experience that the phone itself has to offer. If you really want a good stable connection then switch to WiFi this phone has a killer network connection to Wifi it's super fast and very stable, mobile networks too. So whoever may be reading this review this is a fantastic phone the best i've had the privilege of having it works on T-mobile U.S.A and there is no noticeable network difference from a pure T-mobile device. So if you want a Galaxy S5 then i highly recommend this one because if you don't live in the U.S. then you may have 4G LTE. I have no complaints at all hands down best phone out there. I hope this helped anybody, and helps with your purchasing decision.",2014年8月29日 在美国审核

If you are buying this for use in any country ...,"If you are buying this for use in any country except the UK then be aware that warranty repairs are a total pain.This model is from the UK.We bought one and had a problem with the screen (vertical lines running through it).Samsung US won't fix it as they claim to use a different firmware load so we have to send it to the UK.Samsung UK won't accept it directly from the US (customs issues?) so we have to ship it to a friend in the UK ($35 each way for shipping and customs) who ships it to Samsung UK who repairs it under warranty who ships it back to our UK friend who ships it back to us.Once we get it back it will be a tough decision as to whether we keep it or sell it.UPDATE: We received the phone back from Samsung in the UK with a letter that reads: ""Thank you for sending your mobile phone to us. James, one of our engineers at our approved service centre, has tested your phone and they have found that it is not working because your handset has been found to be of non European origin.Samsung products are covered by a regional warranty and therefore only protected by the warranty specific to that region.Our records indicate that your handset (Samsung SM-G900F (GS5) 16GB white) was originally manufactured and shipped outside of Europe and is therefore not covered by the European warranty.We would recommend that you contact your supplier from where you had purchased your handset to discuss the matter further.Kind regards, Samsung Electronics UK.So, despite giving the UK service center my phone's model number, IMEI and serial number BEFORE I sent it on a lovely journey to the UK and back, they returned it and denied that it was of European origin.I have spent countless hours with Samsung UK and US and neither can help me figure out exactly who will fix this problem under warranty.I bought it from a private party who purchased it from Amazon so my next call will be to Amazon to see if they can somehow help me.",2014年7月23日 在美国审核
Great Phone overall,"Great Phone overall . 3 things I don' like: the camera takes a little bit too long to open up. The multitasking(switching from One app to another is a little slow.)

A Samsung Evolution,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT &amp; SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the ""natural"" setting, as the ""vivid"" and even ""standard"" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the ""back"" and ""menu"" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59"" x 2.85"" x 0.32""(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury ""F"" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and ""Google Street View"" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.",2014年4月7日 在美国审核

Hate it!,"Hate it! Hate it! Hate it!!!!!What a stupid design! My galaxy S5 has enough useless features to fill days of exploration yet the home button wakes the phone and there's no way to disable this feature. Every time the phone is in my pocket, the home button inadvertently depresses and wake the phone. Soon after the phone rub against my pants and get unlocked. From there to the misdeal phone numbers to the deletion of important info, the way is very short. I guess it's okay, it only cost $700...I contacted Samsung but they had no help to offer other that going around it by putting a number or pattern lock on the phone. Surly my pants pocket isn't that smart. It's okay for the phone to heat up in my pants and waste battery while the screen is on.Arrgggghhhhhh! you stupid Samsung software engineers! Who the hell is testing your prototypes? We don't all wear suits like you! most of us are a blue collar working class that put our phone in our pants pocket.Please revise software to allow us to disable home button from waking phone up.And NO! I don't wan't to put a code (number, pattern, or unreliable finger print) on my phone. I don't want to see my life waste away on unlocking my phone for every time the screen goes out or with every phone call. I tried it and it suck.If this is not fixed, this is my last Samsung product.

Sollte Samsung, auch bei den nächsten Modellen nur festverbauten Akku und Speicher anbieten, wird das S5 sicherlich das letzte Smartphone sein das ich von Samsung gekauft habe.Das S5 ist ein hervorragendes Handy, schnell und ohne Softwarefehler.

Vom Z1 zum S5,"Ich habe meiner Frau mein Z1 überlassen, und nachdem sie anfänglich herzlichst über die Größe gelästert hat wollte sie es nicht mehr hergeben. Leider zeigte das Z1 in den letzten Monaten immer öfter Ausfallerscheinungen (Kamera-Bug und eine ""selbstständige"" Tatstatur) und nun wollte sie doch ein neues. Da ich ein Note 4 habe konnte ich sie davon überzeugen Samsung ins Auge zu fassen.Besonders wichtig sind ihr die Kamera, die Displaydiagonale (ach, auf einmal ;-)), die Verarbeitung und die Musikwiedergabe, auch über das Autoradio. Sony wollte sie nicht mehr, auch wenn sie gerade von der Verarbeitung des Z1 sehr begeistert war.Erst wollte sie dann das S4 kaufen, aber weil das noch ziemlich rundlich war haben wir uns doch für das S5 entschieden. Die Ecken sind zwar abgerundet, aber gesamt ist das Handy wenigstens rechteckig.Die Einrichtung klappte sehr schnell und in dem Punkt war meine Frau auch begeistert. Von der Verarbeitung her war sie aber noch skeptisch, aber ok, wenn man von einem Z1, das aus Glas und Metall besteht, auf ein Plastikhandy umsteigt kommt dieser Vergleich unweigerlich. Aber mittlerweile findet sie auch das S5 gut verarbeitet, es könnte halt nur etwas schwerer sein. Und auf dem oberen Lautsprecher befinden sich ganz links etwas Klebereste, mir wäre es vermutlich kaum aufgefallen, ihr schon.Nun ein bisschen zu den technischen Details, das S5 läuft absolut flüssig, Apps werden sofort geöffnet, ohne Denkpause oder sonstige Ruckler.Die Kamera war ja sehr wichtig, wo anfangs noch etwas Ernüchterung herrschte wurde schnell auch Zufriedenheit draus nach dem sie etwas damit rumspielte. Die Kamera kommt zwar nicht zu 100% an die des Z1 heran, aber sie macht dennoch sehr gute Bilder.Autofokus und Auslöser sind recht fix, wenn es etwas dunkler ist dauert es entsprechend etwas länger. Auch gut, Fotos werden automatisch auf die Micro-SD abgelegt sofern eine eingelegt ist. Zur Micro-SD, diese hat sie schon etwas länger wurde aber anstandlos vom S5 erkannt.Die Einstellungen lassen sich gut erreichen und hier lässt sich auch so einiges konfigurieren, u.a. die Vibrationsstärke, Tastentöne usw.Das Display ist sehr knackig, Farben werden sehr scharf dargestellt. Die Helligkeit lässt sich natürlich automatisch einstellen, das hat meine Frau aber direkt abgeschaltet und die Helligkeit manuell eingestellt.Auch sehr wichtig, die Blickwinkelstabilität! Und die ist hier gegeben!Der Akku liegt momentan bei einem Tag, wird sich aber bekanntermaßen einpendeln.Alles in allem ist sie zufrieden mit dem Handy und würde es auch wieder kaufen. Wenn ihr Fragen habt könnt ihr gerne die Kommentarfunktion nutzen. Ansonsten hoffe ich das ich euch klein wenig behilflich sein konnte.",2014年12月21日 在德国审核

Top Handy das beste am markt,"hatte ja das s4 und das war schon top,über die Verarbeitung kann ich wie eben immer berichtet wird vom s4 nur sagen das es echt gut verarbeitet ist, nicht so wie die meisten eben sagen, beim s5 finde ich nicht schlechter oder besser, liegt auch nicht wirklich besser in der Hand wie das s4. Aus den Händen fallen kann es leicht darum unbedingt hülle, wegen zerkratzen von Rahmen.zum Handy: mit Sicherheit das beste was man am Markt bekommt, Preis 550 euro ist ja teuer aber das s4 kostete auch 500 euroDas Amoled Display überzeugt auch diesmal wieder und ist noch heller wie beim s4.Und das beste was man am Handymarkt findet, kein htc oder lg kann da mithalten, auch das i Phon nicht.auch überzeugt hat die Kamera,die noch bessere Bilder liefert.Fingerprint okay wers braucht gut, einige neue sachen sind dazu gekommen,eben für Technik freaks.Habe auch noch htc one getestet, lg, und Sony, ja Verarbeitung ist hier etwas besser, kompakter aber eben nur darum weil man hier keine Abdeckung abmachen kann, keinen Akkuwechsel und keine Speicher slot hat, ich wills nicht, brauche diese beiden sachen, akku wird mit der Zeit schlecht oder Kaput, Wer viel Bilder macht oder Musik am Handy abspielt der braucht eine Speicherkarte.Fazit: gegenüber den Mitbewerber, überzeugt hat das bessere Amoled Display, Speicher Slot und Akku austauschbar, schnell im Internet und einige andere featchers. Da kann kein andereres Smartphonemithalten. Wer das s4 noch hat und weis nicht ob er auf das s5 umsteigen soll, würde ich sagen wer das Geld hat ja, aber der große unterschied ist hier vom s4 auf s5 nicht.

Super Smartphone von Apple zu Android,"Vorab muss ich sagen dass ich bis Samstag ein reiner Apple Jünger war. Habe ein Macbook, Ipad und nen Iphone. Hatte vor 2 Jahren schonmal das Galaxy S3 ausprobiert. Dies hat mir gar nicht gefallen. Beim Galaxy S5 bin ich total begeistert. Der Umstieg ist überhaupt nicht schwer gefallen. Ich musste nur 2 Apps kaufen weil ich die synchronisation meiner Termine und Notizen nicht missen wollte. Bisher konnte ich keinen Nachteil zum Iphone feststellen. Das Galaxy arbeitet viel flüssiger als das Iphone 5c. Das einzigste Manko bis jetzt ist das Navigieren. Habe in meinem Golf VII eine FSE und bei Iphone wird bei einer Navi Ansage ein Anruf simuliert währen man Radio hört. Dies geht hier nicht. Man muss die Musik über Bluetooth hören, damit man eine Navi Ansage auf den Lautsprechern hat. Etwas unbefriedigent, deshalb nur 4****.",2014年7月28日 在德国审核
"Stark angefangen, stärker nachgelassen","Ich besitze mein Samsung Galaxy S5 nun seit etwas über 2 Jahren und war zu Beginn mehr als zufrieden. Das Smartphone reagierte schnell und lief sehr flüssig, die Kamera machte gute bis sehr gute Bilder und der Akku hielt bei starker Nutzung locker einen ganzen Tag durch. Leider dauerte es nicht lange, bis die Akkuleistung stark nachließ, was sich leider auch nach einem Tausch des Akkus nicht besserte. Da das Problem kurz nach einem Systemupdate auftrat gehe ich davon aus, dass das Problem in der Software liegt. Mittlerweile muss ich das Handy bei geringer bis normaler Nutzung mindestens zweimal am Tag laden, und zwar unabhängig von dem verwendeten Akku. Die Kamera macht insofern Probleme, dass sie oft nicht auslöst oder das Bild nicht speichert obwohl mehr als genügend Speicherplatz frei ist. Es reagiert in der Regel noch immer sehr schnell und bleibt nur selten hängen, schaltet sich jedoch des Öfteren von alleine ab um danach sofort wieder neu zu starten, gerne auch während des telefonierens. Wenn das Smartphone kalt ist und der Bildschirm reativ dunkel eingestellt ist, beginnt das untere Drittel des Bildschirms grün zu flackern bzw. es entstehen auch dann grüne Streifen beim an- und ausschalten des Bildschirms, wenn die Helligkeit relativ hoch eingestellt ist. Sobald das Handy warm ist und/oder der Bildschirm heller eingestellt ist verschwindet das grüne Flackern und der Bildschirm flackert hell/dunkel, was allerdings auch nicht weniger nervig ist.Beim Versuch zu telefonieren reagierte das Smartphone zunächst nicht, nach einigen Minuten wählte es die Nummer dann quasi von alleine. Dummerweise startete es sich dann genau in dem Moment neu, als die Verbindung aufgestellt wurde.Zudem stürzen etliche installierte Apps, aber auch vorinstallierte Anwendungen wie etwa das Einstellungsmenü andauernd ab und seitdem nach einem ungewollten Neustart des Handys die Schnelleinstellungen im Benachrichtigungsfeld verschwunden sind ist es theoretisch noch möglich, in den Einstellungen diese wieder zu aktivieren, praktisch reagiert das Handy darauf allerdings nicht.Da bei meinem vorherigen Smartphone, ebenfalls ein Samsung, die gleichen Probleme auftraten, werde ich mich wohl in der nächsten Zeit nach einem Smartphone einer anderen Marke umsehen.",2016年12月18日 在德国审核
Montagsgerät,"Nach Kauf stellte ich fest, dass auf dem Backcover der Neugeräts ein Buchstabe vom Namen Samsung fehlte. Amazon erwies sich als recht großzügig und erstattete mir einen gewissen Betrag, von dem ich ein neues Cover kaufen konnte. Nun nach nur 6 Wochen ist der Akku defekt. Das darf nach so kurzer Zeit noch nicht passieren. Ich hatte schon einige Samsung Handys und war mit den Geräten zufrieden, was ich gegenwärtig nicht von diesem Gerät sagen kann. zu guter letzt viel noch auf, dass das Display sich leicht im oberen Bereich ablöste. Ich habe das zwar andrücken können, aber nach einiger Zeit konnte man sehen, dass das Display sich wieder etwas gelöste hatte. Aktuell ist das Gerät zur Reparatur, weil Amazon darauf bestand, dass ich das ganze Gerät an den Subunternehmer, der im Auftrag von Amazon die Geräte repariert schicken soll. Dort liegt es jetzt schon gut 1 Woche und ich habe noch keine weitere Info.

Eine Katastophe!!!!,"Freudig erwartete ich mein eigenes neues Samsung Galaxy S5 Handy. Beim Erststart wurde ich mit asiatischen Schriftzeichen begrüßt und es hatte Probleme beim Aufladen. Somit reklamierte ich das Handy und bekam ein Ersatz. Das zweite Handy ließ sich gut starten. Nachdem ich erneut alles eingerichtet hatte, konnte mein Nutzungsvergnügen nun losgehen - so dachte ich. Schnell bemerkte ich, der Empfang beim Telefonieren sowohl auch der Internetempfang, trotz D1 Netz, waren eine Katastrophe. Ich hatte einen guten Vergleich, vor dem hier erworbenen Handy hatte ich bereits das Samsung S4 und war Stolz, über den hervorragenden Empfang meines D1 Netzes. Nun zeigte sich ein schwacher E Empfang bis hin zu gar keinem Netzempfang. Auch beim Telefonieren hatte ich oft keinen Empfang und wenn doch, war das telefonieren für meine Gesprächspartner kein Vergnügen. Oft wurde ich nicht verstanden. Ich war total abgenervt. Nach einem Jahr nun habe ich mich entschlossen ein neues Samsunghandy von meinem Netzanbieter zu nehmen und kann nur eines sagen: Puh - nach einem Jahr Katastrophenhandy bin ich nun aus der Steinzeit wieder in der Neuzeit angekommen.

USB-Ladebuchse defekt nach ca. 6 Monaten Nutzung,"Ich habe mir Mitte 2016 ein neues S5 gekauft. Anfänglich auch sehr zufrieden. Habe es stets sorgsam behandelt und rein äußerlich sieht es wie neu aus. Habe mir dafür ab dem ersten Tag Nutzung eine Hülle sowie eine Panzerglasfolie für das Display gekauft und verwendet.Im täglichen Gebrauch ist es erforderlich das Smartphone regelmäßig zu laden. Ich habe es dafür für gewöhnlich über nachts geladen. Sprich einmal täglich es über USB geladen. Nach nun ca. 180-200 maligem Laden ließ sich das USB Kabel nicht mehr in die Ladebuchse einführen. Es scheint ein mechanischer Defekt eingetreten zu sein. Wie es dazu tatsächlich gekommen ist, kann ich nicht wirklich nachvollziehen. Bei der Verwendung war ich stets achtsam und habe keine Gewalt angewendet.Habe das S5 daraufhin eingeschickt, was über Amazon unkompliziert möglich war. Nun habe ich jedoch vom Dienstleister die Nachricht, dass das S5 defekt ist und unterbreitet mir einen Kostenvoranschlag von ca. 140 EUR. Bei einem Neugerätepreis von ca. 330 EUR finde ich dies unverhältnismäßig teuer. Bei einer kurzen Recherche im Internet wird einem auch deutlich, warum dies ist ... ein unkomplizierter Austausch der Ladebuchse ist leider nicht möglich. Dafür muss mehr oder minder das komplette S5 auseinander gebaut werden mit entsprechenden Gefahren weiterer Beschädigungen.Ich habe zwar noch ein paar Tage Zeit über diesen Kostenvorschlag nachzudenken oder selbst die Reparatur zu versuchen, aber ehrlich gesagt bin ich von der Qualtität des S5 enttäuscht. Nach einem halben Jahr Nutzung ein mechanischer Defekt an der Ladebuchse ist für mich sehr enttäuschend.

Pessimo servizio,"Le due stelle sono per il venditore non per l'apparecchio.Ho fatto l'ordine il 22 settembre. La data di spedizione era indicata il 25 settembre. La data di consegna era stabilita 29-30 settembre. Visto il prezzo (il 22 settembre) decido di comprarlo. Si trattava del regalo di compleanno per mia nipote (che li compie il 30 settembre).Per farla breve l'S5 è arrivato il 2 ottobre.Ma solo perchè ho dovuto minacciare più volte il venditore di disdire l'ordine. Se non lo avessi fatto, probabilmente starei ancora aspettando lo smartphone.Durante i vari messaggi ho chieste diverse informazioni (come disdire l'ordine, tempi di riaccredito soldi, ecc.) ma nessuna risposta in merito salvo dire che la data di consegna sarebbe stata rispettata.Da notare che il testo dei loro messaggi era in un italiano incerto. Ho pensato: sono tedeschi. Va più che bene. Si fanno almeno capire.Nel frattempo dalla data dell'ordine, l'S5 da loro venduto cala di prezzo due volte. Avevo proposto, visto i disagi, di pagarlo al prezzo da loro proposto in quel momento, ma naturalmente nessuna risposta.Ad oggi (7 ottobre 2014) il Samsung S5 risulta ancora spedito ma non consegnato e la data di spedizione il giorno 25 settembre.Chicca finale: apro il pacco. Invece del colore bianco che avevo richiesto è arrivato nero.Non solo: il pacco arriva non dalla Germania ma dalla provincia di Caserta. Niente da dire naturalmente ma allora perchè 10 giorni per la consegna?Io posso capire che ci possano essere problemi con la spedizione e che a volte i tempi non vengano rispettati (anche se è la prima volta che mi capita con Amazon) ma la mancanza di informazioni non è giustificabile.Non fosse altro perchè ho speso più di 500 euro.Pro: nessunoContro: poca informazione, oggetto non corrispondente (per il colore) a quanto ordinato, tempi di consegna non rispettati.",2014年10月7日 在意大利审核

Eingeschränkte SD Karte Nutzung,"Im großen und ganzen schließe ich mich den positiven Bewertungen anderer Rezensenten an.Es gibt aber einen wichtigen Punkt der mir sauer aufgestoßen ist: Die nur eingeschränkte nutzbare SD Karte seit Andorid 4.4.Gleich vorab: Dies betrifft wahrscheinlich alle 4.4er Geräte von Samsung (und wahrscheinlich auch andere Hersteller).Hintergrund: Mit 4.4 hat Samsung ein bereits längere Zeit im Stock Android vorhandenes neues Rechtekonzept für Zugriffe von Apps auf die SD Karte übernommen. Nun können die meisten (nicht Vorinstallierten ) Apps im Idealfall nur noch auf ein ihnen zugewiesenes Verzeichnis auf der Karte schreiben. Auf dieses Verzeichnis haben wiederum andere Apps keinen Schreibzugriff.Beim Löschen der Apps wird das gesamte Verzeichnis mit allen Daten ebenfalls gelöscht!Dies heißt: Einfach mal seine Daten (Bilder, Bücher, Texte, Audios) auf die Karte packen um dann mit verschiedenen Apps darauf zuzugreifen, ist nun nicht mehr ohne weiteres möglich. Der Fehler (Google bezeichnet es als ""Verbesserung"") kann eigentlich durch Anpassung einer einzelnen XML Datei behoben werden, erfordert aber zu vor ein rooten des Gerätes (und damit einhergehend einen Garantieverlust).Details zu diesem Thema lassen sich mittlerweile zu hauf im Netz finden (Stichworte: Andorid 4.4 sd card permissions).Dieser eine(!) Punkt (und dessen Handhabung durch Samsung) veranlasst mich nun leider dem Produkt nur eine Drei-Sterne Bewertung zu geben. Sollte Samsung den Fehler mit einem Update beheben, werde ich meine Bewertung entsprechend anpassen.Bis dahin der Ratschlag an alle Käufer betroffener 4.4er Smartphones: Überlegt euch gut, ob Ihr auf der SD Karte mehr als nur eure geschossenen Bilder ablegen wollt! Denn viel mehr geht im Moment nicht.",2014年5月12日 在德国审核

Als es heute ankam, musste ich feststellen, dass anstelle eines neuen S5 ein gebrauchtes und offenkundig repariertes Handy übersandt wurde. Das war wie folgt zu erkennen (siehe Bilder):- Originalverpackung mit Verschmutzungen und Gebrauchsspuren sowie offenbar nachgemachten Aufklebern- Rückcover des S5 entspricht nicht der Originalfarbe weiß sondern ist gelblich- keine Schutzfolie auf der Kamera, Kamera verschmutzt- in Inneren deutlich erkennbare Alters- bzw. Gebrauchsspuren- das Handy wurde schon einmal repariert, dabei wurde mindestens eine, nicht dem Original übereinstimmende Schraube verwendet- Gebrauchspuren und Verschmutzung in der USB-Buchse- Abdeckung der USB-Buchse ist offenbar nicht original sondern schon mal getauscht wordenDie Funktionsfähigkeit habe ich gar nicht erst geprüft, sondern das Handy gleich wieder eingepackt. Es geht noch heute zurück an Amazon. Zumindest von Amazon selbst habe ich erwartet, dass ich ein Handy, welches als neu angeboten wird, auch als solches erhalte.An dieser Stelle möchte ich jedem Käufer eines als neu angebotenen Handys raten, nach dem Kauf sofort zu prüfen, ob es sich tatsächlich um ein Neugrät handelt.

Leider Pech gehabt,"Nach einer Kaufmpfehlung aus der Familie hatte ich mir das Samsung S5 gekauft. Ich dachte auch aufgrund der vielen positiven Rezensionen, dass sich so viele Menschen nicht irren können. Leider bin ich aber auch direkt auf ein Montagsgerät gestoßen. Da ich bisher ein HTC Besitzer war, kannte ich mich mit den Samsung Gepflogenheiten nicht aus. Beim Laden des Smartphones konnte ich das Display nicht ausschalten. Es machte summ und schon war es wieder an. Daher lud es natürlich langsam auf, da das Display ständig zu sehen war. Das ist vor allem nachts super praktisch, da ich das Handy ja auch als Wecker benutze. Am zweiten Tag fiel mir dann der Buchstabe ""G"" von SAMSUNG von der Rückseite des Smartphones ab. Und am dritte Tag hat es dann komplett den Dienst verweigert. Ich habe es zum Laden komplett heruntergefahren und nie wieder anbekommen. Alle Tricks und Starts halfen nichts. Das heißt,das Smartphone ging mit all meinen Einträgen zurück an den Verkäufer, der das Geld völlig problemlos wieder an mich überwies. Dennoch ärgert es mich, dass ich das Smartphone vor der Rückgabe nicht ""platt"" machen konnte. Was mir aufgefallen ist, dass sich die Plastikhülle des Samsung S5 wirklich billig und dünn angefühlt hat. Das hat mich ein wenig gestört und hier war ich von HTC eine andere Qualität gewohnt. Nun bin ich wieder zurück zu HTC. Habe ein HTC desire eye und bin super zufrieden. Ich habe das Gefühl, dass es viel mehr Raffinessen hat und es macht tolle Selfies, da es sowohl vorne als auch hinten eine 13 Mio Pixel Kamera hat.",2016年3月23日 在德国审核

Polnisches Modell geliefert,"Diese Bewertung wird nach und nach aktualisiert.Das Smartphone wurde beim amazon.de-Händler ""DMCO International"" bestellt.Leider hat sich der erste Eindruck der Verpackung bestätigt, es ist ein für den polnischen Markt gedachtes Modell. Das Smartphone sollte trotzdem funktionieren, es wäre jedoch schön, wenn die Bedienungsanleitung auch auf Deutsch oder zumindest Englisch wäre.Zusätzlich sind auch teilweise die vorinstallierten Apps auf polnisch.Nach einem Android Update sind diese Apps jedoch weg, das Smartphone funktioniert wie es sein sollte.",2015年6月18日 在德国审核
"Super Technik, ungutes Gefühl bei Datenschutzbestimmungen, schwache Wiederherstellungssoftware","Ich habe mir das Galaxy S5 gekauft, weil mein iPhone 4 mittlerweile ernsthafte Performance Probleme bekam. Es waren hauptsächlich die Berichte zur Akkulaufzeit des iPhone 6, die mir den hohen Preis des Telefons nicht zu rechtfertigen schienen. Ich komme also eigentlich aus dem ""Apple Lager"".Ich war und bin immer noch beeindruckt von dem Display des S5 - die Abbildungen sind scharf und - besser als jedes andere Display, das ich bis jetzt gesehen habe - hervorragend in direktem Sonnenlicht ablesbar. Die Kamera gefällt mir sehr gut. Obwohl ich bis jetzt fremd war im Android-Land, fand ich die Software doch gut erlernbar - in manchen Bereichen weniger logisch strukturiert als in iOS - in anderen Bereichen flexibler als iOS. Im wesentlichen sind es die Vorzüge und Nachteile, die in vielen Direktvergleichen und Internetforen zu lesen sind. Um es kurz zu machen: Die Hardware ist hervorragend, und die Software ist gefällig und leicht zu bedienen.Dennoch gibt es einige Aspekte der Software und des gesamten Distributionssystems, die ich als sehr nachteilig erachte:1. Updates von Android werden nur sehr verzögert / oder gar nicht an die Benutzer weitergeleitet. Die aktuelle Version ist Android 5.1.1, mein S5 zeigt immer noch 5.0 (wobei ich nicht erkennen kann, ob 5.0, 5.0.1, oder 5.0.2) Android 5.1 ist schon seit März 2015 released, aber Ende September 2015 noch nicht bei mir angekommen.2. Das Telefon ist voll von Bloatware (für mich unnütze Software) wie 'pizza.de', 'blurb', 'ChatOn', die mich einfach nicht interessieren und die ich nicht nutzen müsste.3. Das Telefon lief gut und die Akkulaufzeit war hervorragend, bis das Update auf Android 5.0 kam. Danach wurde das Telefon oft sehr heiss, und der Akku reichte mit Mühe und Not über den Tag. Halt eines der üblichen Probleme, wenn ein grosser neuer Release veröffentlicht wird. Mir ist bis heute noch nicht klar, was das Problem verursacht hat - es wurde jedoch schnell offensichtlich, dass das Telefon vor allem Nachts immer wieder aufwacht und versucht sich mit dem Internet zu verbinden. Die einzigen zwei Möglichkeiten, die mir blieben, waren a) entweder das WLAN nachts auszuschalten (und sobald ich meine Wohnung verlassen hatte von WLAN auf mobile Daten umzuschalten), oder b) es Abends zum Aufladen an das Ladegerät anzuschliessen.4. Ich halte die Samsung Tools zur Datensicherung auf lokale Computer (das was bei Apple iTunes viel besser macht) für ungenügend.a) Nachdem die Akkuprobleme anhielten, beschloss ich schließlich, das S5 auf Werkseinstellungen zurückzusetzen, nachdem ich eine Sicherung des Telefons auf meinen Computer gesichert hatte. Erfreut stellte ich fest, dass es Samsung Kies mittlerweile auch für OS X (das Apple Betriebssystem) gibt. Nach der Installation musste ich feststellen, dass Samsung - wohl zur Verbesserung des Services - u.a. die MAC Adresse der Netzwerkkarte meines Computers an hauseigene Server übermittelt (neben anderen Merkmalen über die Konfiguration des Rechners, auf dem Kies installiert ist). Das hinterlässt bei mir einen sehr schlechten Eindruck - benutze ich doch die MAC Adresse als einen Baustein der Sicherung meines Heimnetzwerkes. Es gelang mir mittels eines zugekauften USB 3.0 Kabels die Konfiguration und die Daten des S5 in vertretbarer Zeit zu sichern (so im Zeitrahmen von 40 min - 1 Stunde). Danach setzte ich das Telefon zurück (ist ja auf ganz unterschiedlichen Seiten im Internet gut erklärt) und musste danach feststellen, dass das Telefon wieder voll von Bloatware war. ""Naja - die wird wohl nach dem Zurückspeichern der Sicherungsdateien wieder verschwunden sein."" --- Weit gefehlt. Ich musste die Wiederherstellung des Telefons zweimal abbrechen, einmal nach gefühlten 15 Stunden, und einmal nach 12 Stunden (mit dem USB 3.0 Kabel!!!). Wie bei allen komplexen Systemen heutzutage ist es natürlich schwer die Ursache des Problems genau festzustellen -mir scheint es jedoch für Samsung da noch einigen Nachholbedarf zu geben. Ich will den Vergleich zum Apple Ökosystem nicht zu sehr betonen, ABER: Auch iPhones und iPads müssen gelegentlich zurückgesetzt werden - aber das ist doch von Apple um Welten besser gelöst als das, was sich mir mit meinem Galaxy S5 dargeboten hat.b) Nach dem unglücklich verlaufenden Wiederherstellen musste ich natürlich noch die ""BloatWare"" entfernen, musste mich bei allen Services neu anmelden (Heureka - damit ich das nicht machen muss, habe ich eine Systemsicherung durchgeführt), ich musste meine Screens alle neu erstellen, ich glaube auch einige Apps nachinstallierten, und schließlich mein Kartenapp löschen und nachinstallieren, weil be dessen ""Wiederherstellung"" offensichtlich einiges schief gegangen ware, und Funktionen wie Sprachausgabe, Geschwindigkeitsanzeige, Richtungsanzeige, gefahrenen und noch zu fahrende Kilometer einfach nicht mehr funktionierten.Um es nochmal zusammenzufassen: Das Telefon selber - die Hardware und die Software (Android Lollipop) - ist ein beeindruckendes Gerät. Das Distributionssystem für die Software (vor allem, dass die Hardware-Hersteller eigene Modifikationen machen und so der Release-Prozess (so verstehe ich das jedenfalls) in die Länge gezogen wird) erscheint mir deutlich Nachteilig zu sein im Vergleich zu anderen Hardware/Softwareplattformen (PC, iOS). Der Administrator des Systems (also: ich) wird von der Samsung Software zur Sicherung der Daten schlecht unterstützt. Ok - ich könnte meine Daten auch bei Google oder Samsung sichern --- den Teufel werde ich tun :). Ich habe mein eigenes Backup-System, da sind meine Daten (die, die noch nicht an Apple, Google, oder Samsung verraten sind) am besten aufgehoben! Insgesamt habe ich die Erfahrung gemacht, dass man mit Android und Samsung viel mehr in die Pflicht genommen ist, sein System zu administrieren, als dies bei Apple und iOS der Fall ist. Eine Stärke der Apple-Plattform ist, dass die Administrator-Tätigkeit (das Verbinden verschiedener Apple-Geräte zur gemeinsamen Nutzung beim Lösen von Aufgaben) größtenteils von Apple übernommen wird. Wer selber basteln will, kann das mit Herzenslust mit Android tun. Ich will das nicht, deswegen finde ich die Apple-Plattform so attraktiv.",2015年9月27日 在德国审核
"Beim Händler ""ZOXS GmBH"" gut!","Das Telefon kam vom im Titel besagten Händler recht zügig zu mir an . Es war Sicher verpackt mit OVP und Kabel und dem Telefon selbst. Das Telefon hat wie beschrieben Gebrauchsspuren die Ladekappe fehlt (kostet euch die Wasserfestigkeit) und ein relativ stark eingebranntes Display . Die Tastatur und statusleiste sind sichtbar eingebrannt. Für den Preis aber völlig vertretbar. Dafür Glas komplett heile . Softwareseitig sehr positiv überrascht. Das Gerät war nicht ""geknoxt"" und es war das Offizielle Android 6.0.1 von Samsung vorinstalliert.Allerdings mit o2 Branding (CSC:VIA) dies war zwar nicht erwähnt aber in Ordnung,positiver Nebeneffekt Volte da ich selber im o2 netz unterwegs bin. Sollte euer S5 auch gebrandet sein , lasst die Finger vom ""unbranden"" ab dem S5 gibt es starke Probleme über Odin ein anderes Branding bzw in meinem Fall das Brandingfreie (DBT) zu installieren.Musste dann per Odin das o2 Branding wieder flashen. Findige füchse werden da sicher trotzdem einen Weg finden den Odin Flash Fail zu umgehen allerdings meine Empfehlung wenn ihr Ein Branding bekommt lasst es drauf oder flasht eine Custom Rom. In diesem Sinne für 70 euro plus 12 versand in Ordnung. Das S5 ist selbst 2020 völlig in Ordnung.

tolle Kamera sonst na ja,"Bin von dem Galaxy S5 etwas enttäuscht.Der Fingerlese Sensor ist leider unbrauchbar, da man ihn nur zuverlässig benützen kann wenn man das Gerät mit beiden Händen hält. ( Man muss den Daumen über den Sensor ziehen) Ansonsten wird das Lesen zu einem Glücksspiel.Hier hat Apple wesentlich bessere Arbeit abgeliefert.( Handy in der Hand halten, Daumen kurz drauf liegen lassen und das Gerät entsperrt sich, das macht Sinn. )Leider ist das Gerät so groß, dass man es einhändig nicht gut bedienen kann. Auch wenn man es in der Hosentasche stecken hat, ( z.B beim Autofahren ) ist es ohne Verrenkungen nicht möglich das Teil aus der Hosentasche zu bekommen.Die Steuerung des Audio players über meinen Beats Kopfhörer funktioniert lieder nicht richtig ( nur nächster Titel und Pause, lauter leiser geht nicht ). Bei Handy in dieser Preisklasse erwarte ich mir schon dass so etwas grundlegendes funktioniert.Positiv hervorheben muss man die Kamera, die wirklich bei allen Lichtverhältnissen erstklassige Bilder macht.Bin nach einer Woche wieder auf mein iPhone 5s zurückumgestiegen.",2014年4月26日 在德国审核

Grandioso.,"Avevo già comprato un S5 due anni fa ma mi si è rotto e non carica più. Probabilmente è riparabile, ma nel frattempo avevo urgenza di un sostituto e dopo attenta analisi ho deciso di restare in casa Samsung e riprendere lo stesso telefono. Ho provato questo ricondizionato che pubblicizzata usura minima e garanzia 6 mesi se non erro. Mi è arrivato in perfette condizioni che sembrava nuovo. Ho riso quando è venuto via lo sportellino inferiore per le prese USB, perché dopotutto il venditore aveva specificato che ci sarebbe stata un minimo di usura, anche se mi aspettavo un righetto sullo schermo o una dentatura.

Bestes Smartphone derzeit auf dem Markt,"Ich hatte das S2, S3, S4 bis vor kurzem das Note 3 und nun auch das S5 und ich kann nur sagen, dass jedes Gerät von Samsung welches ich bisher besaß einfach nur perfekt war.Die Galaxy Reihe ist einfach schnell, praktisch und bis ins kleinste Deteil durchdacht. Wer etwas anderes behauptet ist entweder Appelfreak oder hatte noch nie ein Samsung Galaxy länger als ein paar Tage zur Verfügung.Ich kann jedem nur den Kauf des Gerätes empfehlen 600 Euronen sind zwar ein haufen Asche für wie sagen Appelfreaks: ""so ein Plastikhaufen"" aber das Gerät ist wirklich jeden Cent wert.Und übrigens wer ein 600 Euro Smartphone bessitzt schützt es im normalfall mit einer Hülle und was macht es da bitte für einen Unterschied ob das Gehäuse des Gerätes aus Aluminium oder Glas ist? Man fasst ja doch nur die Hülle an und die sind meistens auch aus Plastik. Außerdem ist meiner Meinung nach Samsung die Verarbeitung des S5 sehr gut gelungen.Und wer jetzt sagt Samsung macht doch eh alles Appel nach der ist einfach nur neidisch, dass es auch andere Firmen gibt die tolle Geräte entwickeln können und damit genauso erfolgreich und sogar auch noch besser sind als Appel. Was macht denn Sony und HTC? Auch alles Appel nach oder wie? Ich wäre lieber froh das es Firmen gibt die es verhindern das Appel eine Monopolstellung bekommt. Oder wollt ihr alle in Zukunft tausende für euer geliebtes Iphone ausgeben?Außerdem an alle Appelfans dieser Welt: Es ist schon seit langem bekannt, dass Appel Bauteile für seine Iphones bei Samsung kauft.

Vollkommen zufrieden,"Ich bin bis jetzt mit dem Samsung Galaxy S5 vollkommen zufrieden. Die Einrichtung hat völlig problemlos funktioniert.Bisher sind keine Aufhänger und Verzögerungen vorgekommen (auch trotz vielen Updates und Downloads von Apps).Es sind viele Apps vorinstalliert (viele die einfach unnötig sind). Diese kann man aber immerhin deaktivieren, sodass diese nicht unnötig im Menü sind.Ich hatte vorher ein Samsung Galaxy i9000.(natürlich ist dieses kaum mit dem S5 zu vergleichen) Die Unterschiede sind natürlich im Zeitverlauf einfach nur Wahnsinn. Nicht nur die Größe sondern auch die Aufmachung des Menü's und die Änderungen der Funktionen sind einfach anders.Die Größe des Smartphones ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, vor allem weil ich ""kleine Frauenhände"" habe, aber dennoch funktioniert die Handhabung sehr gut.Bis jetzt bin ich voll und ganz zufrieden.

Nur Notrufe möglich,"Ich habe das Handy schon seit 6 Wochen. Manchmal dauert es einige Stunden, manchmal sogar einige Tage bis ich die Information auf dem Display sehe ""Nur Notrufe möglich"". In dieser Zeit kann ich niemanden Anrufen (Kein Netz), bekomme ich keine E-Mail oder andere Benachrichtigungen. Das Schlimmste ist aber, dass ich für andere Menschen nicht erreichbar bin.Ich habe in diesen 6 Wochen schon mit 3 SIM-Karten probiert, weil ich dachte, dass vielleicht die NEUEN Karten doch defekt sind oder der Empfang vor Ort so schlecht ist, obwohl gerade 100% war. Ich habe mit Congstar, Simyo und EDEKA-mobil versucht. Leider ohne Erfolg.

Schlechte Erfahrung mit Verkäufer Carbon Phone,"Nach etwa 3 Monaten gab das S 5 leider ""seinen Geist auf"". Das Display war ohne erkennbaren Anlass von jetzt auf gleich bunt/streifig mit massiven Pixelfehlern bzw. dann dunkel, das Handy unbenutzbar. Wir haben das Handy an den Verkäufer Carbon Phone zwecks Reparatur zurückgeschickt. Damit begann allerdings eine Odyssee. Wir wurden fast 8 Wochen mit standardisierten und orthographisch teils fehlerhaften E-Mail-Nachrichten hingehalten. Am Ende hieß es dann, die Gewährleistung sei verfallen.Als das Handy nach knapp 8 Wochen zurückkam, war es nicht repariert und mit dem Vermerk versehen ""Mechanische Beschädigung - Displayschaden - Verfall der Gewährleistung - Gerät unrepariert zurück"". Zusätzlich zu dem ursprünglichen Defekt wies das Handy nun noch eine neue Beschädigung auf, und zwar einen deutlich zu erkennenden Riss auf rückwärtigen Display-Seite. Außerdem war das Display an der umlaufenden Klebenaht nahezu vollständig vom Gehäuse abgelöst.Auf uns wirkt es so, als ob das Display bei dem Versuch, es zu prüfen oder zu reparieren, beschädigt worden ist. Wir fragen uns auch, wieso ein Reparaturdienst insgesamt fast 8 Wochen braucht, um einen angeblich vorliegenden, so offensichtlichen Schaden festzustellen.Auch auf unseren nochmaligen Hinweis darauf, dass Carbon Phone aus unserer Sicht zur Gewährleistung verpflichtet ist, erhielten wir eine nichtssagende abschlägige Antwort.",2017年6月27日 在德国审核

"Great phone, low price.","Posted this mid 2018. 2 of my sisters, my wife, &amp; I are all using the S5. It's fast enough, and supports current apps. Unlike some newer phones, it has a micro SD slot - Saves $ &amp; allows me to upgrade when larger chips become available. I'm on my 2nd S5, and no reason to replace it. This cost me about 6% of what an S8 was going to cost from our cell service provider. I don't use a cover, or have insurance on it, because it's relatively cheap to replace. The unprotected screen has yet to get a scratch in it (I do machine shop work, &amp; build/repair things at home). My wife uses a cover, My daughter uses an S7 because it has a better camera, but I'm fine with the S5's. I'm much happier carrying a phone that I don't have to obsess over.",2018年6月29日 在美国审核
Meets and exceeds expectations.,"Have had the phone half a day.I agree with most of the positive reviews of the phone and coming from a Droid 3, it took me a while to get the hang of the new interface and download all the apps I had purchased on the Droid.To my surprise, Verizon (or my sdcard) remembered which apps I had purchased and I was able to download and reinstall free of charge.Saved me about $20 in apps alone.Phone is big and easy to read, but not too big, and surprisingly light and thin (remember this morning I was still using my Droid3 brick).Some important observations: 1) The included headphones are totally lacking base and sound washed out.Not even close to the quality of the Creative Zen I was using so I will continue with the Zen.2) When ordering on Amazon, I chose the ""replace a phone on my existing account"" option.But the checkout chose to change my data plan and ""estimated"" I will be paying $40 more a month than I was.Called Amazon and Verizon and the consensus was to let the sale go through and change the plan back when I activate the phone.Well after activating on the phone, the plan did not change.So all is well.",2014年8月5日 在美国审核
Apple convert. Should have done this a long time ago,"IPhone 4s finally became unusable after the latest ios update. I had to carefully consider the new iPhone since we have three iphones, two ipads, a macbook, and apple TV. I did my homework and realized that the iPhone 6 didn't offer anything the Galaxy s5 hadn't already been delivering for months. I was also ready for a bigger screen upgrade than a 4.7, but not ready for a phablet.Amazons deal on the phone was the final nail in the coffin. I've been able to get the phone, case, belt clip, screen protector, three car chargers, spare home charger, and 6' USB cable all for $185. For another $40 i can add 64g of memory on a high speed card.In order to match the package with a new iPhone I'd spend $300, plus another $100 or so on a Lifeproof Case and clip whenever they're available to keep it water resistant. For 64g total, I'd have to add another $100. And I'd still have a screen almost a half inch smaller with no ability to change batteries or memory cards.After only three days of use I'm already feeling comfortablewith this phone. I needed to use my old iPhone today to turn off imessages, and I thought I was going to have to borrow my dad's reading glasses. If you're thinking about making the switch- do it.

Happily back in the Samsung fold!,"Happy to be back.I purchased this phone to replace a phone that I hated (another brand).I've had Samsung phones before and don't know why I strayed from the brand.I'd purchased this other phone because it supposedly had a super camera.Yes, it took nice pictures but deleted photos at will.I called their support who assured me that the phone wouldn't do this.I've had smartphones since they first came out and have NEVER had it delete photos. (For those of you who might say 'yes,s if you're memory's full this will happen/'Yes, this is true but my settings were to save to the SD card which was only half-full - and the phone memory wasn't full either. Anyway, .having learned my lesson I chose this phone as opposed to a newer version because it still has a removable battery and SD card plus this particular model has more dust and moisture resistance than other models.I've only had time to go through some of the newer features and so far it surpassed my non-Samsung fiasco.I'm happy I ""saw the light"" and bought this phone.",2016年4月12日 在美国审核
I really like this phone,"So far, after only 10 days or so, I really like this phone.It's light and easy to carry, not as big as I thought it would be. I'm not a phone geek.I mostly use my phone as a phone with an occasional text and to keep tabs on emails I get throughout the day.The S5 was very intuitive to get started with and to use.I had no problems importing my contacts or updating/cleaning out out of date items.Everyone seems to rave about the camera so I had higher expectations.It's fine, but certainly not as good as a real camera.I'm OK with it and it's easy to use as well.Call quality is good and notifications definitely keep you updated on your messages, calls, update status, etc.It's easy to either remove or disable a lot of the apps on the phone that I'll never use...like games and sports apps.I have no use for those and they were easy to remove.Others can easily be disabled.So, after only a few days I rate this phone very high.It's the best phone I've ever used...not that that's a ringing endorsement...I used a flip-phone up until a few years ago.I'd say anyone would be hard-pressed to find something negative about this unless you're really, really picky.",2014年11月11日 在美国审核
S5 much better than S3,"I had been using a Samsung Galaxy S3 but had horrible reception where I live. I noticed that a different Samsung phone had better reception and also got a 4G signal, which I had never gotten with my S3. So I ordered this S5 refurbished. It arrived today. First thing I did was charge the battery. Once that was done I transferred the SIM card and 64G SD card into the new phone and turned it on. After a few minutes of setup it was off and running. I have more bars than before and it shows a 3G signal. I was a little nervous about buying a refurbished phone, but it came with a protective film over the screen and there was not a mark on it anywhere. It looked like new. I should add that using the NFC I was able to transfer a bunch of stuff from the old phone (even without the SIM card in it) to the new one. One concern I had was the new S5 has a different power port from the S3. But I learned that the old micro USB plug can fit into the new port. But using the new charge cable that came with the phone charges it faster. I could not be more pleased.",2015年12月2日 在美国审核
Great Pokemon Go phone,"Pokemon go players! We have 2 of these phones set up exclusively for playing Pokemon go.We tried S4 phones for Pokemon but battery wear and heat seems to be a bit too much for the S4 to handle. S5 seems to be just fast enough to currently run Pokemon Go smoothly. The phone can get warm to very warm but no heat warnings or shut downs as long as we shut off blue-tooth and or WiFi and manage the screen brightness only during midday battling a strong gym, otherwise it runs flawlessly when its not so bright out and during regular play.Bottom line: Great affordable starter phone for Pokemon go.

I love this phone,"I love this phone. I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 Mini and it is a drastic difference. Bigger but still able to fit in side pockets. The microsd card can be swapped without the need to turn off the phone and remove the battery. I transfer files and download quite a bit, so the ability to swap out the sd card without service interruption is awesome. With the usb 3.0 (Micro-B) connection it allows for OTG accessories. I have a mini keyboard that I use for times when the on-screen keyboard would be a hinderance during programming and debugging. I no longer need an extra app to keep track of my running schedule, as S Health can track running, cycling, heart rate, sleep, and acts as a full time pedometer.

6 months in and so far it's pretty good.,"Owned and used for about 6 months now. I like the fingerprint scan option but it can be a bit fickle from time to time. You have to scan ur finger in a precise way. But once u get used to it it's not bad and I unlock my phone many times a day. I only rarely use the password option. BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT. I get a full day of mixed use(checking Clash of Clans, FB, news apps, texts and the occasional call) and usually have at least 20% battery life left at the end of the day. Sometimes a lot more. My day starts around 6 am and ends when I get home around 9:30 pm. I have used the extended low power battery option only once. It works as advertised.However I only used it for 1 extra day in the ultra battery saver mode.If u only use ur phone lightly u might be able to go 2 full days or more on regular mode without rechargeing.I switched over from a Motorola Bionic. The S5 is faster has better battery life by far. Also take good pictures. Also it is quicker to acquire my GPS location for navigation.My only complaint is that occasionally, the Facebook app will show a zoomed in view of pictures that folks post. This requires me selecting the actual post and looking at the full size view to see the whole thing. It is odd and I think it is a FB issuance and not a phone issue. It has since been corrected by the latest FB app update. But still happens occasionally when browsing the FB app.So far I love the phone.

Great Android Phone With Lots Of Bells And Whistles,"I've been an Android user for about 4 years now, and this is the best phone I've owned. There are plenty of positive reviews that reflect what a solid phone Samsung has built. I'd like to address some of the special merits this phone has now that I've spent a couple weeks with it. *I'm upgrading from a Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, therefore I can't speak to what makes this phone different from previous versions.*1. Expandable storage - Yes, the phone only comes with 16GB of internal storage. I use a 32GB card and have no space problems with all of my favorite apps installed. Almost all apps that I've downloaded can be moved to the card. I also use it to store photos and videos. All of my music is stored in Google's Play Music cloud.2. Removable battery - This is a unique feature now that I find helpful. It's worth it to buy a back up battery that you keep charged for times when you don't have access to a charger or an outlet. This is especially useful for long trips. I've found that with moderate use the battery lasts about a day and a half after a full charge.3. Disabling apps - Android phones notoriously come loaded up with software, both from the manufacturer and the carrier. Between Samsung and Verizon there are probably a dozen apps that I don't need. Samsung has a feature that allows you to disable apps you don't use. Although it doesn't remove the app from the phone, it removes it from the app drawer and prevents it from running in the background. Out of sight, out of mind for me.4. Fingerprint scanner/heart rate monitor - Okay, these are definitely more on the gimmick side of things and not phone essentials. However, when used correctly both can be useful. I do high intensity interval training and heart rate is a major part of that. I have a Polar heart rate monitor that I use, and I found that the phone is incredibly accurate for measuring BPM by comparing results from the two. There is a companion app called S-health that allows you to keep track of diet and exercise. In an increasingly health conscious world I find that very helpful. The fingerprint scanner is a good layer of security, but make no mistake, if someone is determined to get in your phone they will find a way. It's more of a safeguard just like having a password would be.5. Vibrant launcher (Touchwiz) with lots of customization - Having owned a few Androids the one thing that always bothered me was the ""coldness"" of the launchers they typically come with. This phone is very colorful and that makes my eyes happy. It's evident that Samsung put a lot of thought into the design of this phone from a software perspective. If you prefer the simplicity of pure Android you'll want to install a custom launcher (there are quite a few awesome ones for free in the Play store) or root the phone.6. It's made of plastic - I immediately put a case on my phone so I honestly don't care what it's made out of. The hardware in this phone far outweighs the material the back cover is made from. However, if aesthetics are a huge concern for you it may not be to your tastes.7. Battery saver - This phone has a couple power saving options. One of these options converts the phone to gray scale and severely limits the amount of processes running to prolong the battery life for days. This is a great feature for people who need their phone on, but don't want to waste battery juice when charging won't be an option for a long time.8. Easy mode/blocking mode/private mode - Each one does vastly different things, and it speaks to the fact that Samsung is appealing to all types of users. Easy mode for people who don't want their smartphone to be TOO smart, blocking mode for turning off pesky notifications during certain times (e.g., turn off phone ringing between certain hours except for certain contacts), and private mode for securing your phone just a bit more. None of these options are on by default so if you don't want to use them, you don't have to. I really like that Samsung baked these features into the phone without making them intrusive. These aren't apps, they are settings.Those are just some of the obvious ways the phone stands out to me. I'll quickly run down a list of things that this phone has that other reviewers love as well: great camera, good battery life, big screen, fast processor, user friendly, good call quality (if anyone is actually concerned about that anymore).If you're already an Android user, this phone will not disappoint. If you're an Apple user thinking about making the switch I suggest you read the return policy (I believe Verizon gives you 15 days). It may not suit your tastes because it is a completely different operating system with a learning curve. I prefer complexity with my phones, but there's a reason iPhones are so popular - a lot of people want a phone they don't have to fiddle with at all.",2014年5月9日 在美国审核

Best Phone Yet,I recently upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S3 to this S5 and I was glad I did.Pros- Screen is much more vibrant than the S3- Fast- Battery lasts a long time- Camera is amazingCons- Charging port is kind of annoying to plug in and not as easy as the S3 (not a big deal)- Personally I think the back cover is ugly but you can buy a cover- Made of plastic vs AluminumOther- I haven't used the fingerprint scanner or the heartrate monitor- Shipping was much faster than estimated by Amazon.,2014年12月2日 在美国审核
Amazon Customer Service FTW!,"I've had several iterations of Samsung phones, the S3 was my first smartphone, bought the S4 and now recently purchased the S5. After 2 months my screen stopped responding, as in the display itself was fine but the phone would no longer respond to touch. No big drops or anything so 99% sure it was a defect with the phone. I tried to get Samsung to fix it and they went out of their way to avoid any warranty work. After a short chat with Amazon they sent a replacement, 3 days later I had a new phone. This experience soured me slightly on Samsung, but I still think they make the best value smartphones out there, however I'm 100% sold on Amazon based on their reaction, will be a Prime customer for life. I was a little wary of buying a seemingly discounted smartphone via amazon and not Verizon or directly from Samsung, turned out to be a good decision.",2016年11月27日 在美国审核

Ended up buying 2 so my husband could replace his cracked one as well!,"So I know these phones are older so that maybe why they are slower, but for the price I think they are pretty okay and I would recommend to other's as a way cheaper option than going through a rear or replacement for newer phones. The worst part I think is that the touch sensor is sometimes really laggy and won't register touches or key presses, and also the speaker sounds like it is a tad shot. However, overall it is a decent phone.The battery life is dependent on use really, if I use it a lot it online it dies very fast but if it is just on standby in my bag or whatever and I only used for calls and texts it last's all day and night. The camera works and phone calls come in clear and there was like no noticeable damage! Overall for the price I am pretty pleased.",2021年1月12日 在美国审核

Poor quality.,"Headphone jack is defective...you can't insert the plug all the way so no way to actually use headphones.(Yes, I'm doing it correctly &amp; know these phones have very tight-fitting jacks...we have 2 of them in the house.)Since I don't use them all that often (usually only when travelling), I didn't discover it within the return window.If you buy this phone, check EVERYTHING on it thoroughly the instant you receive it. Workmanships is pretty sketchy.Other issues: If you lose cell signal (common in my big concrete office building), the phone generally won't rediscover it without being completely re-started. Simply walking outside like with my old phone doesn't cut it. You can't stop it from telling you daily to update the system. You can decline the updates (I hate the newer versions of some of my apps and DON'T want to update them) but you can't stop the 3 screens trying to get you to do so every single day. Built-in apps that you really have no choice but to use (like Gallery) require you to give them permission to access things they don't actually need and are frankly none of google's business. If you care about privacy at all, this is definitely not the phone to get.",2017年1月17日 在美国审核
Long time Samsung smartphone user tickled pink,"I am a long-time Samsung fan, having had three phones over the years. Typically I have no desire to replace my Samsung phone after two years when I'm eligible for an upgrade, because even though technology advances a lot in two years, I am happy with my phone and what it can do. I was very happy with my Galaxy S3, but it was damaged and I decided to replace it.I went to Verizon and with my upgrade I could get a Galaxy S4 for $50, or pay $199 for an S5. What? Then I remembered about Amazon, and saw a great price on the S5 and the ability to upgrade through Verizon with Amazon, which is NO DIFFERENT than doing it on the Verizon Wireless upgrade site. You log in to Verizon through Amazon and process your upgrade, except you pay a lot less with Amazon for this particular phone. More people ought to know about this, since many people I talk to don't realize that you can get any phone you want - you don't have to go through Verizon Wireless to upgrade your phone. We have options, people! :-)I knew the S6 was coming out soon, but I never need the ""latest and greatest"" model and I knew I'd be happy with the S5, and I am. I didn't realize how many tiny little annoying things were associated with my S3 until I got the S5, then all of the sudden it has features and conveniences that practically changed my life, if you can believe it. I don't like to exaggerate but this phone truly thinks like I do, and anything I wanted to modify or customize, I found I could do it easily with this phone. It is very, very intuitive and endlessly customizable.I updated the OS for the new Lollipop not long after getting the phone, and though there are a few things that I didn't like about that upgrade it did not lessen my love for this phone. I don't want to rattle off all of my favorite features, because everyone has their own set of features that are important, but I could not be more pleased.One thing I was worried about was that it would be a whole lot bigger than the S3. I have very small hands and wondered if I'd be stretching out my thumb too far to try to hold it in one hand, but it did not prove to be a problem at all. With both phones out of their cases the S5 is only slightly larger, and I don't appreciate much difference in my day to day life.Maybe the S6 is just light years ahead of this phone, but I doubt it. I don't usually give reviews for my phones because so many people have the same model, and everyone is accustomed to what to expect from a smartphone. I thought I was too until I got this one and was delighted with some of the shortcuts and improvements that were made since the S3 that makes life just a tiny bit easier.",2015年3月31日 在美国审核

"A good first smartphone, especially if you get it almost-free with a contract.","I bought this phone with a Verizon contract, and I'm glad I did. I can't compare it to other smartphones, as this is the first I've ever owned, but considering I didn't pay anything for this other than a pittance and my general mobile bill, I consider the functionality well worth the contract. While 16 GB is a respectable amount of built-in storage for basic usage, however, I'd recommend also investing in a 32 GB MicroSD card or higher to go with it if you intend to download and use a large number of apps or games. The 16 GB mentioned is this device's built-in storage; the MicroSD card slot is unused and any additional storage media would add to it, not replace it.Hardware-wise, the Galaxy S5 is good for playing most mobile games I've thrown at it and while it does seem to have a pretty slow web browser, it's a nice little device in all other respects. Worth mentioning is that this particular smartphone has a number of functions that are quite handy, such as a fingerprint-scan screen-lock option that works well, and an option to increase touch-screen sensitivity for use with gloves (which can also be used to make the touch-screen compatible with a stylus pen or... just about anything you might have on hand, really). As a bonus, the pack-in earbuds aren't bad. Battery life isn't bad on standby, but when hardware-intensive apps or the internet connection are in use, it can drain relatively fast, so keep that in mind while using it.",2016年3月2日 在美国审核

"Coming off of a Nokia Windows phone (which I loved, but could not load many apps that were ...","(Her husband writes this.)I am one who uses my phone most for: texting, phone, Facebook, web searching.Coming off of a Nokia Windows phone (which I loved, but could not load many apps that were just for android or iPhone) it took me a while to get it set up and add apps that I wanted.I do recommend that anyone who gets this phone search on the web to find what pre-installed apps might serve worthy of uninstallation.I was impressed, and still am, at how fast it operates and have had absolutely no glitches so far.If I am careful to be sure all apps I am not using are closed down, my battery level does quite well.It is 8:30 pm right now and I first used my phone at 6:30 am; the battery is still at 68%.I shop a Amazon on my phone as easily as on my pc (a recommended app).If I were a real techy, I might have other things to say.The only downer is the usage of S Voice.On my Nokia, I was accustomed to be able to hear that I had a text, tell my phone to read it, compose a text reply and send it - all without taking my phone from its holster on my belt or averting my eyes from the road.As far as I can tell so far, I cannot do the same on this one. Supposedly, there is a way to do it, but I still have not figured it out. Further, mine is one of the multitude that will not connect to my ear Bluetooth device.It is paired with my computer via Bluetooth and I have sent files that way from one to the other.S Voice is great for asking questions and getting a fast answer.Compared to my Nokia, composing email is easier on this phone since one can tap on the screen anywhere in the message to edit.Also, many often-used symbols are available on the primary keyboard.If you like to use swipe, or would like to try it, it can be enabled.Because of the touchless messaging issue and Bluetooth problem, I would like to give this only 4.4 stars.",2015年2月20日 在美国审核

Upgraded and glad I did!,"I'm only one week into owning this phone so there may be more I discover as time progresses. First I will say I LOVE the large screen, the option for large font (always a plus if you're visually impaired like me) The camera is wonderful. Takes sharp, beautiful photos. There is an option under security that will allow the phone to be reset to factory default if the pin (to unlock phone) is entered incorrectly 10 times. This is good if you lose the phone, at least you don't have to worry about someone having your private photos and emails, etc. If you're familiar with the Samsung format you will know your way around this phone as it's the same as the S3 and S4 for the most part, just with a few tweaks. Now to grumble about a couple things. Samsung felt the need to put a tiny door over the charging port. Why? Maybe just to make it more difficult to plug and unplug the dang cord, especially in a dim room. The door is thin plastic and at the advice of a Verizon tech support person, I plan to just pull it off as I'm tired of trying to to pop it open with my fingernail. If you use a case--like me--this task is even more aggravating as the case somewhat blocks access to the little door. Also I am not overly impressed with the battery life. Granted I'm a heavy internet user. If you're only talking and texting during the day you should do fine. There are also battery saving options that improve the battery life. That said, keep a spare external battery around just in case.I applaud Amazon for offering this phone for much cheaper than Verizon and not making you jump through hoops to get a rebate. Who needs to mail in forms and receipts for a gift card when you can just get it cheaper off the bat on Amazon?",2014年12月10日 在美国审核

Totally satisfied with my decision,"When I purchased this phone off Amazon it was the first time I signed into a contract with Verizon. I was nervous about purchasing this phone off Amazon initially because I didn't know which smart phones were good but based off the ratings I read, I went ahead and purchased this phone. I was very satisfied with the price I paid. It came to $1.07 with a two year contract. The phone exceeded my expectations. I love the camera and the ability to edit my photos. And you will see that the camera is something a lot of people on here were quite happy with. I also like the fact that it has a removable battery. I hate phones where you are not able to remove the battery. It gives me a peace of mind that if something were to happen with the battery I am able to get a new one versus having to replace my phone.Immediately after I purchased this phone I seen the Note 4 and was a little upset that I did not get that phone but after my boyfriend purchased it I would have to say I'm happy with my decision on getting the Samsung galaxy s5. Although it would be nicer if it had the size that comes with the Note 4, there really isn't any feature the Note 4 has that makes me regret my decision with the Samsung s5.",2015年5月30日 在美国审核
It's a Galaxy Phone!,"Really this is what it is...at least if you are used to Galaxy phones. I upgraded from my Galaxy S3 to this after waiting to see what the Iphone 6 would be like. If you are coming from the S3 you will be very comfortable with this phone yet will also be VERY happy with the increased speed and rejuvenated battery life as well.There isn't many amazing things to this phone over the Galaxy S3 but like I said it will be more up to speed than your old phone. The heartbeat and other Health stuff is a nice little tracking thing...gets you thinking about your health a little more.I love the battery door for this phone. Seems a tiny bit cheezy looking in texture and material yet it really does give you a decent amount of grip. My S3 I had purchased one of the Pleather battery doors to add grip because I am all about slim phones and not bulky cases...and with this one this battery door offers the same grip for the most part and I like that...try gettign away without a case on the HTC One M8 once...bet that phone goes flying quite a few times!If you came from one of the many poor Android Phones to a Galaxy S3 and were blown away you may want to be prepared to be a little less blown away this time...but this is still probably one of the top 2...maybe three Android phones on the market. It is one of only two on the market right now I would recommend to most people. (HTC One M8, This and maybe LG G3)",2014年12月2日 在美国审核
factory gb used leaves not enough room for preferred apps,"I bought this Galaxy 5S to replace my three or four year old Motorola Droid smartphone which had cracked glass and had lost its camera function.Galaxy 5S came in good shape on time delivery. I took it to my local Verizon to get a SIM card and have it activated. Some of the buttons were backwards to what I was used to but I'm game to learn new things as long as it doesn't involve an iPhone. Once I got my phone home and charged up I got to know it and proceeded to download some apps that I'd had on my old Droid such as Facebook and Instagram and even Snapchat. At that point I stopped because I could tell it was getting full as it was only a 16 gigabyte. Here Comes fall and winter and I wantmy AccuWeather app. My husband who also has a Galaxy 5S but is much less active on some things such as the camera, gallery and the calendar feature that I use. He informed me that his likes to do random updates but that he does not have enough storage left to receive the phone update. That is probably my biggest disappointment in this phone is a 16 gb and I think it came pre-loaded with so much stuff it must have used up 10 to 12 GB although I have not verified the actual amount. I'm not sure I will keep this phone and definitely feel the pressure of my three daughters who told me in the beginning I should have gotten an iPhone. 3 stars for this Galaxy 5 which would be fine for an older person wanting a smartphone but not someone who enjoys at least 3 to 5 social media apps;there just isn't room to download it. The only way I would probably keep this phone as if I can get a 32 gig SIM card. The other things I can probably learn to live with.",2017年10月21日 在美国审核
Could not be happier; this phone is a winner!,"Could not be happier with this phone! I got it a month ago and have been playing with it ever since--and to my great surprise, those pre-installed apps I thought were just bells-and-whistles fluff turned out to be very useful--like the S Health App which measures your heart rate and tracks your steps! (I got 10,000 steps in one day and felt very proud when the icon turned gold and it played a tune and congratulated me!!)I've now had 4 Samsung phones, and this one is the best by far. Everything about it is well-thought-out and well done. I love the screen size, love the simplicity of using it, love the battery strength (it's never run down completely yet, and I use it A LOT during the day). The camera is amazing--and I'm not a visual person, so when I see shots I took with the camera and I'M impressed, that says something! The detail in these photos is spectacular; I've never seen anything like it. I'm also much relieved that the phone is water-resistant, because my last Samsung was water-damaged and never behaved quite the same way afterward.I wholeheartedly recommend this phone; I expect to be enjoying it for as long as my Verizon contract lasts.",2014年9月8日 在美国审核

"Plastic case is weak link, camera quality is tops","In the past several weeks, we've used the Samsung Galaxy S5 in Black and Electric Blue as well as the HTC One M8.The HTC audio wins hands down as does its basic appearance, but the Samsung phones are also great.This black phone is more of a dark gray than true black and the entire case is plastic, giving it a cheaper appearance.I love the Electric Blue color, but since all phones are protected by case covers, the rears are not visible anyway.Unlike the HTC, this one offers a removable battery, which along with its superior camera, are why we purchased a pair of these on Verizon Wireless.The phone arrives loaded with apps which are unnecessary and not wanted, so what we could easily remove, we did.The Health app is used daily by my daughter, I'm not as diligent myself.A weakness of this phone, particularly as compared to the HTC, is the rear speaker which muffles the audio while the phone is resting.I've found that by keeping it face down, it's easier to hear.The fingerprint security option hasn't worked well for either of us, so it's not currently being used.Samsung uses its own power port, think of a conjoined USB with a smaller twin port, the same as the Samsung tablet.In general, this is a really good phone which I expect will last the two years of our contract.",2014年7月15日 在美国审核

just as expected,"i bought a black verizon phone from wireless cloud for $125 and had for two weeks so far. description claimed that the phone was a 7+/10 with minor scratches overall. i was nervous at first to buy because it never specified if the screen was scratched and the description wasn't very good. when the phone came a day early (which i was happy about), i inspected the phone thoroughly. the screen did have very tiny scratches, but they are near invisible and hard to see or feel, especially when the screen is on. other than that, the screen was clean and flawless. the bezel edges had some nicks, but were few and very small and didn't show any scraped paint. there was also a dent in the edge of the back camera on the bezel, but also small and the lens was unaffected. the worst damage was very small and minor on the top egde with some rubbing away of the paint. since it was small it never bothered me. it came with a microUSB 2.0 charger and wall block and battery as promised. the battery looked brand new. it did say on the label it was ""manufactured by SDI"", not sure what that means but it wasn't an actual battery because i think a real one would say ""made in korea"", and the battery kind of falls out easily if the cover is off and you little hit the phone. my gs4 doesn't have this problem, so i know that maybe the battery isn't genuine, but it's ok with me since it still works ok. the battery life is a little poor, but i had this problem in the past. i can deal with it easily. but i do know that the phone and cover are genuinely from samsung. the charging port cover was completely intact and free of any damage. it pops in and out easily. other things i'd say is that the charger was brand new as well as the back cover door. also, the phone was factory reset so it didnt have any old garbage in the memory and works perfectly with no issues. the packaging was good and easy to open. overall everything was in very good condition.",2017年5月23日 在美国审核

Everything is set up on this phone in an orderly manner that makes things easy to find and use which is awesome, especially if you are a first time Android user. Lastly, the amount of customizationa available for this phone is amazing! Users can set their phones to talk to them, use Google as you would Siri for Apple, and customice greetings as well.

Samsung Galaxy S5,"I recently bought the S5 for my upgrade and am very happy with my purchase. With phones these days it always seems like your model is old and outdated a week after you get it. I do not feel this way with the S5. I've outlined some pros and cons of things I find important below.Pros:1. It's android, I personally prefer the android over apple for the flexibility and interface.2. The battery life is great! I have been able to run 2 days with moderate usage on one charge.3. The camera is really nice. With 16MP the details are great! I took this on a road trip and ended up using the camera quite a bit more than i thought.4. USB 3.0 and 2.0. I have my old micro USB charger and was worried I wouldn't be able to use it but it still fits!5. Screen size is nice. I can see and read things on the screen much easier than my old phone.Cons:1. It was actually hard to find cons but the increased size makes it difficult to fit in some of my pockets.2. It may be the size or the background noise reduction but some people have had trouble hearing me when the phone is not positioned properly.3. The front camera isn't amazing but still works fine for self portraits.4. I hardly use any default apps and they just seem to take up space.Overall, the pros are superior to the cons and I feel like I have a great phone that will last me quite some time. Very pleased with the purchase.",2015年12月8日 在美国审核

I bought the S5 when the latest and greatest from Samsung was the S6 and paid about one third of what I would have paid for a new S6.It arrived in great condition, looking almost brand new, but due to the problems I've encountered I would hesitate to buy a refurbished phone again.Here are the problems I've had.When using the phone, people on the other end have a great deal of trouble understanding me. They say my voice cuts in and out, or sounds garbled. It doesn't matter how many bars I have, the quality of the sound is often erratic on the other end. The quality is a little better when I put it on speakerphone, but it still isn't great. I thought the problem may be due to the heavy duty case I bought, but the problem persists even when I take the phone out of the case.The charging port is somewhat screwed up.Some chargers work fine with the phone, but with other chargers the phone won't charge, or the MicroUSB plug won't even fit in. The problem isn't with the chargers, because they all work fine with our tablets and other cell phone. It's only this phone that the chargers don't work with or don't fit into.The fingerprint sensor doesn't work at all. This was a feature I was really looking forward to because I like to secure all my devices but hate keying in passwords or PIN's.But I haven't been able to get the fingerprint sensor to work, either with Android or with any of the apps that accept fingerprints in lieu of a password or PIN. There's a scratch over the fingerprint sensor that I didn't notice when I first got the phone, and I'm guessing that that's the reason it doesn't work.I gave this phone three stars because I bought two of them, one for me and one for my wife. Hers works fine but mine has the problems listed above, so I would give her phone 5 stars and mine 1 star. I guess you take your chances with any refurbished device.",2016年10月9日 在美国审核

Best phone on the market according to Consumer Reports. (Feb 2015),"My new Galaxy s5 arrived before the promised date in a new box with a charger and earbuds.No Samsung manual was included so be sure to download thePDF file for the manual, it is over 250 pages and you do need it.You do need to order a sim card from your provider and then activate your service.I called Verizon to order the sim card, or you can just go to a Verizon store.You do need to start your new service plan before they will give you the new sim card.I activated the new phone online with Verizon with ease.You can transfer all of your contacts, and email quickly using the instructions from the Verizon website.I also bought a 64 gig micro SD card to add memory.The phone will take up to a 128 gig SD card.The 64 gig card is at Sam's for about $18.I am totally satisfied with my purchase from this company.",2016年9月15日 在美国审核
"Received correct product, but.....","Product that arrived was what was advertised and expected, however there were some quality issues. First, it was advertised as in good condition.It is obvious, whomever in the past that tried to get the back off the phone did not know how to do it, and their are huge chips missing on the back.There is one small chip on the screen, and when I pulled the back off it, it was filthy.Like chunks of food or nasty stuff from someone's pocket or purse that fell out of the back of the phone.Also, I had asked the seller SPECIFICALLY if this phone came with the two pronged charger like the original style that came with the phone.It DOES NOT.They included a single prong ""quick charger,"" but you can buy a new double pronged charger from other companies to fit this phone for about $7.It should have come with the original double style, because the single pronged ""quick charge"" charger is still not as fast as the double pronged.Also, there is a supposed to be a hinged closure for the double charging port on the bottom, which makes this phone water resistant.It's broken off, so if you get this phone wet, it will likely damage the phone.So--did I get a phone that works?Yes.But I had to clean it---no, make that: I had to sanitize it.Tempered glass screen protector I bought at an additional cost, minimizes the visibility of the chip.No moisture protection as comes standard with a new condition one.And a back cover that is thrashed, with chunks missing from where someone tried to open it, not knowing how and another moisture entrance point.Definitely not ""good"" condition.Still not a bad deal, however, as these phones are great, and to me, a better value for how I use a phone, and will not be around for that much longer.I have another broken version of this phone so I swapped the back out and solved the problem with the chunks missing.I did not contact the seller over these issues, as I am not confident a replacement would give me a better product, because I contacted them upfront before making the purchase and told them EXPLICITLY that I want this phone for the double pronged charging capabilities.Some things to keep in mind if you are purchasing this, and don't have a second phone from which to pull parts like I do.",2020年2月15日 在美国审核

Decent Snapshot for Most Every Ones Life,"Very solid phone, even for how old it is. I've had an extensive look into the Galaxy line up and the Galaxy S5 was perfect for me with It's magnificent camera, expandable storage, and low price point. Although there is a lacking of built in storage and wireless charging. (If that's for you) Wireless charging solutions for this phone can range from ~$5 for a wireless charging pad that gives your phone wireless charging capabilities, or up to $150 for Samsung's Equipment. The 16 GB model is slowly becoming outdated with how much storage is used for OS and built in apps. Definitely consider the 32 GB model. If it sounds like you wouldn't use that much storage then it's perfect.These are just a few personal opinions of a amateur photographer.",2016年8月24日 在美国审核

At least the software hasn't crashed yet. It will take me a while to get used to the android way. Maybe I never will.

"Great phone. only minor complaints, but nothing is perfect.","Tldr: this phone is great.I went from an LG_g2 to this phone.

Use a Samsung review guide to set it up and it'll be a great phone.I'll go straight to minor negative things so people can see that stuff. But pretty much I'm not returning it and buying a G3 so I'm clearly happy.Things I don't like:the stock keyboard. It sucks and isn't intuitive, I just downloaded Swype instead.The stock samsung messaging service. It doesn't break up the messages for Verizon (a cdma limitation) so you can't really use it on Verizon because it'll limit each message to 160 characters.The cover for the charger. It's annoying and a little old flip phone ish feeling. The tiny mechanism that keeps it closed fails pretty quickly. I suspect it'll break after a year and I'll just rip it off. This will also deplete the value of resell.The home screen doesn't carousel around. When you get to the edge of the home screen you can't rearrange things and or flip to the back of the home screens from the first. You have to scroll left or right all the way to the back. Makes it a bit annoying to get to programs I don't use frequently enough to be on the home screen or one screen over and, subsequently, I use them even less from forgetting about them.While I'm at it, there is less ability to customize the widgets and their sizes, home page layouts, and freedom to tweak in general.Also I wish the home keys were more customizable like the lg had been.

People complain that I keep cutting in and out all the time so calls are a nightmare.The auto brightness drains the battery so fast that even if I hardly use it,I would have to charge my phone halfway though the day. I ended up just turning it off.The camera is complete junk. This made me very mad. One of the reasons why I got this phone is because I had heard good things about it. All my pictures turn out horrible and unfocused. I have changed the settings so many times and read lots of article in hopes to get better picture, but im pretty sure it's the camera. It seems like the camera never wants to focus right and it has a really hard time taking pictures in the house unless I have all the lights on. So my pictures are mostly blurry,too dark, or both no matter how i change the settings. I have a 1 year old son and it's sad that 90% of my pictures are trash.Last but not least and probably pissed me off the most. 3 days after the return date expired my phone started getting really hot and freezing up to the point where I had to pull the battery.I have only had this happen to me with one other phone and that phone was a refurbished pile of junk.Beware the seller I got it from was: Cell2URLess",2017年3月26日 在美国审核

This is annoying. They upgraded the whole Android operating system to ...,"The phone has worked perfectly for 6 months. Issues with the Android OS.Last week Android/Google automatically added several apps that cannot be removed as an upgrade without asking first. This is annoying. They upgraded the whole Android operating system to Lollipop and some features changed that I preferred under the previous version. I had to set new backgrounds, color schemes, settings and other minor issues that were time consuming to deal with to return the phone as close to previous settings as I could. There are likely more issues I don't know about. They reset fonts; so small a magnifying glass would not have helped - the font settings had to be reset.Why not install a new OS that maintains prior settings? Even Microsoft does that.I am not a fan of Google, but am also not a fan of the iPhone. So overall, I love the Samsung phone but the Android/Google OS eaves a little to be desired. In its favor, Android has a far superior selection of apps.",2015年4月19日 在美国审核
Better than the iPhone? Heck yes.,"While it says two day shipping, the phone wasn't shipped until my account was processed, so you might end up waiting a day or two extra before it ships. I was patient, and I'm glad. It's one hell of a deal getting such an amazing phone for just a penny under a new contract.I've been using the iPhone since the very first one. I swore I would never touch another phone brand other than Apple. But over the years, the more phones they released, the less impressed I became. It was basically the same phone being released over the years with a few tweaks to the UI and some nice, but mostly trivial additions.The Galaxy S5 has me feeling the same way I did when I got my first smartphone. The way multitasking with multiple apps is handled is superb. I was getting sick of switch between apps in the iOS when I needed to get stuff done.Overall, if you're interested in the Galaxy phones, I'd say the S5 is a great way to start. The Galaxy S6, while visually appealing, turned me off with their glass back cover and lack of SD card slot/removable battery.Either way, I'm now a happy Samsung customer and fan.",2015年4月15日 在美国审核

Verizon messed this phone up with carrier changes,"I have an S5 through AT&amp;T as my work provided phone and an S5 through VZW as my personal phone. On my VZW phone, which this order was for, every time Facebook updates, the entire phone force closes every app that is currently open, resets the wallpaper to stock and reverts back to the home screen. My AT&amp;T S5 does not do this. The home screens also do not rotate all the way around 360 degrees like my AT&amp;T S5 does, because Verizon disabled this feature. I'm guessing because they want some other app to do this? Who knows, carrier specific changes to Android don't make sense to the consumer.Otherwise, it's about what I expected. It has a fair quick response time between apps/home screen, phone camera is pretty decent, easy to close any open and orphaned apps, the pedometer and heart rate monitor are nice features and I like unlocking my phone with a quick swipe of my thumb. This was the last GSx phone to have removable/expandable memory as of late 2015, so I may have to jump ship as a loyal Samsung mobile user if new Galaxy phones continue to force the user to use Cloud backup.",2015年11月2日 在美国审核

Many Apps cannot deal with it correctly. So it gets crowded in the 16GB internal memory.- Lots of useless pre-installed apps that cannot be uninstalled, is a security risk and wastes resource.

Tips for battery drain and extending battery life,"This phone has been reviewed to death, so I will not bother reviewing all the small details. I did, however, notice that no reviews mention wakelocks, so I would like to take a moment to discuss those. I will also tie this into the battery and battery life.At home, my S5 has amazing battery life. I consistently get nearly 6 hrs. of screen on time with a single charge. However, at school (a large university) my battery life takes a nose dive while on wifi. A tl;dr explanation of what is happening is that the android operating system has a bug where busy wifi networks are able to wake your phone up while it is sleeping (keyword: wake locks). This means your phone cannot go into a consistent ""deep sleep"" after you lock your phone and it will continue to drain your battery even when you're not using it. Feel free to google it for more info, but as of now, there is no fix. A quick fix for me was to download an app called MacroDroid. I set it so that when I am connected to my university network and I lock the screen, it will automatically shut the wifi off. When I turn the screen back on, the wifi is turned on automatically. Disclaimer: I am running kitkat right now, lollipop may or may not fix this issue.Related to this is a problem my S5 seems to have when I change specific things. For example, both after installing a microSD card and syncing my text messages from my old iphone to my current phone, the phone would not go into a deep sleep. I was able to fix these issues by clearing my phones cache and clearing the cache for the associated apps. I've always been able to fix this issue, but I feel like it shouldn't be happening at all in the first place.If anyone cares to know, I will describe how to prolong your battery life below, both on a day to day basis and its lifetime overall.To extend day to day battery life:1. I immediately turned off all gestures (apparently they can get toggled while the phone is in your pocket and use up battery?)2. Turn off location unless I'm using it3. Disabled all the random apps that come preloaded on the phone and you can't deleteIf you are having issues with your phone's battery life, try using Greenify, which will let you hibernate apps that may use up battery with one click. You can also download an app called ""System Monitor"" (the Lite version is free and works fine for this purpose) and you can use it to monitor the CPU speed on your S5. If, while the phone is locked, the phone is not in ""deep sleep,"" something is wrong and it will cause your battery to die faster than it should.Note: The first time you turn on the phone and as the phone is installing all the initial updates, the battery will probably drain very fast. This is only because the phone has been off for a long time and the calibration (so to speak) will be a little off. After you charge your phone completely it should go back to a normal discharge rate.To extend the overall lifetime of your phone's battery:1. Do not leave it in your car when it is very hot (&gt; 80F) or very cold (&lt;35F). It can do irreversible damage to the battery.2. Limit the number of charge/discharge cycles. I.e. charge your phone when you have to. The best thing to do would be to only charge it once it's below about 20%, and when you do charge it, charge it all the way up. Unplugging it as soon as it reaches 100% is recommended.3. Don't leave it at a low % charge for a long time, it's unhealthy for Li-ion batteries.There is no need to ""cycle"" your battery (you do that with Ni-Cad batteries).Other than that, it's a really nice phone and being samsung's ""flag ship,"" there are a lot of available accessories for it. I am using the Spigen Slim Armor case and really like it. I also would highly recommend a tempered glass screen protector, it has a much better feel than a plastic screen protector.Lastly, I had no issue switching from an iphone 4 to this phone. It took a bit to get used to, but I was quick to realize the many new benefits. The new screen was daunting at first, but my hands are big enough to hold it, and it is a lot easier to use and see.",2015年1月14日 在美国审核

My phone slipped from the sofa to the floor, which was approximately 1.5' distance. And the lens shattered into a zillion pieces. Yes, it is glass. Yes, glass breaks. But why on earth put an extremely fragile piece of thin glass in such a vulnerable location? It's absurd.

Fabulous phone!,"Fabulous phone! I supplemented its 16gb of memory with a 32gb sim card. Available memory (my biggest gripe with my old phone) feels unlimited. Brilliant display, lightening fast. Love the increased size of the phone. Almost a mini tablet but not too big to comfortably carry in your pocket. Purchased the Otterbox Defender case and am very pleased with it. The heath app has permanently replaced my Fitbit (which had become unreliable after only a year). My only (minor) criticism is the fussy cover over the charger port.

Good Camera. Reception for phone signal is strong,"Have had this phone about 3 weeks now. It's exactly what it should be. Fast. Good Camera. Reception for phone signal is strong. GPS is quick to acquire. Battery life is good (I'm not a heavy phone user but I think it would be decent even if I was). Feels solid. Charges quickly. Screen is crisp and looks great.The only two negatives: For some with small hands this may not be the ideal phone. I mean, it's not a huge phone and not unmanageable -- and I am happy with it -- just saying that if I were advising a friend I'd say to at least think about the ""mini"" version of this.The predictive word choice drove me crazy with how bad it was and how it corrected me. I've turned it off for now. Probably need to find a better keyboard app for my tastes / style.",2014年9月28日 在美国审核
Not enough memory- full to the brim with bloatware,"Even with a large SD memory card, this phone quickly ran out of memory, to the point where I can't even update my apps. I've installed far fewer apps than in my previous android phones, and moved every possible app to the card memory, and use the memory card for all my photos, music, and anything else I can. I still have plenty of room on my memory card, and I only use the internal memory when I have no other choice, such as certain critical or unmovable apps, and system functionsBut even with this minimal use of internal memory, it's full, to the point where my apps can't update, and the phone bugs me every single day to update the android software, but it can't since there's no room to do so. The reason is the phone is filled to the brim with useless bloatware, which you cannot uninstall. I tried to root the phone but it was too late, a small android update blocked that ability. So the phone is crippled to the point of being defective.It's a shame because the hardware is great- the camera and battery life are better than any phone I've ever had, the GPS works well, and the performance overall is great. Why they would ruin all that by putting so little memory in, and filling all of that with bloatware, is beyond me.. I bought this phone specifically because it was the last Galaxy that had a removeable battery and memory card, even though the S6 was already released, but it looks like I'll have to find another option soon, even though this phone is just a few months old..",2015年8月28日 在美国审核
Great phone. After the updates to Android 5,Great phone. After the updates to Android 5.0 it does seem a little more sluggish and force closes a bit more. It can be annoying at times but the benefits out way it. I purchased the Anker batteries for it and just swap between batteries. I've had no issues with compatibility and the Anker batteries actually last longer than the original Samsung battery. The screen resolution is great. The fact that you can swap batteries and add micro SD cards are a big plus. The fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor can be a little frustrating at times.,2015年4月29日 在美国审核

An oldie but a goodie,"It feels a little funny to be writing a review on a phone that is now two generations old, but it seems people are still interested, so why not.I purchased my 16GB Galaxy S5 used to replace an LG G3 that had stopped working properly.I had actually come down to choosing between the S5 and the LG back when I got my Verizon upgrade in 2014, so moving to the S5 when I gave up on the LG seemed very natural.For the most part, I consider the used S5 I purchased to be a great phone.The size is great.The display is great.I actually find the buttons to be more convenient and more intuitive than on other phones I've owned.I was concerned that Samsung/Verizon weren't going to continue supporting the S5, but the Marshmallow update became available very shortly after I received my phone.The amount of bloatware on the S5 seems slightly worse than on the Motorola and LG phones I've owned in the past, but I suppose if that really bothered me that much I could install a custom ROM and eliminate all of it.My most significant complaint with regard to the S5 has to do with the forward facing camera.It is, in a word, meager.Compared to the G3, it plain old stinks.That's not at all a deal breaker for me; I use the camera to record lifting sessions from time to time to ensure my form is still good, and I can do that just fine with the S5 camera, but the first time I used it and realized how bad the image looked in comparison to the G3, I was stunned.Still, for the money, I consider the S5 -- particularly a gently used S5 -- to be a high value purchase.",2016年6月7日 在美国审核

"This was a flagship phone a few years ago, and still holds up as a very competitive phone in 2016.","I really wanted to love it, but in the end, like is as far as I can go.It really is a deal in the smartphone universe - Android 6, 2GB RAM, nice screen, fast CPU, for not a lot of money.So it has a lot going for it, honestly.However, it has some quirks that my Galaxy Note 3 (an older phone than the S5) did not have.Specifically, the OTG functionality is very buggy, mostly not working at all.Exact same cables and devices work fine on the Note3.The fingerprint scanner is pretty picky, almost always takes me 2 or 3 tries to get it to work (in fairness, the note3 had no scanner), and it seems to be a little glitchy in it's SD card functionality (sometimes it takes it 2 or 3 minutes after a reboot to figure out it has one).Otherwise, a pretty solid phone, that works in Canada (the verizion locked Note3 would not).For the relatively inexpensive price, I am satisfied, it is a capable smartphone, in my opinion, much nicer than similarly priced phones that are currently on the market.However, were it not for the fact that I use MHL and a cable to watch Amazon video on my TV, I would have bought a Google Nexus 5x instead (Nexus only supports ChromeCast or similar, no 'real cable' hookups, and my experience with Amazon Video and CC and similar is that the quality sucks on non-cabled methods - more the fault of Amazon Video than the hardware).Update:Had this phone about 2 months now, and the screen cracked (and I didn't do anything even close to what I feel could be expected to cause such damage).So, minus one more star.In fairness, it's just a hairline crack that doesn't affect usability (can't even see it from normal viewing angles).However, in many years of using various smart phones, this is the first phone I've ever had a cracked screen with.My wife has the same phone, and her screen is also similarly cracked (has been for over a year now, though still not affecting use of her phone).She has never cracked the screen on any other phone either, and she has been using smartphones for years also.Both of us use mil-spec (drop tested) cases, and neither of us are hard on phones (ie: we're not dropping them on a regular basis).So I have to conclude, that the screen on this model is a bit wimpy as compared to other models.",2016年9月21日 在美国审核

Hope this review helps anyone who is thinking of purchasing this phone or anything from this seller. Just keep scrolling. :),"After using this phone for about a year, I am not satisfied with this product. When I first received it, I found a small dent near the corner of the front screen. Everything else was good, but that dented corner. I put a case on it and a screen protective, but overtime the battery life of the phone got shorter on a day to day basis. A few days ago, I picked up my phone after charging it that morning, and saw that the LCD screen broke. At first glance it looks completely fine, but after turning my phone on, the screen wouldn't light up. I took the phone to Best Buy, and they claimed that the phone had a defect when shipped from the third party seller, but it was not noticeable then. They explained that overtime, the screen condition was worsening. Please save your time, energy, and money. I am now looking into cheap phones under $300 at Best Buy, even thought those phones may be cheaper at Amazon. I will never buy phones or any electronics from third party sellers.",2017年6月11日 在美国审核

Nopesville population: This phone,"I've been a long time iPhone user and made the switch this year primarily because I was sick of the battery issues I was having with my iPhone 5 (that Apple conveniently acknowledge right after I switched and well beyond the one year warranty mark) I also have to support Apple gear for my job (I work in IT and have to manage roughly 700 desktops/laptops) So when I say I hate Apple with a passion, it comes with legitiment reasons given their lack of enterprise support and the fact that they make my life so hard.That being said this is a review of an Android. So how could I hate this product more than my Apple product? Easy. This is the dumbest smartphone I've had the stupidity to buy.You want an audio nanny! You got one! I don't ever wear headphones and use this primarily via the aux port in my car to stream radio. The phone WILL NOT remember your previous audio settings and unless you change a setting will give you an annoying warning every single time about listening to music too loud!You want a phone with more apps than you can shake a stick at? Done. Seriously, I've never in my life seen a phone so loaded with so much useless garbage. Why do I need two email clients just so I can check gmail and yahoo? WHYYYYY? Further to the point the required gmail client isn't even fully featured and wont display when you've got new mail. SOOOOO bad.You want a phone that fights you every step of the way and doesn't put anything in places that make sense? Here ya go. I've never had so much trouble trying to find simple settings such as trying to figure out how to adjust push pull options for something like Yahoo mail. I've never had to spend HOURS on google trying to figure out where something is located or how to do a task on a phone. This phone has induced more rage than trying to watch your favorite football team on Sunday on a satellite dish in heavy rain!The funny thing is, all of the Android owners around me were like you've finally switched! How is it? And when I tell them I hate it, and start to list all the reasons why, they are all like oh... yeah... your right about that. !!!! Seriously, I spent over 45 minutes detailing why this phone sucks to my brother in law and he didn't have a single counter, not one!Oh and for all that talk about this being a USB 3 device? LOL. You have to go into airplane mode to even use it and when you do it still isn't near as fast as even a traditional external drive.All that being said, there are two positive things about this phone, One: I don't have to use iTunes to sync files to my phone (flips off Apple). Two: it has an expandable storage which means I can add another 128gb to phone with a micro sd card for cheap compared to buying a phone with huge space and huge markups to boot.

"I use mine for, Mp3, video, games, and in an emergency 911","So, in an age of planned obsolescence, my original Galaxy S5 I had until the S8+ came out, and to the day I traded it in I regretted it. So eventually I bought a new one. Off Amazon. Came in a whatever cardboard lunch bag looking box. (I bought mine a year or two ago). And a USB Micro cable and I think a Samsung charger I don't remember if it included headphones. My original one did but Samsung doesn't deal in Aux anymore.So some things to know:This phone can take USB 3.0 via USB Micro-B (21 pin data cable)Can use Samsung Fast Charge and I just used my Super Fast Charger on it (Used USBC to female A adapter)Aux port, Micro SD Card up to 128, however, it can take a 256gb but you'll lose some of the gigs, keep that in mind. Changable battery, and bluetooth. Andriod beam, bluetooth data sharing (so pictures, mp3s, videos)So, why do I have this in 2021? When I first got mine in 2013? It has 2gb of ram and 16gb built in memory. (if you can find the 32gb memory with 3gb ram go for it that little bit helps sometimes) Simple, it's my Mp3 player, video player, and I can play games on it (offline since I don't want to connect it to the internet).When you're going somewhere using your phone for GPS, streaming music, videos, online games etc. That uses a lot more battery on phones. And if you're without power you're basically F'd to some degree. Even Gen X has trouble remembering how to read a map. And if you need to call for emergency services? Oh, you're really F'd.So my Galaxy s5 is a little media player and if I need to, I can call 911 without it being on a phone plan. I have a Bluetooth controller for games, wired headphones (seriously uses less battery than Bluetooth btw) And honestly, this thing is a great size. It's almost the perfect size tbh. I love it. With that said, I've never had to call 911 on this, thank God",2021年4月16日 在美国审核

S3 to S5: nice upgrade! UPDATE.,"I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to the Galaxy S5. There were several key improvements that made the switch worthwhile.1. Waterproofing. I'm a photojournalist and occasionally get caught in the rain. I'm reassured that my expensive phone won't get trashed even if I get soggy as a flounder. Also, do you know how many people drop their phones in toilets, pools or puddles? It's a LOT! You need to seal the charging port with an annoying little flap at the bottom, though, which makes finding a desktop charging cradle problematic.2. Larger / better screen. I'm a big guy and really like a decent-sized phone. Plus I use Google Maps while driving so a tiny screen just doesn't cut it. The S5 screen is slightly larger and sharper than the excellent S3 screen; great for reading eBooks and watching movies and useable even in daylight.3. Astonishing battery life! When I first bought the S5, I was lucky to get a full day off a charge. But in September there was a big firmware update (4.4.4--now 5.0 Lollipop) which increased the battery life dramatically! I leave just about everything running, yet an astonishing 80-90% battery power remains after 14 hours!Furthermore the new ""Ultra Power Saving Mode"" is an emergency option that shuts down all but the basic communication functions while extending the last gasp of battery life for DAYS. This could be a literal life saver.The S5 charges faster with its new USB 3 charger, but it also charges with standard legacy USB 2 chargers. No funky adapter needed; REALLY nice engineering tweak!4. Camera. The camera in the new S5 is far better than the S3's camera. I was startled at its quality and ability to shoot under low light.5. Snappy operation / Using Verizon. The new processor makes the S5 a bit snappier than the S3. Sometimes I use Verizon's Mobile Office to link my laptop to the internet when working in the field. Verizon is awfully expensive, but they have a superior system, especially during emergencies like hurricanes and power outages. Lesson verified during Ike and Katrina.CONS:Of course, Verizon loads their usual loathsome crapware on your new phone; this junk cannot be uninstalled. Furthermore, Samsung felt free to shovel its own steaming pile on top of Verizon's. And watch out for the Google+ app. One setting automatically uploads your photos into the cloud, which can be disastrous away from WiFi on a limited data plan.Neat phone, though, with some spiffy advanced software. Many of the software upgrades are useless, but I quite like the feature that keeps the screen active if it ""sees"" your face with the front camera. Also, I like the NFC sensor. I bought a five-pack of Samsung's TecTiles and downloaded the free ""NFC Task Launcher"" to program the tiles to perform various tedious tasks--like turning off WiFi and turning on Bluetooth when getting into the car. Another one fires up Google Maps while boosting screen brightness.The S3 is a fine device, so don't feel you must upgrade. But the S5 has several distinct improvements and, if you cell plan allows, it is worth it.UPDATE: After many months of reliable service, the annoying little bottom flap needed for S5 for waterproofing broke off. Replacement flaps are available for less than two bucks.",2014年8月14日 在美国审核

Tips on an Excellent Phone and its Camera,"I finally decided to step out of the dark ages and upgraded from a ""dumb phone"" to a Verizon Samsung Galaxy S5 ""smart phone"". I had resisted that move for several years, thinking that my Verizon phone bill would increase by another $40-50 over the $105 which I was already paying for their base plan. Stopping by Verizon to troubleshoot a minor malfunction of my LG dumb phone, I asked how much an upgrade phone would cost me and was shocked to find out that my total phone bill would drop to $60 per month by switching to a smart phone. Wow. No brainer and took the plunge.I am very impressed with this phone. The camera is simply amazing. I took some night shots at an outdoor concert and the image was as if it were still daylight outside. Also took shots of family around a campfire and they came out just as the eye would see them. Not grainy and good detail. My biggest complaint about the camera is the inability to capture images of children moving. They blur. I wish there was a manual ""high shutter speed"" option to override the auto function. If there is, I have not been able to find it by exploring all of the settings and options. The other negative to the camera that you need to be aware of... is the delay or lag time, from the time you press the ""shoot"" button, until the image is actually captured. You will miss some precious moments such as the look on a child's face sometimes. I understand though that you can shoot video and then screen capture a specific moment in the video, to accomplish precise photo saves. Haven't learned houw to do that yet. My digital daughters are going to show me.Other than that, the quality of the photos are better than all of the point and shoot cameras that I have owned over the years, although I never took the plunge for a Nikon or Canon digital SLR. The colors are precise, bright and overall fantastic. I had no idea what I was missing by not having a great camera on my person at all times, in the form of this phone.There are so many features on this phone and options to customize and control what the phone does, that the learning curve is fairly extensive and you will want to sit down and literally click through every level and every pop-up menu to see what can be done with programs, features, and settings. The phone does not come with a manual (only a quick start guide which doesn't tell you much) so be sure you download the extensive PDF manual from Samsung's website and store it on your PC, or laptop. I haven't tried storing it on my phone yet, but might be a good idea for when away from home.There is a fingerprint scanner which can unlock the phone. I tried it at first but found it to be extremely erratic. After it registered my thumb print and index fingerprint, it worked a couple of attempts, but I went back to the phone an hour later and it continually gave me an error message to try again. So I disabled that feature and find it easier to simply swipe the pattern on the 9 dot field.As you obviously know, by reading the product page features, is that this phone is water resistant and you can actually drop it into water (submersed), as long as it is not very deep (in which water pressure starts to have an impact, such as going 4-6 feet deep into a swimming pool). Great piece of mind for potential of dropping into the sink, running through the washing machine by accident, etc. It is officially rated to 1 to 2 feet deep, so I considered buying the LifeProof case which has better water depth protection, but there were an abundance of negative reviews for that case for this phone....which causes severe echo on phone conversations. I did buy the Otterbox Defender which is absolutely fantastic for this phone, for additional shock drop protection, cosmetic protection, and a screen protection which so far has been as scratch resistant as the best selling screen protector, ""Invisible Shield"", by Zagg (which seems to be the default choice for most purchasers). Subsequently, I discovered that Otterbox has the ""Preserver"" case which is waterproof, for about 50 bucks more than the Defender. Wish I had known that before. Probably would have bought it instead. But extremely happy with the Defender since I don't plan on taking it deep sea diving or snorkeling.I love the keyboard and am just now learning to swipe with predictive text and have found it to be very accurate and instantaneous. I am a fast touch typist (not hunt and peck) so I find this to be an excellent addition to my speed ability, being able to ""type"" with a single finger gliding ""sloppily"" across the keyboard to desired letters along the way. And the keyboard is large enough when you use the phone in landscape orientation, to be very comfortable,and increasing its accuracy.One minor weakness in my opinion is that the ringtones and alerts are not very loud and I often miss an incoming call if the phone is more than about 10 feet away. The volume level should be much higher on the higher setting.Another irritation was that after I selected my desired ""notifications ringtone"", I was getting constant sound alerts, every few minutes, when the only time I wanted to be alerted was to inbound text messages and phone calls. It took 3 different Verizon reps, before I got to one that was Samsung knowledgeable, who could troubleshoot and disable notifications which were happening on every email and junk mail, arriving constantly into my gmail account. We discovered that you have to disable notifications in not only gmail (icon) on the phone's ""Apps"" screen but also realize that you have to do the same within the Android icon for email messages which looks like a piece of yellow notebook paper coming out of an envelope. I thought disabling notifications within gmail on the phone would do it, but the phone was also alerting me because the same messages appear within this App.After getting the phone,I realized that the 16gb of onboard memory could be chewed up pretty fast with media, such as videos of family, photographs, and my extensive music library, so I searched for high capacity micro SD cards to install in the S5. Although the Sandisk was considered, I noted a number of negative reviews in which their card had flaws which had to be addressed by Sandisk's customer support (which by the way, appeared to be very proactive on Amazon, by addressing each 1 or 2 star review with a request for the reviewer to contact Sandisk support for a resolution to their problem...bravo to them for caring enough to monitor negative reviews).At any rate, there seems to be somewhat universal problems encountered with these higher capacity cards, in older devices, depending upon what file format the Android devices run on (in their software)..i.e. FAT32 vs. exFat (which is on newer devices). Fat32 PC's and mobile devices will not recognize cards above 32gb. Many people running software with FAT32 have been advised to reformat the 32 and 64gb cards in their mobile device so that the device recognizes the card and can then mount it successfully. So, not being a computer geek who understands the technical aspects of all this, I was a little bit hesitant, so I decided that if I have a Samsung S5 phone that the seemingly logical thing to do would be to purchase the Samsung 64gb card instead of the Sandisk. I figured there would most likely be a higher degree of probable compatibility with the phone, being from the same manufacturer.Bottom line is that I inserted the Samsung 64gb Evo card into the S5, and it immediately recognized the card and also gave me a screen pop up indicating that any new pictures taken on the device would automatically default to storage on the card instead of storing on my phone's internal memory, which is exactly what I wanted to do. Then I fired up the camera and shot several pictures and each one showed the little SD card icon in the bottom right of my screen, indicating that the new shots went to the card for storage. Now all I need to do is to figure out how to move the shots I have already taken, from the S5 internal storage to the card.As a footnote, SD and microSD cards, and flash drives can definitely corrupt at a future date, because I have had it happen to me on 2 Sandisk flash drives, losing everything I had stored on them, so I highly recommend that you use Google+ for backup storage of media. It does not cost any extra and your device will send your media to Google for backup, automatically whenever you are powered up. Also be sure to go into Settings on your device and select the option to backup to Google, only when you are connected to WiFi (such as at home), so that the backup action does not eat into your data plan. I found out the hard way that backing up by ""through the air""internet connection on my phone, without being connected to the internet by WiFi) quickly used (added) an initial 1.5 gig of data, for just 2 short videos and about 20 photos shot during the first weekend I had the phone, which backed up automatically, in the absence of ""backup only when connected to WiFi"". Hopefully this 64gb card will not corrupt in the future. Time will tell.All in all, I am extremely pleased with this excellent phone from Samsung. Besides that, I do not have to endure any more teasing and complaining from my 5 daughters, about me being in the dark ages with my old LG slider phone. I could never make out photos that they would text to me and I certainly could not watch videos they would post on Glide or other video sharing apps. They think I just became 20 years younger.Buy this phone. No regrets.",2014年10月13日 在美国审核

This is an awesome phone. I've never had any problems with it,"This is an awesome phone.I've never had any problems with it.It's super fast and responsive.The screen resolution is excellent and it takes better pictures than my FIL's $1,900 Sony camera.I do have one gripe about what I consider to be an internal design flaw.In the event of a relatively low drop from about 3 ft directly on it's front my friend had the S5 screen go blank.It wouldn't respond to touch and was completely blank.He asked me to look at it since it already had a small crack in in the corner of the screen and he couldn't get it warrantied.You cannot access the display connectors on these phones from the back.You have to remove the screen.Using a hotplate, I warmed the display and gently separated the screen from the body.I found that the display connector had come unplugged from the drop.I plugged it back in and the display was working again.Why in the world would Samsung make a phone where the connector is inaccessible like this and where there's enough space for it to pop free!!!A simple piece of foam on the connector or the back of the screen would completely solve this issue.A quick search shows several others having this same issue.Some were able to get warranty coverage while others had to pay almost $200 to get them fixed.It's really a simple repair that took 10 minutes.Anyway...It's an awesome phone and I recommend it to everyone but don't drop it on its face!!!",2014年9月22日 在美国审核
Best Smartphone out there...,"Let me start by saying that I WAS an iPhone user, but I would not waste my time with Apple ever again. Samsung did things right, not perfectly in all ways, but this phone is light years ahead of Apple. For starters, switching over to Android is made dirt simple and quick by using SmartSwitch. All of my music, contacts, notes, etc., was copied over to my S5 quick and easy. Yes, there is some issues with Android Kitkat not permitting third party apps not being able to write to the SD expansion card, but the Samsung ""My Files"" app makes it easy to get around that limitation without rooting the phone. Many apps can still be stored on the SD card saving device memory. The choices you get and the versatility you get with the Android makes this phone a much better option than buying an iPhone. I recently purchased a usb slave cable which makes let's the S5 use an external keyboard, hard drive, or flash drive with ease and I love the added capacity for file handling. At $100 for a contract phone, why shell out big $$ for a lesser phone with a degraded experience. The coolest smartphone is not the iPhone.",2014年10月24日 在美国审核
"Great phone, holds up to the test of time","Great phone, had it almost 2 years before I upgraded. Camera is nice and sharp, feels good in the hand and is very snappy performance wise. It's waterproof, which is a must if you work or play in rough environments or wet weather. It still holds up well aside from the battery life degrading over time, which is normal with any smart phone or other electronic device. I'd highly recommend it even now that it's a few years old to anyone looking for a good dependable phone with good specs. The build is solid, it's survived drops, weather and kids. The screen is nice and bright and has no scratches after all the time I've had it. The user interface is standard Samsung, though you can turn off the magazine feature unlike the tablets Samsung produces. Expandable memory is always a plus too, it seems like many phone companies dropped that feature for a while, but I had a 64gb sd card for movies and music and extraneous app data that prevented that awful message about phone memory being full.

Careful of the Cash,"The phone is great!!! however the reason for the star is the lack of transparency in the real costs. I originally bought the phone through Amazon for $79. This was a good price given Verizon wanted $179 for the same phone. This would have been OK but for two problems the first is the phone price dropped to $1 the day after I purchased it and I had to spend an hour convincing Amazon customer service to honor that price- luckily a discussion with a supervisor did the trick. The other problem is that Verizon charges a mysterious ""Upgrade Fee"" of $35 for what I don't really know. My service was already 4G before buying the phone and after a few calls to Verizonthey still can't explain what exactly is going on- but for some reason they know it is correct ;( One more thing, the upgrade fee is charged for any phone no matter where it is purchased- wife bought an apple phone at a Verizon store and the same junk fee showed up.",2014年12月10日 在美国审核

No BS Apple move.The feel of the phone is the best of the series. Yes it's plastic but it is definitely more upscale feeling to the touch while maintaining a light weight, and aesthetically both the front and back look great.The screen is the best I've ever seen on a smartphone, crisp, colorful, and bright.The camera is an important feature for me and I'm happy to say it doesn't disappoint - it's fast, takes great photos, the live HDR mode is awesome as well. The only thing i'm not sold on is the 16:9 aspect ratio being the only mode at 16mp. You can do a standard 4:3 aspect but at 12mp. But still not necessarily bad since mega pixels don't mean much compared to the actual sensor used.The speaker is loud and clear, reception for both the phone and wifi is great too. Better than my S3 with the 4.3 update, on that note Kit Kat is awesome!One last note, the IP67 rating/ water resistance and dust resistance is an amazing and welcome feature.In summation:If you're coming from an S3 then your contract is probably up this year, and this is an amazing upgrade to a phone I loved. It really wasn't even a question for me. Size, aesthetics, features, adding your own memory, and still being able to replace your own battery made this a clear choice over the HTC M8, and others.",2014年4月14日 在美国审核
Great but not Perfect!,"I bought the S5 less than two months ago through Verizon, not Amazon.One of the selling points is that the phone is water and dust resistant.The USB port comes with a little flap plug attached to the phone by a rubber or plastic pin.To charge the phone, this plug is pulled aside, then replaced after charging.In less than two months, the plug attachment broke.Calls to Verizon resulted in the following: They told me I needed to contact Samsung directly.I told them that I did not buy the phone from Samsung.They agreed to call Samsung directly while I was on hold.When they came back on, they told that Samsung said that this problem was phone damage and not manufacturer defect.The fix would be done at my cost.Verizon said that they would change me $300 if I sent the phone back to them.I don't believe this dust cover is critical to the enjoyment of the phone, but it is discouraging to think that Samsung should sell a phone for $600 with such a manufacturer defect, and that Verizon refused to go to bat for a customer.",2014年5月9日 在美国审核
Excellent phone with great features,"Pros-1. Beautiful display.2. Great performance.3. Battery life has been improved.4. Improved design.5. Premium camera with lots of features.Cons-1. The interface still feels cluttered.2. A lot of bloatware and redundancy.3. Only 16 GB of internal storage.Having used the Samsung Galaxy S5 for over a month the best description I can use for it is that is it a jack of all trades. This is a phone that does everything really, really well but it is not the best at any one thing. The phone itself is fantastic and I hope this review will help you decide whether it is right one for you.DISPLAYThe Galaxy family of phones has always had very attractive displays. The Galaxy S5 is no exception. The screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution with a pixel density of 432. This makes texts and pictures incredibly sharp. It is very useful for people that like to read a lot on their phones. No more blurry texts. But it is not the resolution that makes the display special but the fact that it is a Super AMOLED screen. What does that mean? Well Super AMOLED have very saturated colors that look beautiful. The colors look slightly unrealistic but there is no denying that they are attractive. AMOLED screens also has higher contrast than its competition. Compare a Galaxy S5 screen to an LG or HTC and you will instantly notice the difference. It really makes pictures and videos come to life.The only thing I do not like about the display is that it is not very bright. If you are under direct sunlight you have to increase the brightness all the way up in order to distinguish anything. Even then videos are very difficult to watch under sunlight.PERFORMANCEThe Galaxy S5 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 2 GB of Ram. This phone comes with latest version of android which is Kit Kat 4.4.2. This is the most secure, stable, and smooth version of android. The processor makes the phone feel fast and the phone can handle just about everything that you throw at it. With this phone you don’t have to worry about how many applications you have opened or whether or not it is going to freeze. Samsung has been refining and perfecting multitasking the last few years. In the S5 you can run two applications at the same time without any lag or stutters. I have 4 home screens with 5 widgets running at the same time and I still can’t get this phone to lag. As far as gaming is concerned, you can be confident that this phone can handle any game available in the Play Store right now without any problem. Games load fast and the performance is very smooth. I have absolutely no complains about performance.DESIGNThe Galaxy S5 is made of plastic. There is no way around that. However, the back texture of the phone is much better than the one found on the S4, S3, and S2. Those phones were fingerprint magnets. After a few minutes of use without a case they would become an oily mess. That is not the case with the S5. The S5 does not collect fingerprint. The back of the device has a dimple texture that has grown on me. I am not a huge fan of the color selection of the phone but the navy blue model looks great.The phone has a 5.1 inch display. The phone is pretty big. One handed use is not impossible but it is hard. I am a fan of the fingerprint scanner on the S5. What I don’t like is the fact that you have to slide your finger in order to scan your finger. The IPhone 5S version of the fingerprint sensor is much more convenient when you are using the phone with one hand. The phone itself is comfortable to hold for long periods of time and it provides a pretty good grip. I am using the phone without a case and I don’t fear dropping the phone. I was using an LG G2 a few months ago and I was terrified of holding it without a case. It was much more slippery.Another improvement the S5 has over the S4 is that it is now water and dust resistant. The back plate has a thin rubber border on the inside that prevents water from coming in. Now the phone is NOT water proof. It will with stand the occasional water splash and maybe the unfortunate drop on the toilet. But don’t go in the pool or the beach with it. Water will eventually go in and ruin the phone.On the back of the phone below the camera there is also a heartbeat monitor. Personally I do not like it simply because it is not practical. You have to be standing really still and on a quiet environment for it to work properly. That is not exactly ideal when you are trying to use while jogging. However, when it is use properly under the right conditions I found it to be very accurate. It is a shame it is so nitpicky when it comes to its terms of use. Overall, I am happy with the design and hardware improvements.USER INTERFACE AND APPSLike I mentioned before the S5 is running android 4.4.2 Kit Kat. However, in order to differentiate their phones from other android offerings they are running a layer on top of android called Touch Wiz. As a whole Touch Wiz is a mixed bag. I like what they do with the notification area. They have many shortcut toggles on the notification area that allows for easy access to the main connections settings such as Wifi, Bluetooth, GPS, Data and more. They allow you to customize the order of the toggles as well as add or remove some of them.Where Touch Wiz gets a bit confusing is in the settings menu. For some reason, Samsung decided to have the menu settings laid out as colored bubble toggles in the setting menu. The toggles color scheme follow no discernable pattern. Even though the toggles are grouped by categories it feels disorganized. Fortunately, they decided to include a search bar at the top that lets you easily find the setting you are looking for. It reminds me of the search bar on Windows 8. It really is useful for beginners.Samsung includes a lot of their apps along with their phones. Most of the app offered by Samsung are redundant and generally inferior versions of apps found on the Google Play Store. For example, they include a virtual assistant called S Voice that is supposed to help you schedule appointments, search for the weather and look up web searches. Unfortunately, it is very slow and half the time I did not get the desired results. Google offers Google Now which is much faster and delivers better results. Each carrier comes with their own suite of apps. Most of them are useless and take up a lot of space on the hard drive. The Verizon model is specially the worst. Fortunately, you can disable most of them and install your preferred choice of apps.CAMERAThe S5 comes with at 16 megapixel camera on the back and a 2.1 megapixel on the front. I do not use the front camera very often but the back camera I use every day. For taking pictures it is simply fantastic. I really like it. The camera focuses really fast and come out looking very sharp. You will get the occasional blurry picture but they are few and far in between. Night shots take a little more time to focus and there is a higher chance of getting blurry pictures. The HTC One(M8) takes better night pictures than the S5 but the S5 camera takes much better daylight pictures. I have tried both phones and for general usage the camera on the S5 is considerably better.One of the things I really like about the camera is the HDR mode. You know how sometimes when you take a picture and the subjects are standing in front of a lot of sunlight and the faces tend to come out darker than you want them to. Well when you activate HDR mode the camera takes several pictures at the same time with different exposures. It then combines them all together and highlights the best part of each photo. It makes a big difference. Now, many phones have HDR mode but in most of them you have to take the picture and then once it is done you have to go back on the gallery and check how the picture came out and see if you like it. On the S5 however, when you activate HDR mode it automatically shows you a preview on the screen of how the picture will come out. It is the first phone I have seen do it and I really like it.The Galaxy S5 has the ability to take videos in 4K resolution. The videos come out looking sharp. Unfortunately, the S5 does not have optical image stabilization. That means that videos come out looking very shaky. You really have to slow and have a steady hand if you want the video to not shake as much. This is one area where the LG G2 is considerably better than the S5 thanks to the image stabilization. The G2 videos still shake if you are not careful but not nearly as much. The image stabilization didn’t make nearly as big a difference when it came to pictures though. They are both good camera phones.BATTERY LIFEThe Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a removable 2800 mah battery. The usage is going to vary between people but for my regular day I found the batter life to be more than adequate. The thing I noticed that drained the battery quicker was the web browser. It lasts a surprisingly good time when it comes to videos though. You will appreciate this if you like streaming Netflix and YouTube. On a regular day I make about half an hour worth of calls, send about 50 texts along with an hour or so of web browsing. I usually go to sleep with the battery at about 40%. Not bad at all. I charge it every day for good measure. The phone takes between 90 to 120 minutes to charge depending on whether you are using it or not at the time.A new addition to the S5 is “Ultra Power Saving Mode”. What it basically does it strips your smartphone of everything that makes it “smart”. It is meant to be used when your battery is about to run out and it will basically only let you send texts, makes calls and use a total of six apps. The screen will also turn white and black to conserve more power. It is meant as a desperate last resort strategy. Hopefully you won’t have to use it often.STORAGEThe standard version of the Galaxy S5 comes with 16 GB of internal storage. However, there is only about 10 GB of those available for you to use out of the box. The rest is taken up by the operating system and the apps that come pre-installed. Fortunately, the S5 supports the use of MicroSD cards up to 128 GB. That is great feature because you can use an MicroSD card to store your pictures and videos and use the internal storage to install apps from the Play Store.CONCLUSIONDo I recommend this premium smartphone? In all honesty I do. It has a fantastic screen, smooth performance, and a very nice camera. The exterior design of the phone has been improved considerably from the S4. You will probably appreciate the addition of the fingerprint sensor and water resistant features. The heart rate monitor is not perfect but it works under the right conditions.I would have liked to have 32 GB of internal storage as opposed to 16 GB on the base model. Optical Image Stabilization would be a nice addition in the future.Overall the phone is feature packed and very complete. Samsung has proven to build pretty solid and reliable phones and they usually support software updates for at least a couple of years. I really thing that this phone is a great choice that you will like. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars.",2014年6月30日 在美国审核
"Wow, samsung got this one right!","Wow, coming from my first smartphone which was an iPhone I would have to say I am overall very pleased! I love that I am no longer locked in to one thing but can now completely customize my phone how I like! Screen is gorgeous! Love how light this phone is! I could hold it for hours and my hand wouldn't tire!!! Another feature I have loved is the interchangeable batteries!!! I don't think I could ever do without this again, one battery dies just pop in another and your good to go! Buy this phone, you won't regret it!

For Functionality Not Popularity,"I've never had such a hard time choosing a new phone as I did this time because there's just so many good ones. After reading and watching all the reviews, it came down to priorities.With anything,you have to know what you want out of it and how you're going to use it.For me,there were a few things I knew I wanted my next phone to have.1. Removable battery2. Good battery life3. Great camera4. Fast processor for web browsing5. Android OS (used to it)Though I looked into all of the top phones to see what they all offered,most of them were eliminated by falling short in one or more areas of my list.They are nice phones but were not what I was looking for. I was pretty quickly able to cross off the HTC One M8, Droid Maxx, Nokia Lumina and iPhone (have one as a work phone)for one or more reasons.That left the Galaxy S5 and LG G3.These are the premier heavyweights on the android market right now.I was back and forth on these 2 repeatedly until the S5 edged it out with a brighter display, narrower frame (I have small hands) and durability by way of water and dust resistance. I never once thought about what was popular or stylish. I'm also not a brand loyalist (owned Nokia, Palm, HTC and Motorola), and looked at every hand set individually. For me, a phone is a tool and it's all about functionality. I also don't need to have the latest and greatest every year either, which is why I want a removable battery, so I can replace it when I goes bad.I've had my S5 for a week now and even though it's my first ""flagship"" device,it's familiar yet new in all the right ways. I'm comfortable with it yet having a good time learning new things that my older phones couldn't do. I'm happy with my choice and don't need to second guess it because I did my homework.On a side note, I found some of the review sites difficult and frustrating to read and listen to. Problem being, they've all used and or owned everything out there for years now and they're not impressed by anything unless it's totally new and original. They're also obsessed with outer appearance and want everything to have a metal casing. In short,they're spoiled. A lot of them weren't as impressed with the S5 because they've had every Samsung Galaxy up to this point and wanted it to look and feel completely new. Well, I haven't, so it's new to me. As for the outer appearance, most of us are going to buy a case for our new phones so it's going to end up looking like that anyway. I was just a little put off by their, ""we want something new"" attitudes.Update: It's been 2 weeks now and I'm very impressed with the GS5. The battery life is outstanding! I can easily go 2 days off of one charge and that's something I've never been able to say before. The screen is fantastic for reading, the brightness and colors are off the charts. Everything pops on screen. Videos play smoothly and look good and the camera has tons of options and takes better pictures than any stand alone camera I've ever had. It's also very light weight and I can barely feel it in my pocket. There's still alot for me to learn though because this phone just has so many options. If you're interested, just get it, you won't be disappointed.",2014年9月21日 在美国审核
Archie Bunker using an Android?!,"My older husband is the Archie Bunker type,stuck in his ways after 6 decades, not readily looking to change.He is also REALLY attached to the physical Qwerty keyboard of his old Env3 type flip phone (Env3 in 2014? See what I mean?) especially for text messaging (usually to YELL AT ME IN ALL CAPS!) So imagine my surprise the morning the Galaxy S5 launched,to be awakened FOUR Hours before Verizon even opens to be told WE ARE GETTING S5s. Seriously?WE?! It's MY account.We? I've been holding out 2.5 years for Motorola to get off its behind for the Droid 5, WE are getting S5s?Did I mention that my Archie Bunker has a partially paralyzed hand AND peripheral neuropathy? He has very limited sensation in his hands....I'm smelling disaster.Four whole hours. Til Verizon opens. We get breakfast.We stalk Verizon.After the kind store manager gave us an S5 to play with for awhile,I reluctantly ordered a black and white matched pair.Grreat. Now I had all weekend to await the arrival of my dreamship while fear began to engulf me.What have I done?! What am I thinking?!We are talking about my Archie Bunker here (no!I am most certainly NOT Edith!)The phones arrived.We're activated. I set up his Google account and calendar (forgetting all about his stored contacts on his ancient phone...), and began hunting down the most crucial apps and laying out his desktop in an orderly fashion - Gmail, clean sweep, advanced task killer, the weather channel, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Hulu+, TED, Kindle, etc. Widgets,can't forget those!I also installed a screen protector and leather case.(hint: have your technomage spouse or technogeek grandkids do this for Archie types!) It was time to turn him loose. I cringed in fear.A month has now lapsed.I'm ready to write this review.Wow. Despite the hand issues, he has figured out ways to make the touch screen respond appropriately. He's become a regular on Facebook, even at 3am from bed! His adult kids are angered because he stopped communicating as much (note: we eventually realized the S5 shows ACCOUNT names on incoming calls,when he sees his 'ex-wife' calling he obviously isn't answering lol!) and without that physical keyboard he's all but forgotten texting exists...Even to reply to me. ::sigh::But what has he learned to do?!His LinkedIn is now over 1200 connections,he's all over Facebook day and night even from the car (passenger of course) and waiting rooms, hitting Like hours before even I see the post! He's found the camera,our poor German Shepherd Dog now cringes at the sound of the 'shutter' click knowing that bright flash is blinding! Poor Aiko! At least Daddy hasn't yet been posting his candid furball mugs all over Facebook (that's my job!)He's so attached to his S5 it goes with him everywhere! Even to his metal desk in the basement,which remains our cell phone black hole...So if you experienced dead zones with other phones that likely won't change.If my knight in shining armor can survive his first month on an S5, so can yours.I highly recommend the S5,even for those with moderate hand disabilities.",2014年5月13日 在美国审核
I like the phone,"I like the phone, it's fast and takes great pictures plus there is so much you can do MOST of the gimmicks are legit. I had a tough time deciding which one to get between this one and the LG G3. I got this one because of the water, dust resistance, and the 16 mega pixel camera. But with only 16gb of storage you would think that's fairly enough coming from an iPhone 4 with only 8gb, until you see all the bloatware the phone comes with... its ridiculous. yes you can get an sd card but.. I seriously have 6gb left in my internal storage bcuz of miscellaneous files and who knows what else. neither Samsung nor Verizon was able to help me out with this problem. I hope they fix it soon, bcuz it does drain your battery. I was able to find some ways to increase my battery life, but the phone shouldn't have came with all those preloaded apps. Maybe there is a way around this because if not Samsung you have disappointed me. I did try to uninstall and disable them but they kept updating and coming back, for the most part right now some are turned off. It says I have 2.17gb of apps, I DO NOT!!! it's disappointing... because it is a great phone.I hope some of you find this useful. :)",2014年9月25日 在美国审核
I like the size and performance of this phone,"I love droids.I guess that's fair to say, but I've never owned an iPhone so I can't make any comparison there.Ever since I've been a member of the smart phone club I've had Samsung Galaxy phones...first an S2 and now an S5.I've have this phone for several months now, maybe even more than a year.I am not the kind of guy who rushes out and has to have the newest and latest thing.Instead, I prefer to sit back for a while and when it's time to upgrade my phone I look at phones that have an established service and performance track record.The Galaxy S5 has both of those.Plus, by upgrading to something other than the latest generation phone the phone is often much cheaper, but hey, it's still free.I like the size and performance of this phone.The screen is large enough to make personal viewing easy and the phone is small enough to fit comfortably in a shirt pocket.The operation is largely intuitive, especially if you have used a smart phone before.It's easy to check and change settings as needed.I don't use my phone heavily, checking it or using it perhaps 1-2 dozen times per day.At this rate the battery still often has 50% plus charge at the end of the work day, and on lighter days as much as 70% left!That's impressive.I use an otter box commuter cover for it and that's perfect for me.The phone is fast enough for anything I've tried to do with it...though of course most of that is probably network related.Even so, whether playing a game or streaming video or even (gasp) using the phone as a phone, it's been a champ.Barring major damage I will probably continue to use this phone for another year or so at least.I highly recommend this phone.It's got great features and performance.Even the camera is impressive.",2016年1月26日 在美国审核
S5 Review,"Let me start off by saying that complaints about poor signal strength, texting not working and similar complaints are NOT this phones fault they are the carrier and thus not valid to an equipment review.1. Durability - I relied on the professionals to test the durability (cnet, etc.). However I do know that the phone is at least as durable as the S3 which I dropped on the concrete several times at 3' to 5' and the gorilla glass never broke and the phone worked normal, also used it in the rain with no problems. The phone is one of the most durable excluding construction phones available.2. Signal strength - the same as most phones, only older non smart phones that have extended antennas and phones that allowed you to connect to signal boosters and external antennas will get you a better signal.3. Voice Quality - Tried speakerphone, Bluetooth, headset and regular mic. everyone I spoke to told me the voice clarity was very good. On my end I found the volume a little on the low side and had to use the increased volume option in a noisy environment.4. Camera - The quality of the picture in still - auto mode, panorama and movie mode is excellent. The delay people experience is the camera compensating for the environment so you get a good quality picture. The picture quality in my opinion rivals a good non-professional digital camera.5. Screen - Screen size is one of the largest available on a cell phone. Screen clarity is amazing and you can even see images and use the key pad in direct sunlight a great improvement from older phones.6. Surfing the internet - I tested the phone on WIFI and received up to 57mbs. (The fastest speed my provider had), the phone processor is as fast as a good computer. People that complain about the connection speed in my opinion are having a carrier problem not a problem with this phone.7. Heart beat monitor - Yes it works, but it is very sensitive and you may have to re-take the measurement several times.8. Music - no problems with clarity.8. Battery Life - Over 24 hours with ""normal"" usage. Normal being texting, music, voice, camera in still mode, use.9. Overall Impression: Very well constructed, options work as advertised. I believe you will have a hard time finding a better quality phone. In my opinion the only real negative was the volume during calls; it was ""ok"" but in my opinion should be a little louder in normal mode.",2014年5月22日 在美国审核
The Galaxy S5 is worth every penny,"This phone was definitely my best, even though it lasted for the least amount of time compared to my other phones. I'm always careful with my technology because I need to it last, so usually my phones get years of life in before they're replaced. It was not in the cards with this phone. I had it for about 6 months when my foster dog decided it was the new chew toy. She mangled the bottom right corner so I was sure the back button was toast, but not so. Somehow it still worked perfectly fine, no problems! Awesome. Now it's been a few months, and I was just out hiking when the phone slipped out of my jacket pocket and fell into a river. It was in there for at least 10 minutes before I realized and went to find it. The phone is built to be water resistant, but since mine was already damaged I was pretty much resigned to total failure. Nope! This little trouper still functioned, and continued to do so until I could get home and make sure all of my files were backed up and saved. The phone did suffer water damage, and has since stopped working, but after all that abuse I'm really impressed it lasted as well as it did. I'll be sticking with Samsung when I can get a new phone!",2016年3月29日 在美国审核
Just Got One - Here's the Deal,"I don't have a lot to say after only one day but it was an easy transition from my Motorola Razr with a 3-year old battery. I'm getting all my apps squared away and customizing for my personal taste is smooth enough. It doesn't take long to recognize that the phone has some really nice features - I'm not yet able to report on battery life but that's why I upgraded. I had the original Droid Razr that I had to pre-order because it wasn't yet known just how pathetic that battery performance actually was. Thanks, Motorola.I am curious as to why the phone costs $250 with a 2-year contract in the Verizon Store and $100 on Amazon. There is a $50 mail-in rebate but it's still twice as much. And there's the $30 activation fee and the old 'by-the-way', that unlimited data plan you were grandfathered into no longer applies. I now get 2 GB and additional fees apply if that is exceeded. But, they assured me that after the initial bill with the activation fee, my Family Plan bill would remain the same. I'll update that if that turns out to be false.I did buy their $20 roll-on screen protector but their process is nothing special. I could have just used the run-of-the-mill protector.I tried the 16 MP camera in daylight and it was very crisp. Big chunk of data if you upload using other than WiFi but the one thing that is consistent about Verizon is you're lucky to get an edge signal here. Downloads that size would crash and burn using cell service. Yea, it bright red 4G LTE on the map but not on the phone. Unfortunately, nobody has ever commented on how good their carrier's signal is here. Scary since there are a lot of boaters on the bay who think the phone is a good alternative to VHF radio. On the other hand, a surprise came when I noticed how far I was from the house and still connected to my home network. Simply amazing.The one glitch I see is that the weather reported by the phone is incorrect. The location and time are correct but that's a glitch I have yet to figure out. It'll consistently refresh with the wrong information. Maybe it's just telling me what I want to hear.I've set the fingerprint reader to unlock the phone and it works but sometimes takes a few tries. There is the option of using patterns and passwords instead. No bells and whistles omitted on this phone. I could live without the cover that protects the USB and HDMI connectors and expect that will be the one thing that breaks. Just a hunch.There is a slot for an additional SD card and the one from my old Droid now lives there. Plenty of memory. Also, the battery is replaceable and that's a big deal to me. Needs no special tools like the aftermarket kits to open the Motorola and Apple devices. Speaking of which, someone was returning the new Apple phone while I was buying the Samsung. Don't know why but not a good sign. A lot of words for a phone I've had for just a day but it's a lot of phone.",2014年10月4日 在美国审核
Samsung Made a Winner,"I upgraded to this phone on the Verizon Edge plan.The Samsung Galaxy S5 has met all of my expectations.The biggest issue for me with cell phones is battery life and charge time. Does the battery last a reasonably long time and how fast does it charge up? The Galaxy S5 battery has a long life. I haven't needed to charge it daily and it does charge fast. I have yet to have the battery level drop below 50% in a day's moderate use and it charged fully in less than an hour. Another positive for this phone is that the battery can be replaced. If you get a weak battery you can buy a cheap replacement and change it yourself. I find the power saver settings to be beneficial to battery life on this phone.Included in the box were the user's manual and a really nice home charger. This has a double port charger which is something I haven't seen before. The charger was impressive, looks and feels like a durable, high qulaity charger.The Galaxy S5 is one of the easier to navigate phones that I have owned. The manual is helpful, but the layout of this phone makes it easier to get adjusted to without consulting the manual.Browsing the web is another stongpoint on this model. The speed and ease of use is top-notch! Browsing is so easy!Another feature that I really appreciate is the controls below the bottom of the screen. The right side is a back button, the left side brings up a task manager where I can close apps(Chrome browser, email etc..). I have had phones in the past where I had to hunt for the close apps function. Not so with the Galaxy S5.The weather app has been a convenience.For call clarity and signal strength, this phone has been excellent!Update* I have had this phone 20 months. First on Verizon then Page Plus. I replaced the original battery when it no longer charged. That was a month ago. Saturday last week and today the screen became unresponsive and the operating system was inoperable for a few minutes. It did come back. The replacement battery was an OEM Samsung battery and it holds a charge very well. The issue isn't battery or update related.The point for me is that this phone has been dependable for almost two years.",2014年10月25日 在美国审核
Just okay.,"Just okay. Let's just say, I wish I got an Iphone!I'll start with the good...1. The screen is awesome - a bright and beautiful display.2. Expandable storage - and micro SD cards are really cheap these days3. In general, more options and freedom as far as apps, controls, music, etc than the Iphone.Then the bad...1. The Touch wiz interface is very laggy.Scrolling from screen to screen is super slow.2. Camera is slow.It takes way too long to load and by the time it loads, I have missed the moment I wanted to take a picture of.3. Touch screen almost too sensitive. I find often that before the screen goes back to sleep that I have either called someone or moved some icons around.4. The auto correct is awful when compared to the iphone in texts and emails. (I understand this could probably be fixed with an app, but don't have time to screw around with it).5. The phone is almost a little too big for my preference. It's hard to use one handed (and there is a built in feature to make that better, but I don't ever find it useful).6. The fingerprint reader is useless to me.You have to do a swiping motion. I find that after washing dishes one night my fingerprint no longer works. I have given up on the fingerprint reader all together.7. The battery life is just average.If I don't use the phone all day, am connected to wifi at work, I will come home with about 60% battery at the end of the day.My husband with the iphone 6 will be at 95%.8. Google Now is perverse!! lolI asked it to lookup an address,and it heard something very, very dirty.9. I really wanted to like the remote control, but the app that comes with the phone, Smart Remote (Peel), gives me all these notifications about sports and shows that I really do not care about.It also lost my settings after an update, so I need to reprogram everything again.I do not want the remote to have the TV Guide features, and bombard me with stuff that doesn't interest me... I just want to control the TV!My Iphone 4s was super slow with the last IOS update, and was constantly out of storage space, so the Galaxy 5s seemed like the smart choice, but I regret my decision.I have owned the phone for 6 months now and I am counting down the days til my next upgrade!!",2014年12月16日 在美国审核
"Great build quality, Superb Display, Speedy Interface and Up to Date hardware. Fingerprint scanner is fun to use.","What's great about it: The amount of value they pack into this phone is truly incredibleWhat's not so great: Call quality is no worse than other phones, but still needs work; sound output is too low and has one very irksome traitEverything you could want in a cell phone and more is here. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is awe-inspiring. So let's get into it.First, the screen. While I am getting a little annoyed by how large cell phones are getting, I see the need for it. The picture quality is superb! But seen on a smaller screen, the quality would not shine through. I've always hated viewing videos on my cell phone, but the S5 does a great job of making me miss my laptop less. And games are more enjoyable too! Photos are so clear it's mindboggling. No cons here.Discussing the processor and other ""brain"" components is boring, so suffice it to say that the S5 is very fast and multitasks very well, without being a drain on the battery. Which brings me to...The battery! I've never seen such an impressive battery life. I don't know if they're using a special sort of battery or they've just figured out a way to use power more efficiently (which, without getting into it, they have figured out a way), but I don't care. All I care about is that my phone lasts all day and I'm a fairly heavy user. I must admit though, I'm not a heavy caller and making calls does use a lot of juice. I do use a lot of data however (both WiFi and 4G), and thus far have never run out of power.The camera is phenomenal, albeit cumbersome. There are just too many options for the casual user. If you're a professional photographer or even just a hobbyist, you've got a dedicated device. So if you're taking photos on your phone, you're probably just a regular person trying to capture a moment. In which case, you don't need 7,000 options that you don't know how to use. It's overkill and it's confusing. But, it does take great photos!I won't discuss data. We all have different carriers, so we'll all have different experiences. I use AT&amp;T and for the most part have had no problems, except in underdeveloped parts of town. I will say, however, that the phone switches automatically between your 4G and your WiFi to help use less of your data plan. While that's very cost-efficient, I sometimes find that I'll be in the middle of something and my phone will get hung up waiting on the switch. That being said, there is an option to turn off the automatic switching. So, your choice.Most of you will already know that Samsung uses the Android operating system. Google is to credit or blame for most of what's going on there, and I, for one, like what they're doing, especially when compared to Apple, Microsoft, or even Blackberry. However, each phone maker tweaks Android to fit their vision. Before the S5, I had the HTC One. Let me just say that I am far happier with the S5 in almost every way. (I used to be a big Blackberry fan, but sadly, they're not keeping up.)Another point I won't get too much into is features. As I mentioned earlier, this phone is so feature rich, it's truly incredible. It does everything you're gonna want and it does it well, and it usually far exceeds expectations and the competition.I do have two things I'm not so in love with though. The first is the call quality. As I said, it's no worse than any other phone, but it still needs attention. For instance, with all the technological advances they've made, why do we still have half-duplex instead of full-duplex? (More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakerphone) The phone call experience is the one time when I feel like I'm back in the 1980s.My second problem with this phone is the sound output. First, it's just not loud enough. I'm not talking about the little speaker on the back. I'm not expecting much from that. I'm referring to the ""line out"" and bluetooth. I like to use Audible to listen to books while I'm travelling to and from work or when I'm at the gym. When I play Pandora or the songs I have stored, the volume is acceptable at best. But with the audiobooks, it simply cannot be heard.Second, it has a safety feature that you cannot disable. It's supposed to help you protect yourself from going deaf. Thanks. Much obliged. But, I'm not a 4-year-old. If you insist on being a bit of a nanny, at least let me disable your mothering once you've tried to warn me.I would never let those two minor issues dissuade you from buying this phone. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is still, by far, the best phone I've ever owned. I cannot imagine what they could ever do to top it, but I'm sure I'll buy the next iteration when they do achieve a new level of supremacy.This product is...

Samsung Galaxy S5 is an Excellent Phone,"I was a satisfied user of the iPhone 5 and 4S. Both served me well and were great performers for the technology of their time. Those phones are not in the same class as the Galaxy S5.If Apple had released the larger iPhone 6 sooner, I probably would have purchased it but I am so glad I made the decision to purchase the Galaxy S5 now. Samsung has aced it with this phone.If you are switching from an iPhone, turn off iMessage on your iPhone before you activate the Galaxy S5. Otherwise, Apple will block your text messages. Also get the Samsung Smart Switch Mobile app from the Android Play Store. I used the cloud transfer from my iPhone and the process was fast and efficient.I purchased the phone at Best Buy because I wanted to hold the phone and make sure the 5.1"" larger size screen would work for me. I have small hands and it has helped to have the phone in an Otterbox case so I have plenty of grip on the phone. If this is your first smartphone, you will have to have some patience learning the phone, just as you would have to do with any other smartphone. If you are a veteran, you will love the HD screen and lightning fast response. This S5 is outstanding in every category. The battery life is pretty decent, too.",2014年6月26日 在美国审核
Really starts to shine with a few accessories,"It's a powerful phone with good battery life.But it's better with a few accessories.At first, I wondered about the design choice of having a ridge protruding at the edges of the phone above the touchscreen surface.The home button also sticks up a little.But after I put a tempered-glass screen protector on it, it made a lot more sense.Everything becomes flush.I think it was designed to be used with a screen protector.They probably realized most people were going to put one on anyway.This phone has a removable battery - and a removable back to go along with that.You can replace the original cover with a special Qi charging cover Samsung makes for it to enable wireless charging.That eliminates the need to mess with the USB port cover.Add in a couple wireless charging mats - the larger white ones Samsung made for the S4 are generally reviewed as the better ones - and anytime you want to top off your phone you can just set it on a mat.Note that if you want to use a case with the wireless charging cover, it has to be a special case designed for that - the wireless charging cover is slightly thicker than the default cover.Speaking of cases, I actually like the hand-feel of this phone better with a case.Tudia makes a nice TPU case that's compatible with the wireless charging cover, and you don't have to take the case off to charge.A case makes the phone thicker, but that thickness actually makes a phone of this size easier to hold for one-handed use - and helps to keep the bottom of your thumb from activating the back button inadvertently.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核
Verizon had some pretty good deals on other cellphone devices,"My previous cellphone (Motorola X) was eligible for upgrade.I had an S3 for a work phone, so I knew I wanted a Samsung product.Verizon had some pretty good deals on other cellphone devices, however they wanted $199.99 for upgrade to the S5.I went to our local corporate office, and they couldn't do much better.Thankfully, I checked with Amazon and saw they had the S5 for a whopping $79 dollars.Couldn't believe it!Ordered the phone on a Friday, delivered the next Tuesday!Amazon emailed me the instructions for activation with Verizon, which worked flawlessly.This phone is phenomenal.OS seems faster, camera and images are amazing.Call quality seems very clear.My wife upgraded to same (except in white), and she loves it too.The construction seems lighter, but tight.Just overall pleased with the cellphone, Verizon and Amazons great deals.Highly recommended.",2014年11月7日 在美国审核
wonderful phone,I have always liked the galaxy line of phone. My lady was the S3..now an S5. I frankly looked the heft of the S3 better. I know some think lighter is better but I do not think that is true. For this reason I bought a Zenus case that matches my galaxy note 2014 edition case. For me I have found that in cases you get what you pay for and Zenus is my favorite. Unfortunately they are only made for certain models. The phone handles beautifully except for setting up Microsoft exchange. It told me that I had 10 device limit already. However I am not sure if that may be a server issue holding on to devices not used any longer and I never had 10. All in all I agree with those that say do not pay attention to plastic body. I always use a case. To me it is how the phone functions and this one is great. I really am an android fan and the new galaxy is just what I am liking for. My one and only complaint is the door where the power charger hooks up. It feels flimsy and I always feel as if it is going to break off. It is hard to open without a spare pin or something to get into the place where you open it. Other than that ..no complaints.,2014年5月3日 在美国审核
Best phone I have ever owned!,"Fast, smooth, compatible with any and every app on the playstore market, and affordable with contract.No longer have to wait for Wifi to connect (almost instantly when key is entered), for a game to load (wicked quick with snapdragon), or for a call to be placed (enough memory to push aside running apps and make that darn call). Stock emoticons and messaging software is very nice, but can only be utilized with people who have a Galaxy. Compatibility with both apps and hardware is the highest with Samsung. If you are looking for a speaker attachment, custom case, or new game, the S5 will be the standard for it. Charges insanely fast with stock cord (has an extra piece that the usb minis do not, but will still charge with a mini) and keeps life all day + unless heavy gaming/texting. GPS has 3 modes to provide better accuracy. Booting and rebooting only takes about 30 seconds with this phone.I never like to run with the crowd and have the latest and greatest (usually like to give the underdog a chance), but in this case I took a chance and do not regret it at all.",2015年2月23日 在美国审核
The worst phone I've ever owned,"This phone has been nothing but trouble since a few months after I got it. It started freezing, auto-opening apps, closing apps that I was using (such as Google maps while I was using it to navigate), distorting my lock screen so that there were no numbers visible anymore, etc.I brought it in to have it looked at and they did a software update. Nothing changed.I brought it in again and they informed me that they could give me a replacement Galaxy S5. I was skeptical because I found out some friends were having similar troubles, but they would not give me a different phone as a replacement. I took the replacement Galaxy S5.The replacement phone is just as bad. The problem wasn't my device. It's the Galaxy S5. They still would not replace it. I am not sure whether to drop Samsung for this, or to drop Verizon for their awful customer service practices.

"5 stars with Android Kitkat 4.4 OS, 2 stars with Lollipop 5 OS, Samsung FORCES you to update","BIG PROBLEM: You are forced (yes, absolutely forced, as in, not given ANY choice) to update your phone to Lollipop. More on that below.Nothing is perfect, but I was compelled to write this review because of the inane Samsung / Verizon / Google policies and marketing.I may update the review later, but you can find a LOT more on this issue on the internet.1) The phone was nearly PERFECT balance of power, size and capability with Android Kitkat, 4.42) The phone really SUCKS in many ways with Android 5.0 Lollipop ( lollipops are terrible, cheap candies that are really really bad for you, while kitkats are nice chocolates, is that a coincidence?). Battery life, looks, you name it, it is just not that good. I manage two of these phones. The one with Kitkat (the only way to keep Kitkat is to root your phone) functions perfectly, love it. The one that got the Lollipoop disaster is horrible.3) FORCING the update on customers; Now, that is what really gets me. Imagine, if was MICROSOFT FORCING you to ""upgrade"" Windows 7 to 8.. Well, in essence, that is what Samsung / Verizon / Google have done. They all point fingers at EACH OTHER, but mainly the blame lies with SAMSUNG, I think, and, secondly, Verizon, for not standing up to Samsung for their customers. Google gets slapped for making a crappy OS change in the first place.I had a Samsung rep PERSONALLY admit to me that there is NOTHING they can do, and one has to just accept the fact that they force the operating system update on you. Unbelievable!If I choose to update, I accept the risk, that is understood. But, OS update should ALWAYS be end user choice!When I asked them to pass my complaint to their marketing department, the rep told me they were prohibited (!) by company policy to talk to other departments!Enough said.In conclusion:To keep Kitkat you will have to root this phone. I never felt the need until now, but I was not going to be forced into the Lollidowngrade. I am so glad I did. I have no problems at all. I would NOT buy this phone with Lollipop. I would rather go to Apple, and I nearly did. Apple does NOT force you to upgrade the operating system, by the way.Policies like these make no sense. I have been Android fan since it came out, and had just about every version of Android device ever made, but the direction this is taking is likely to drive me, a loyal customer, away. The three-headed hydra may not care, but Apple just might get another customer next time I buy a phone.",2015年6月22日 在美国审核
From HTC to Samsung,"The time came to upgrade my last phone, the HTC ONE so per some of friend's reviews I decided to go with the Samsung over the new HTC ONE M8.What I love:I love the lightweightness (I made that up) of the Galaxy. It's easy to hold on to and is sleek in it's design. Some complain about the battery cover but I'm a fan! I really enjoy the removable battery, sims card and memory card. One major disappointment I had with the HTC ONE. Now, getting to the inside of the phone. At first I wasn't thrilled about the magazine, news feed on the home screen but if you don't like it, there is an option to turn it off. The personalization on this phone are great for my needs! Another great point is the motion controls! Let's say your phone is ringing and you want to shut it up without touching it. Well, Samsung made it so that you can turn on an option to turn your phone over to make the noise stop. My favorite feature on the phone is the camera! I LOVE THE SAMSUNG CAMERA!! Samsung really hit it on the nail with this one. One of the major reasons I chose this phone! From the selective focus option, HDR, different modes, and most of all the Samsung editing studio. Fire up your video and you'll have pre-loaded customizable themes you can use with music and lots of filters! I love it.Now what I don't like so much.I don't have many things that I don't like. The main issue I have is the LAGGING time when viewing pictures in the gallery. Samsung really lacks in this manner. One thing I didn't have to deal with my HTC ONE. If there is a picture of video that you need to access quickly, I'd advise using the the ""tag or keyword"" options so that the photo can just be searched. Otherwise , you will be frustrated by the slow populating pictures. The other annoying feature of the galaxy s5 is the sensitive finger swipe option. First off, you must swipe your finger ""exactly the same way"" to register the finger and then comes the ""fun"" part. Swiping the finger to unlock the phone is sometimes a chore! It either tells you that you have to swipe all the way down, all the way on the keypad, swipe faster, swipe slower, etc. If you have patience, it's a great feature.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Maybe next time I'll even try another samsung phone.One last tip: one of the first things you should do is to make sure your phone isn't set to factory reset if you accidentally forget you pin, password or pattern. If you don't disable this option, too many incorrect attempts will factory reset your phone and erase EVERYTHING!",2015年7月2日 在美国审核
"Good phone, but a bit too large","From a purely functional point of view, the phone is basically flawless. Although I'm more familiar with apple products, I found the Android/Phone functions easy enough to to get used to after a day or two of fiddling around. However, after a week of ownership, I find the phone to just be too big for my liking. And no, I don't have small hands. I'm 6-3 with proportionally-sized hands. One handed operation is a chore. The phone does include a mode to make one-handed ops easier by making the screen field smaller.........of course, this negates the purpose of the larger phone. In the end I should have gone with a slightly smaller phone. However the phone DOES work as advertised, has good battery life (even with updated lolipop os),water resistance, Sd card, beautiful display, and several other nice features.

I've never owned a phone I hated more - wish I could give a half star,"I bought my S5 through an online retailer, not Amazon, but want to warn people about it through a well known site.I have had it for 6 months and I hate it.It is a 16GB phone with an SD card expansion.I bought a 64GB SD card, and have been able to load photos and a few apps, I still have 56GB available on my SD card, but none of the bloatware apps can be moved to it, and most apps I want to download cannot be loaded to the SD card.Further none of the bloatware can be uninstalled, only disabled.I have 510MB available on my phone and I have 10 apps that did not come pre-installed, 6 of which are on my SD card.That isn't really the deal breaker, just an annoyance; I mean seriously, I don't have kids so why can't I uninstall the Baby Crying Detector that came pre-loaded with this phone?The camera is horrible, the pictures are dark and grainy, or come out blurry.And the phone has such lag that getting candid shots is impossible.I have yet to take a clear picture of my dog with this; again, I own a camera, so not a deal breaker by itself, but the little things compound. So, the lag; I listen to audible on my phone every day.I press the play button on the audible app as I am walking out the door with the dog to go for a walk, and the book doesn't start playing until we're out of our yard, about 1 minute after I pressed play.It is the same for all of the other functions, the touch screen is terribly non-responsive and EVERYTHING is slow on this phone.Finally, for the past week my screen keeps freezing. Repeatedly.I am very hopeful that if I need to call 9-1-1 I am somewhere with a landline or another person with a decent phone because I press the home button on mine and swipe up to unlock and nothing happens.For a while taking the battery out fixed it, but that doesn't even do it now.Instead I have to reboot the phone by pressing the power button and volume down button until the reboot screen comes up, then choosing an option using the volume button and selecting using the home button.I have to do this every time the screen times out.That is apparently my breaking point.If I could afford a different phone I'd take a hammer to this garbage just for the immense satisfaction I would get.I will never, ever buy a Samsung phone again, total piece of ....6/10/16 UPDATE.The screen froze permanently.It was 11:30 at night, down pouring rain, my car broke down on a back road on the way home from my Aunt's house and my screen was completely frozen.I did everything and could not get it to work.Thankfully I had called my husband and told him I was leaving, my route, and when to expect me, so he was able to come help me when it was clear something was wrong.The next day I took the phone into the Verizon store, the rep did everything I had already done and SURPRISE, it didn't work.So he called customer service, put me on the phone with them, and after 2 hours, and repeating everything both the rep and I had already done they told me my touchscreen was broken.Really? I had no idea! (Sorry for the sarcasm, but this is 2 weeks later and I'm still rather irritated).I was then told they would ship me a refurbished phone, because since the brand new one failed a refurbished one won't be total crud. I got to keep my existing battery and cover, but had to ship the old phone back in 5 days or pay $300.I sort of get that, but I only paid $25 for the original phone.Anyway, I have the new phone, and it has an update that I did not run on my old one because I didn't want the new features. I'm still unhappy.The touch screen works, but whenever I leave my house I have to turn off wifi then restart the phone to get mobile data to come on.I will never buy a Samsung phone again!",2016年4月24日 在美国审核

This is coming from a die-hard Apple fan,"I'll keep this short, since you probably have some dinner to cook:1. I have had an iPhone for 3 years2. I have had an iPad for same three years3.

Got Samsung S5 to replace the equally bad iPhone, because the S5 is more versatile and can download ANY music or other files.6. iPhone is tied to iTunes so is severely limited in types of files it can download.The bottom line is that Samsung S5 and Tab are much more flexible than any Apple products, and I recommend them over Apple any day.

S5 ROCKS!,"Man, I love this phone. I had previously been using an iPhone 5S Gold from Verizon. After many, many, many billing discrepancies I asked what could be done to rectify the problem. They told me that getting a new sim card would help, tried that and it didn't work. I was frustrated. I then saw somebody was selling a like new S5 for a good deal and I offered my iPhone as a trade. They took it and the rest was history. Now I have my new phone and am enjoying it.After my previous issues with the S4, I'm pleased to say Samsung actually has it right this time. They focused on what people critiqued them about, and made this phone IMMENSELY better than anything out there. I've had many cell phones in the past, and mostly have had DROIDS, but have always also had a soft-spot for iPhones, there are a couple of apps that I cannot get on the play store, I could with my iPhone on the App Store. These weren't essential, but were fun word games like Bookworm. I also don't like what apps you can get like Angry Birds, on the S5 they have advertisements thru the whole game. I'm told it's just with Android, and same with the permissions, I understand that different games need to know if a call is in progress in order to start working, but it doesn't need to analyze your call log. It seems as though apps are a bit more intrusive. I don't game all that much, and when I do, it's from my console, so this ""con"" if you can even call it that doesn't even bother me. I'm just confused because it kinda gives people the edge that their information might not be safe. S4 did this when I installed a different keyboard. But I can't complain.The S-Health app is far more accurate than the health app offered by Apple. The reason being is that this one on the Android lets you input things such as the foods you eat, etc, and is set up to tell you that you burned off a certain amount of those calories. This phone can also take your heart beat per minute and gauge your health and exercise off of that plan. It helps many people stay fit.The camera is by far the best I've had on any phone out there. No cons when it comes to the camera, but it could be better at times at focusing on a moving object. I've heard that the Note 4 is good for still shot focusing, but if it takes pictures with a tiny bit of delay like mine, it's not going to turn out well.Sound quality is awesome. Music and speakerphone are great.Smart Remote is freaking amazing. I've never had a phone that could double as my phone remote, my stereo remote, tell me different channels as a TV guide and also work remotely with my DVR to record shows. iOS has some catching up to do on that part, the only way I can see it working with them is if there is an ""APP FOR THAT""BTW, if you are looking for a good case and not wanting to spend big bucks, check out the Spigen Neo Hybrid. I have had this case on my phone since the first day I rec'd it and I cannot be happier with this case.4G LTE/XLTE data, but you know how fast that is already.Surprisingly good support with my MBP.I've had many phones, but I really like this one.

Beautiful. Would reconmend,"Smart phones have come a long way, especially in the past two years. I upgraded from my Razr Max and am very happy so far. I've had it for over a week.One of the first things I did (and you should too) is disabled the bloatware. There's a lot of it. I also got rid of the ugly default everything.It feels fast. I like the dust flap, for now. The camera is great. Don't be a fool (like I was at first) and make sure you scroll though all the option in the camera mode! The camera took me a few days to learn. The display is sharp. Power save and extra touch sensitivity could be useful.What I don't like: The heart rate monitor. Like many other reviews, it's kinda pointless and probably adds $100 to the phone. I don't like how clunky it is to access the camera from the unlock screen. The speakers are kinda dull, why can't they be on the front? If you are a Mac user like me, you need to install ""Android Safe Transfer"" which is total BS. You can't preview your files like you can in the Mac UI. Also, I wish all of the hard press buttons were on the right side.I really enjoy it so far, but these little inconveniencesmake it a total of 4/5 stars.",2014年6月24日 在美国审核
Nice toy.,"The Galaxy 5 really is a good piece of equipment and yes it is very fast but what a power sponge it is. There are power saving options including the ""Ultra"" option but that defeats the purpose of the phone. It limits usable apps and leaves the display screens with a dull background. If I wanted that I wouldn't have bought this phone.The thing is the galaxy 5 really is not a phone, it is a very small tablet. It works like a tablet, looks like a tablet and Verizon bills you as it would a tablet. Be very careful with the plan you choose. Once you go over the Gig limit it costs $15.00 for each additional gig used. I booked for 2g at $90.00 per month but quickly called customer service and upped it to 5g at the same price. The people in the stores are not these to help....trust me on this. Moral of this story...stay on WIFI when possible.The last thing is an industry wide problem. Build better batteries. With the way people depend on these things and at a retail price of $600.00 Samsung and the rest should come up with a higher capacity battery. Not everyone has time to charge their phones every few hours. My advice....buy a portable battery pack so you can charge all of your tech toys at any time. Ladies the batteries I am referring to are small, are high capacity and fit in your bag so you can charge while on the go. Guys...we have to make do with pockets.Okay, to wrap this up....Be very careful with your price plan and buy an external battery because there is very little chance this unit makes it through the day.",2014年4月30日 在美国审核
Step down from the s4,"It's a decent phone for Android, but trying to go a step up from the s4,it's incredibly disappointing. The s4 is much better than the s5. It's like the intuitive guys who made the s4 got fired, and some retards from Apple made this phone. All the nice little features from the s4 got ruined on the s5. You can no longer have any widgets or shortcuts on the lock screen, the only thing you can have is a camera shortcut. You can't clear your ram, you can only close all the open apps,and it still doesn't really clear the ram, whereas the s4 cleared the ram but kept the apps you were using open. The timeout on the lock screen is too short to do anything but briefly look at the time. Don't try to look at any of your notifications because the screen will lock before you even get a chance to look at them. It's just a bunch of really annoying stuff like that. It's unintuitive,which doesn't make any sense seeing as the s4 was intuitive and they somehow went backwards. I mean if you're going from an iPhone to Android,it's still pretty good,but after having an s4, I regret buying this, and just want my s4 back.",2015年6月22日 在美国审核
Highly Recommended - Kimberly Davidson,"I am very satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy S5. Unlike many other smartphones, it is water-resistant and contains its own Integrated Mobile Health Partner (S Health). S Health has proven to contain very accurate nutrition information on a vast amount of foods. It also possesses a heart rate detector and a pedometer, both of which can be very useful to any health-conscious individual. The phone has a very large and beautiful display but still weighs a mere 5.12 ounces. The camera on this smartphone is impeccable. I also like that you can transfer your entire iTunes library to the phone using Google Play. There is no need to download a new media player and purchase everything again. Other reviews state that the plastic on the back of the phone is a drawback but I disagree. Glass phones break very easily but I have dropped this phone multiple times without any surface damage being done. It is a considerably sturdy phone. Lastly, the S5's battery life is nothing to overlook. The advertisements state that the battery will last through 29 hours of talk time. I have personally experienced an instance showing how great the phone keeps its charge when I took it on a four hour car trip and streamed music online the entire time without losing more than 20% of the battery. After the battery dies completely, it only takes an hour and a half to charge back to 100%.Even though I highly recommend this phone to everyone, there is one very minor drawback. When setting up the phone you must create a Gmail account. This isn't an operational flaw but more of an inconvenience to the user. You now have to memorize another email address and password.Overall, this phone is worth the price tag. I plan on keeping it for a very long while.",2014年9月9日 在美国审核

I'M NOT DRIVING!,"The S5 wants you to be safe. It has this horriblefeature called car mode. When in this mode it will reject calls and texts so you will not be distracted while driving. Car Mode activates any time this phone is paired with any Bluetooth divice.I have a smart watch, therefore, I am always in car mode.You can select ""I'm not driving""from the menu.This works for about 10 minutes.The app cannot be disabled. If you do a forced stop, it will just start up again. You cannot uninstall it.I've called Samsung and taken it to the Verizon store. I've often screamed OMG I'M NOT (explative) DRIVING!!Nothing works. At least I can turn off the auto reply. It kept sending messages to my boss that I was driving when I should have been in the office. Now it just announces to my coworkers that I'm receiving a personal call and the name of the caller.I wonder how many lives have been saved by blocking calls for a person sitting in their cubicle. My chair has wheels but I'm not going to crash into a filing cabinet and die. When I'm driving, the hands free functions in my car compete with car mode so that neither works. I am not able to use any voice activated functions when I am driving because of car mode. I'm going back to a Motorola phone first chance I get.Moto Assist operates smoothly with my car.It uses GPS to detect when I'm driving and allows me to easily operate everything hand free.

The first phone I've ever owned to simultaneously impress and disappoint (review after 10 months of use),"It's hard to call this phone trash when it's capable of doing so many more things than the average smartphone. The problem is, half of these things sadly either don't work well, or don't even work at all. One of the more noticeable flaws of the phone, is the fingerprint scanner. Why is this flawed? Because half of the time, it doesn't even work. How is this even remotely convenient when it takes me a full 5 minutes just to unlock my screen? And the directions on how it works don't help very much either.Another major gripe that I have with this phone is the pathetic touchscreen. I've never had a phone lag so badly to the point where after turning it on I couldn't even unlock it. And it does this on a regular daily bases too. This didn't become a problem for me until about 2-3 months after I got the phone. This must be why all the reviews on youtube talk so highly of it, because they review the phone after the first day or week that they've had it while the phone is still at least somewhat fully functional.The camera is probably one of the most embarrassing things about this phone. While it may not be bad hardware-wise, software-wise it's atrocious. The fact that a camera from the 1980's can take better pictures than this thing is pretty laughable. The auto-focus (if you can even call it that) rarely even focuses on the thing your trying to take a picture of, so every time you take a picture of something, it looks like your wearing the wrong prescription glasses.How a phone with a Quad-Core processor is ironically 2x slower than my old phone that had a Dual-Core is completely beyond me. And don't even get me started on the so-called multi-window feature. Why even bother to make a feature that only lets you use about 10 of the apps that nobody ever uses?I will say this though, the things that do actually work well on this phone (almost) make up for the things that don't. The waterproof capabilities (at least so far) do work pretty well and it saves me from the trouble of having to throw away $80 on a life-proof case that isn't even shock absorbent. After one little drop of water lands on the screen, the phone is nearly impossible to use (until you dry it off again).I'm surprised that this phone has as many flaws as it does after hearing so many people say so many good things about Samsung products. Regardless of it's flaws, the phone does have a lot of potential, and with a few more sufficient updates that offer major improvements, could be something great. Other than that, I am on the fence about buying another Samsung product in the future.",2015年4月19日 在美国审核
A Samsung Evolution,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs. With that out of the way, let's get to the point and the nitty gritty, shall we?* THE SCREEN - that is the very first thing you will notice when you look at the S5. Samsung has found its niche with AMOLED screens, which are BRIGHT &amp; SATURATED. Everything almost literally jumps out at you, and sometimes even too much so. I had to switch to the ""natural"" setting, as the ""vivid"" and even ""standard"" profiles are too saturated(and FAKE) for me. It's better as a demo unit to draw you in, but for everyday use, I recommend switching to the natural profile.FACTS: The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with Full HD resolution - 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~432 ppi pixel density, plus Gorilla Glass 3 to protect the screen from scratches.* The Look - the S5 has a more squared-off edges look than the S4, which is more squared off than the S3, but all three are not as angular as the S2. In terms of roundness-to square-ness, it goes from the S3 - S4 - S5 - S2 (the original S just looks like an iPhone 3GS). Check out my images for an easier comparison. The S5 is the tallest and widest, but not the thickest of the Galaxy S's. The best thing I can say about this is it's an evolution. Beauty is subjective, so judge for yourself. The front side is almost the same as any other Galaxy phone: You have the physical Home button, flanked by the ""back"" and ""menu"" capacitive buttons. Probably the most improved aspect of the design is in its functionality - it is now dust-proof, and water-proof up to 3 feet!FACTS: The dimensions are 5.59"" x 2.85"" x 0.32""(142cm x 72.5cm x 8.1cm), and weighs 5.11oz(145g).* The Feel - Samsung has taken a lot of flack for making the Galaxy S line so cheap looking and feeling with its plastic bodies, for being the top Android phone maker. HTC has been known to have the best craftsmanship with their all-metal One phones. Perhaps Samsung feel they are so dominant that they don't have to spend more to mass-produce metal phones, but since they don't want to come off as too arrogant, so their compromise is a dimpled, faux-rubber backside like the Nexus 7(2012) and its very own Galaxy Note 3. It definitely gives a better feel - it doesn't slip and slide in your hands or pockets anymore - but it cannot compare to the feel and craftsmanship of the HTC One(both the m7 and m8). It is on the right track though, so let's hope that rumored luxury ""F"" line or next year's S6 will continue to get better.* How it Runs - This phone is fast, fast, FAST! With a 2.5gHz Snapdragon 801, it has the fastest processor out there right now. It terms of real speed, I cannot say if it is faster than the HTC One m8 or the Sony Xperia Z2, but it is definitely up there. When you touch an app icon to launch it, it launches nearly instantly. To really see how this phone flies, just open the gallery app and scroll through all your photos and you'll see what I mean. Usually the gallery is where most phones stutter as it tries to load all your photos and albums - but NOT the S5!* The Camera - FINALLY! Samsung has decided to make a decent camera, and not just as an afterthought. This 16mp camera is really awesome, so much better than the S4. I would always get washed out images with my S3/S4/Note 2, but with the S5, it actually looks like it's from a decent point-and-shoot dedicated camera with crisp, bright, and saturated images. Low-light shooting is also vastly improved, although not as good as the new HTC One m8. 16mp means 5312 x 2988 -resolution images, so you can actually blow them up or crop them down without fearing the dreaded pixelation monster. There are a myriad of other cool and useful camera features that I will save for you to find out(like macro and ""Google Street View"" modes :]). And lastly, the focus is quick, quick, QUICK! Nearly instantaneous focus allows you to capture those hard-to-capture moments easier. A definitely thumbs up to Samsung for paying attention to the camera and its functions.* Software - I'm still trying to figure out everything, as there is A LOT of stuff under the hood. Samsung's TouchWiz user interface this time around is A LOT less intrusive though, as much as can be without being totally stock Android, I guess. The layout and iconography are flatter and simpler, and for the better in my view. There is also a new sensor on the back, just beneath the camera lens. It is a heart-rate monitor/pedometer, and it comes with its own health app called S Health. There is a new battery-saving mode which can save you precious minutes when you're caught in a bind. All in all, I think this version is a lot nicer-looking, more responsive, and better than the precious S phones.The ultimate question is whether this phone is a worthy upgrade over the S4. As my review title suggests, it is an evolution, an incremental upgrade over the S4. So with that said I cannot whole-heartedly recommend it if you already have a good phone, or even over the S4. But I do feel this upgrade is more vast and much better than from the S3 to the S4, so in that sense Samsung has done a much better job this year. If you are switching from an older phone that was made at least 2 years ago, then I would tell you jump right in and try the S5 - it will not disappoint you. But for those with already a good phone, and/or say you just finished year one of your 2-year contract, then I would say think hard before you make the leap. For my money, I think the Note 4 and S6 will be the bigger upgrades more worth waiting for.",2014年4月23日 在美国审核

Currently the most technologically advanced phone,"I have been up for an upgrade for many months, but nothing piqued my interest until this phone and the HTC One M8 came out.It took me a while to debate between the two phones, but here is what eventually sold me on the Galaxy S5:-Wireless charging option. I plan on getting the replacement back cover and a wireless charger for my desk, as well as a wireless charging car dock-Camera. Higher Megapixels and faster focusing. Low light is still not great, but an improvement. This phone takes pictures very quickly.-Fingerprint scanner. Not as convenient as on the iphone, but still a nice way to unlock the phone.-Battery is replaceable and of significant mAH.-IP67 ratingHere are some other thoughts:-I liked the HTC one M8's dual front speakers, but it added a significant length to the phone, which frankly, all these phones are on the large side already.-I like the aluminum back of the M8, but I know that I would scratch it quickly, it doesn't allow for wireless charging, and is not easily replaceable. In this regard, I actually like that the S5 has a plastic back that is replaceable.-Both HTC and Samsung has some nifty software features with their own flare, and Kit Kat is also nice - on both phones.-the infrared port is fun to play with to control the tv and bluray player, and works quite well.I do plan on adding a tempered glass cover to try out and see how well it works. I am undecided about cases, especially since I intend on wirelessly charging, and the replacement back cover isn't available yet, and most likely will add some thickness. I want to get the wireless charging cover before I look for cases. With the Qi standard, it should be able to charge through the thickness of the case.One reason why I want to wirelessly charge, is to keep the USB 3 door cover closed at all times to retain the IP67 rating, and not have to worry about that as well as wearing out the charging port.Other factors that I generally like about the S5, but were not the deciding factors:-heartbeat sensor-usb 3, faster transfers if I directly connect the phone to the computer, as well as compatibility with a greater number of cables (both 2.0 as well as 3.0 now)-All current wireless standards (including mimo for ac, dual band, etc.)-2.5 Ghz processorThe Galaxy S5 is not THE best in every aspect (I wish it had a better speaker, more abilities from the lock screen, came stock with the wireless charging back, more Ram, etc.), but it is excellent (if not the best) in many areas, and overall for me, was the best option and compromise from what is currently is available.I keep my phones for at least 2 years (my last phone was the Droid Razr MAXX), and I expect to be able to hold on to this phone for at least that length of time considering the features of the S5, especially the battery which tends to be the shortest lasting part of any phone.",2014年4月17日 在美国审核
can't go wrong with this phone,"I took a while to decide what phone to upgrade to. When the HTC one m8 came out I was positive that was the phone for me, I was very unimpressed with its camera. When thever s5 came out, I was disappointed in the gimmicks Samsung took with the phone. However, there are so many features on this phone that truly do improve the experience. Customizing the operating system is fantastic, and many of the internal software features come in handy often. I actually have grown to like the one handed use feature which shrinks the screen to what ever side your tub is on. Samsung does include useless other features, but they all work as advertised.The camera is fantastic, I had an 8 mp camera on my last phone and this is truly better.Plus many of the features on the camera are fun and very useful. In deciding which phone to choose the camera was one of the most important to me and I am happy with the performance of this one.Anyone who reads this should know that buying a flagship device will most often be an improvement over previous devices. I owned a motorola Droid bionic for 2 years, it served me well, but going from that to my Shiney GS5 feels like I moved from a record player to an ipod, or a pinto to a Lamborghini,or apartment to mansion.If you are moving off a two year contract like I did, any flagship device will be a vast improvement,justhe find features that are important to you and decide from there.As a side note, I'm finding the battery life is excellent,batteries themselves have not changedone much, but management of power usage has and the gs5 manages the power exceptionally.

Frustrating application experience,"There are two aspects to any smartphone, the phone itself and the applications you run on the phone. As far as the phone is concerned it is excellent. Fantastic screen, superb performance, great camera and the OS has come a long way since the first Droid days. If these things were the only things to review it would be a 5 star rating from me. However, more important than the phone are the available applications that you can run on the phone. This is where this and ANY other Android phone falls short. It becomes an amazingly frustrating exercise using an Android phone when the applications are total garbage. It's a shame because this aspect of the Android experience is what makes you want to throw the phone on the floor and smash it. Apple may have a restrictive policy when it comes to developing and publishing apps, but I see why Apple has a tighter grip on what apps are approved and published. In the end the phone, whether it be an S5, Droid or an iPhone, will ultimately be rated and reviewed on the application experience and not the phone itself. I have both this S5 and an iPhone and this S5 is in my opinion a better phone. Far better screen, customizable experience, better camera, etc. etc. But it becomes so frustrating using apps on the S5 that I find myself no longer wanting to use it. When applications crash, freeze, or just don't work as they should, you end up blaming the phone and you begin to throw out expletives condemning the phone and not the application. This aspect needs to be improved. If an app is garbage it makes the phone look like garbage and now I find myself wanting to replace it with an iPhone. It's a shame.",2015年1月5日 在美国审核
"Snappy processor, good specs, surprisingly poor camera and tons of bloatware","Note: I have used by S5 for approximately four months at the time of this review.Pros: Relatively responsive, good hardware, good batteryCons: Too much bloatware, overrated camera, connecting charger is weirdly difficult, 16GB goes fast (especially with the bloatware, unless you root your phone and remove...and yeah, I know you can add SD cards, but still), a lot of the gimmicky features don't work wellSummary: So Samsung, for better or worse, has sort of a declining reputation despite selling a whole lot of phones. I think a lot of it has to do with their odd relationship with Google, and more specifically the Android operating system. It is no secret that they are trying to move away from Android, which is quite clear (sometimes painfully) with the Galaxy S5.Sure, it is Android. But along with that comes a lot of Samsung bloatware apps that the vast majority of people would rather not have on their phones. And unfortunately these apps take up a lot of precious space on this 16GB phone.This phone is fairly snappy in terms of performance, although I haven't tried other contemporary flagship phones (e.g. HTC One, Moto X+1, iPhone 6). What kind of surprised me is the poor camera quality, especially since reviewers seemed to sing its praises online. Let's just say that the iPhone 6 takes far superior pictures (and I hate to admit this, as a loyal Android customer).If I could have a do-over, I probably would have bought the Moto X+1 (although it wasn't released at the time I got my phone). Basically something with stock Android.",2014年10月9日 在美国审核

Flimsy charging port cover,"I've had this phone for 2 months. When I first bought it I had my concerns about the sturdiness of the charging cover. It is held on by a tiny plastic piece which is bound to wear down and break off with daily opening and closing to charge. Well, it did break off in 2 months. This was with me being very careful because I didn't trust the cover. It is not covered under ATT warranty. I can mail my phone to Samsung for a couple weeks while they look at it and decide it'll it was my fault or not. Maybe, I would get lucky and they would fix the cover. But what's the point? To do it all over again in 2 months. I don't think so. I just want to buy a case for it that will cover the exposed charging ports (like the ones Otter makes for the Note) but I can't find one so I guess they don't make them. UghAlso, I upgraded from the s2 when I got this phone and I expected a huge improvement in speed. But I continue to have lag with apps, freezing screens, and slow response time.

Questionable manufacturing quality. ....,"When rating this phone, I'd like to compare the same generation of phones.I'd consider the HTC One m8, iPhone 6 series and the Motorola X (2014) are the same generation.It is hard to compare the UI features, as I think it is more personal preference than performance base.However, I do have to note that the home screens are a little over crowed, and features don't have details adjustment/customizing.For example, the ""clock/weather"" widget can't adjust to different size ..I think this a minor issue, not so ""refine"" ...I do not prefer that when I flip to the left, Samsung force the ""My magazine"" or flipboard there.That's take up valuable space!!I don't need that for the whole page .Now I can flip to the left and use that space to organize my apps ..Yes... I do agree that the phone has good screen hardware and above average camera.However, I cannot see how it can justify its build quality comparing to others, especially at over $650 MSRP .And that's the main reason I rated 3 stars.One of my biggest dislikes is the plastic / chrome quality.I use to phone only 3 days, never drop, and usually put in a big semi-empty messenger bag before I can a phone case.Then, I only put in my pocket with some coins, and walk less than 30 min, and the sliver chrome on the edge already come off!!WTH?I expect better than this at $650.Then, the back cover, it really as thin as potato chip,And it doesn't come with charging back cover?!Even the Palm Pre Plus come with it back in 2008.and the back cover was a little thicker too.Overall, I still like the phone, but when comparing to others, it is just average...the overwhelming PLUS that I won't deny are that it has replaceable battery, easy to access expandable memory.If other starts to offer that, Samsung may not be my choose.I still have to wait and see how ""durable"" and ""reliable"" the phone is.It means its general manufacturing quality.HTC phones do have good and impressive hardware and software combination.However, its battery and ""durability"" ( how long it last) is a question.I have other HTC phones, it start dying after 18 mo.Motorola phones that I had were like rock.They don't look or perform impressive.However, they last very long.",2014年11月1日 在美国审核

Hardware is flawed by tremendous BLOATWARE and buggy Samsung software.,"After upgrading from the Galaxy S3, I'm finding the S5 to be a disappointment, mainly due to the software.Verizon appears to continue to push a ton of BLOATware to their new customers - dozens of apps you don't need and you don't want, that crap up your phone and do not reliably inter-operate with Google apps.If you don't switch to their apps, you're constantly hounded.And their apps are inferior to others out there.There's no simple way to migrate from the S3 without losing a bunch of apps and data that don't transfer for some reason - so it took me a whole day to try and get my new phone loaded with some of the data and apps that were on my old phone - the last transition wasn't nearly as painful.I'm still seeing all kinds of problems with things like custom notifications?Forget about it.. while you can add custom ringtones off the SD card, you can't do this with SMS notifications - this is incredibly annoying.You can try copying files to certain directories but maybe they'll work for a little bit, and then the new custom notifications disappear and are no longer available - makes no sense.The hardware appears to be top notch, but the software for this new iteration SUCKS.I'm about to switch from Verizon I'm so tired of having to waste my time cleaning out their crappy, buggy software.",2015年5月4日 在美国审核
I LOVE this phone!,"I've had my S5 for over 1 month. I love everything about it. I bought the S5 because it is the ONLY good phone out there with SD card slot and removable battery. But... I have found that battery life is so good I haven't needed to buy an extra battery.Here is the main reason I am taking the time to write this review. Last weekend I accidentally put the phone in the washer! It was in there at least 15 minutes before I fished it out. It was still on. I shut it off and put it in rice overnight, then dried it under hair dryer. Next day it started up and 100% fine!!! True story. AMAZING!Since I paid $684 for this phone unlocked I was terrified.

"Awesome phone, outrageous upgrade fee","The phone is awesome. The Verizon Upgrade Fee of $30.00 is completely outrageous, though. Not only I did commit to a 2-year contract, but they had to also bill me for basically nothing - I bought the phone from a supplier (Amazon), did the settings on my own and dealt with the mess of the non-working Backup Assistant.Amazon also should have been open about this charge from the beginning of my purchase (so that the cost of a new Samsung Galaxy is not 99.99 but 129.99) and not hide it in the second or third step of the ordering process right after signing the three terms &amp; conditions documents.",2014年8月18日 在美国审核
Best Phone Yet.,"This phone is simply amazing, but anything but simple. Screen on the phone is stunning. The 16MP pictures that it takes are highly detailed and look great. The same can be said for the 4K recording. The fingerprint scanner works fine for unlocking the phone. With the heartbeat sensor and Samsung apps like S-Health, this phone is great for fitness. I really like the IP 67 certification( which means it's dust-proof and waterproof for 30 minutes under a meter of water.). I can now take it with me to the pool or just to listen to music in the shower. The battery last for about 8 hours of continuous use. The USB 3.0 makes data transfer faster than normal phones and the battery charging takes about two hours. the size fits comfortably in the hands. For those with smaller hands, it comes with a one handed operation mode. It's slim body easily fits into the pocket. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",2014年6月24日 在美国审核
It's okay,"This Is not a great phone. The battery life is below average,I suggest that you get open advanced task killer for this phone or it will kill it's own battery. Get a home screen launcher (nova launcher or Google now)because the stock launcher is very difficult to customize. I'm not a fan of the plastic back,I don't like the texture or the way it looks but it does add extra grip, I'm used to a metal iPhone. I do like the expandable storage, my iPhone didn't have that. One thing I have noticed about this phone is that if you tap the back of it it vibrates, which gets very annoying. However it does seem like a rugged phone, I have not managed to scratch it. I do not like this phone's processor, I play a lot of 3d games and it struggles to maintain 45 fps,I have never had 60fps. If you have this phone and have noticed the black circle on the top of the phone, it let's the phone be a TV Remote. Every once in a while the phone's screen goes dead and stops working for a few seconds which is very annoying. The click on the lock screen is very small and hard to see. One thing that drives me crazy is the waterproof cover on the charging port, which I find myself playing with all the time and I feel like taking it off.If you think you can live with these things than you can consider this phone.",2016年5月28日 在美国审核
"Used Phone for 1 year, horrible","By far my least favorite cellphone ever for many solid reasons.After a year daily of use here are my cons:1) Ignore what they say about the cameras for this brand being great, the camera is horrible. For the past year I have had nothing but out of focus and low quality photos. To get a photo in focus is a chance occurrence that often requires great effort. I have had many photos ruined. I have a dogpile of out of focus photos that are disappointing. I'm a professional photographer with a large portfolio, the camera was a major selling point for me - only its been a curse.2) Questionable reception.3) As of the past month Im dealing with lots of issues with the phone being unresponsive and the screen going black when performing simple tasks.This phone fails at surviving regular use, and has not held its value long term.",2016年6月27日 在美国审核

It's good but....,"First off, the S5 is replacing my HTC Rezound.No matter what I would have purchased, it would have been better than the POFS Rezound.The S5 obviously blows the POFS out of the water but there are still some issues. I have had numerous smart phones beginning with the Motorola Q and moving on to the Palm Treo 700W, Blackberry Touch, HTC Incredible, POFS and now the Samsung S5.First off, the camera takes really good pictures but is still really ""grainy"" when I zoom in.I have not tweaked any of the settings in the camera, even though I have had the S5 since April 11th(opening day).In the 22 days that I have had it, it has turned off 3 times on its own.Once, I was listening to music on the Amazon MP3 app and I answered a phone call but when I ended the call, the phone rebooted on it's own.It boots really fast so it's not much of an issue.Two other times, I was downloading apps, and opening/closing certain other apps and it just decided to reboot.These are not deal breakers.One of the things that is complete junk on this phone is the ""fingerprint scanner"" security option.Maybe it is because I have really big hands and fingers, but it would not work at all, period.It registered my fingerprint but it would never allow me to unlock the phone, using that same finger.I turned that option off and just went back to the typical ""pattern"" security option.POFS wouldn't even work when I tried to install Go Launcher Ex so I was looking forward to using it on the Samsung S5.Nope!!I downloaded Go Launcher Ex and was using it for a few days and everything seemed to be working well.I had it on my nightstand, one evening, and when I picked it up, I noticed it was extremely hot.There was a notice on the screen that said that it was overheating and was shutting down most everything on the phone but the bare minimum until it cooled off.Yes, I have a task killer installed and it is running constantly so I do not think that I had too many apps running.The phone was just sitting on the nightstand. I uninstalled Go Launcher Ex and I have not had that issue again.The Health app is pretty cool but I would trust it about as much as our current dictator. This phone uses USB 3.0 chargers but also will work with your older 2.0 chargers and chords.One of the greatest things about the S5 is the amount of time that a charge will last.POFS got about four hours before it died.Yep, four freaking hours!!!I regularly get about sixteen hours of use before the S5 dies and that is on days where I am using it on regular basis.Today, when I hardly used the S5, I unplugged it at 530AM and after almost 12 hours the phone still has 59% available.As a contractor, one of the big things that drew me to this phone was the fact that it was waterproof but the fact that it is ""dustproof"" is my favorite.There is a ""charger cover"" that seals the charging port and keeps the phone ""dust/waterproof"".I am not sure how durable this little piece will be but it seems to be holding up so far.All in all, this is a good phone and most everyone will be happy with it. I would rate it as 3.51 stars. There will always be room for improvement!",2014年5月3日 在美国审核
In it's hayday it was probably a good phone.

I hate my phone,"I hate my phone. I paid for it ($700+) and it started going bad just after the return period ended (14 days). It wasn't too bad, just really laggy but it just got worse. I sent it back with the warranty and got a new one. It worked for several months and then got laggy again, when I say laggy I mean I click the camera and it come on 30 seconds later. If I click on something else in that 30 seconds then when the phone finally starts working it goes crazy jumping around to anything I touched while it was ""processing"". :( Eventually I couldn't stand it anymore and sent it back. I got another new one and right from the box it was laggy, I sent it back and now I am on my 4th Samsung Galaxy S5 or is it my 5th? I lost count. I have had it for 2 weeks, only downloaded 5 essential apps and...lag lag lag. It gets super hot, it just stops working. It times out while its trying to :process"" my command to open an app. Horrible! After 4 or 5 SamGal5's it HAS to be the phone.

"I don't think you'd like it, or at least I didn't","I guess i'm one of the few that really hates this phone.I honestly think Android phones are not up to par w/ iPhones.They're getting close, but if you've had the iPhone first and then going to Android, I don't think you'd like it, or at least I didn't.I didn't pay for this phone, my work did.I got it so I can try it since I wanted to see how I'd like Android.Here are my gripes or the bugs I experience w/ the S5;- Camera functions lag.When you think you got a good stable shot, it always turns out slightly blurred or you moved just a bit at the end.After you finished the shot, everything else freezes for a second, so you can't do anything but wait for a few seconds.- When i'm calling and switching from call to dial numbers, screen always flickers and phone or sensors gets confused.It's like its caught up in the middle of switching the screen so it won't let you dial any numbers- When I'm calling and using the good ol' leaning the phone against my shoulders so I can use my hands to write or grab stuff, it always hits different keys for some reason.It switches modes or it ends up hanging up.Very annoying during a call- Way more ads than iPhone.- Harder to adjust your app settings- Android touch is not as smooth as iOS- Android is not as smooth as iOS period.For example, if theres a link that opens up a video, half the time, your messing around the screen trying to get the videos to maximize and minimize.When there are drop down menus, most of the time, half of the menus are displayed and you can't scroll over to see the rest.On the plus side, i like the big screen and the high resolution for videos.",2014年12月16日 在美国审核
Lollipop creates problems,"The phone has some great features - big vivid screen, great camera for outside landscape shots and only good to acceptable in medium to low light or high light indoor conditions. When you look up a contact or phone number by a person's name, even if you type the entire name in it will bring up lots of other related contacts and you have to scroll to find the exact match. VERY FRUSTRATING. The new lollipop upgrade is unhelpful and requires a lot of changes to get the original easy volume, mute and vibrate settings. You have to go to Android Central to figure it out because the phone changes the settings you used previously. You will lose some functionality. The battery runs down fast because the phone doesn't close apps you are not longer using. You have to remember to close all frequently to save battery life.

"Amazing screen, sweet power sipping mode, IR blaster, great camera, fingerprint secured, and water and dust resistant!","THE CHARGERPlease note that while the S5 has a special looking port for charging (a USB 3.0 port) you CAN use the old charger from one of your other Android powered devices!It just happens to charge really really quickly if you use a USB 3.0 cable, but it's not necessary to do so.AMAZING SCREENThis display is nicer than any I have ever seen. It is so sharp I cannot see individual pixels with my naked eye. It's also bright, very bright! It's perfectly usable on a bright sunny day at noon without a cloud in the sky. In really bright conditions, the screen boosts the maximum allowable brightness when the auto-brightness feature enabled! So if it's extremely bright outside, leave the auto-brightness feature enabled. Unlike in previous iterations, it is superbly implemented anyway, so I'd recommend leaving it on regardless. I upgraded from the S3, and I immediately noticed the 1080P resolution, the whiter whites, darker blacks, extremely realistic and still vibrant colors, and even the capability of dimming the screen much more effectively (which is really nice when using the phone in bed).The Super AMOLED screen seems to have been perfected in this device!You have to see it to believe it, this is a stunningly beautiful 1080P display that knocks the competition out of the park. The size of the screen is a big plus in my opinion, as well and is especially fantastic given its...CONVENIENT MULTITASKING CAPABILITIESYou can run two programs on the screen at the same time, in a split window arrangement.The really fast processing ensures that doing so doesn't cause lags.Even with two apps sharing the screen, the phone's operation is butter smooth.And the 5 inch display means that you have plenty of real estate for both apps.INSANELY AWESOME ULTRA-POWER SAVING MODEThis thing is for real. With 10 percent power left, you get usability the rest of the day. The S5 has a super amoled screen, so black pixels don't draw any power as opposed to back-lit LCD screens in which a black pixel is really just a pixel in which the backlight has been blocked. Ultra-power saving mode turns the screen black and white, and gives you a jet-black interface with up to six black and white icons.This means that a tiny fraction of the pixels are powered.This mode also reduces the screen frame rate, shuts down two of the phone's four cores, reduces in half the speed of the remaining two cores, shuts down almost all background processes, disables most apps, and sips power all the while letting you text, call, and surf the web. You can check your email via the web, but can't use the email or gmail apps. Basically it turns your phone into one of those old brick phones that lasted forever. That's pretty sweet in a pinch!At 100% power, activating ultra-power saving mode gives you 12 DAYS of standby time!I figure with regular use I'd get a week. You could literally charge your phone to 100% before a week-long vacation, flip on ultra power-saving mode, use your phone normally (calling, texting, and some web surfing) and probably make it the entire week without having to charge it. I'd love to test that theory. But suffice it to say that gone are the days of needing to worry about a dead phone when you're out all day and don't have access to a charger.THE SECURITY OF A FINGERPRINT SCANNERIt takes some getting used to, but once you set up your fingerprints, you can easily activate the phone by swiping your finger or thumb (I set mine up for one-handed use using my thumb, and after a week, it registers on the first try just about every time). No one else can access my phone and should I try and fail to unlock the phone too many times, I can then enter a password to unlock it. I had to do that a few times the first day of use. But with frequent use, I quickly learned to unlock my phone on the first attempt. I am a huge fan of the fingerprint scanner.IR BLASTERI can use the IR blaster to operate my TV. Along with Bluetooth and WiFi, the infrared blaster basically gives you the chance to make your phone a universal remote!WATER AND DUST RESISTANTI love that you could accidentally drop the phone in a puddle or have it fall out of your shirt pocket into the toilet, sink, or bathtub and you'll be just fine. It's nice that a downpour won't short-circuit your phone, and it's pretty spectacular that if you forgot to take the phone out of your pocket before doing a load of laundry, you'd likely retrieve a perfectly operable phone from the washing machine. Not sure about dust resistance, I never had a phone die from dust, but I'm guessing it's happened before and it's nice that it won't with this phone.CAMERAIt's a behemoth. It's a 16 megapixel camera that takes beautiful and sharp pictures. It takes great low-light pics without the need for activating the camera flash. I used it during my Nephew's baptism recently. My aunt saw the pictures on my screen as I took them and reviewed them. After the baptism, she looked at my phone and said, ""Your phone takes such beautiful pictures! I'd rather have a phone that takes pictures like that than this thing (she was holding up her really nice digital camera)!DESIGNIt's functional. The S5 is made of a nice looking textured soft-feeling plastic that I think looks quite premium and is reminiscent of perforated leather (although the plastic is panned in almost every official review--I like it). Mine is white and looks fantastic, but isn't quite as soft as the black variant--which is actually a dark grey rather than black.Nonetheless it feels nice in the hand and doesn't get as hot or cold as metal gets. It has better grip than metal, and that's important to me. You don't want to go around dropping a premium phone. And because it's flexible, the plastic cover pulls right off the back of the phone so you can replace the battery (which isn't really necessary with Ultra-power saving mode--see above), or add some extra storage with MicroSD card slot.My only complaint design-wise is that the ""chrome"" side of the phone is painted plastic.I've dropped it a few times and the chrome paint chips off very easily, and on this phone it serves a very important purpose.The screen is slightly recessed, so the chrome takes a beating if you drop it.It should be a durable unpainted metal that doesn't chip or scratch.THE NEGATIVEThe only negative I've seen, besides the painted chrome plastic part of the phone that chips really easily, is the loudness of the speaker. It doesn't get all that loud. Some people complain about the plastic back cover.I love it.It's functional, grippy, and attractive. I prefer the textured plastic to just about anything else. Others actually complain about the port cover! To them I say BOO-FREAKING-HOO! Oh no, a cover that lets your phone survive a tumble through the freaking washing machine! How truly awful!THE VERDICTUltimately the S5 looks really nice, stays alive forever (as far as modern smart phones go, anyway), can be used as a universal remote, has an incredibly bright and stunningly beautiful display that is readable in the direct light of the sun, has a fantastic camera, has a really convenient and pretty sure proof security system with the fingerprint scanning set up, can survive a tumble through the washing machine as well as lots of dust, and has a plastic design that allows for the immediate and screw-less opening of the device for the swapping of a battery or the addition of a MicroSD card! Five stars? Well, since you can't give 4.8 stars (minus 0.1 for the speaker that isn't loud enough and another 0.1 for the plastic chrome painted side that chips too easily), yep!",2014年5月15日 在美国审核

I expected much better.,"Coming from an iPhone 5, I expected much better. After riding the iPhone bandwagon for years, I thought it would be a great time to switch over to Android and give it a shot.

Have to clear text messages every other day to speed phone upThis phone has so many software problems I can't even begin to get into detail. Its a shame that this phone has such amazing hardware but the software it utilizes is garbage. I feel as if this phone can't allocate RAM properly. The point of having such a fast processor and 2 Gb of RAM is so that multitasking is smooth but this is not the case. If I receive a notification while I'm in an application, the application freezes for a few seconds. God forbid I receive a few notifications in a row... I went to the store recently and played with the latest LG phones and these literally blow the S5 out of the water. The only good thing about this phone is that it takes amazing pictures in daylight. My friends love this phone, so I'm not really sure why I've had such bad experiences with this phone. My charging port wont seal properly, so I'm going to get a replacement and see if it was just my phone in particular that was causing all of these issues.

Worst product ever!,"The only thing this company(CellU4Less) has is quick service.

I contacted the company; explained the situation and they reimbursed me with a new phone and charger which I had to pay shipping and handling for. This way, I paid more for the phone than its cost price. Six months after my replacement phone was received, the battery became swollen and had to be replaced!

Great phone except for the charging port,"I have had the phone for a week now...and I really love it...except...the charging port.The charging port has a door, which is located at the bottom of the phone.This makes it impossible to use any type of charging dock with the exception of a wireless dock, which by the time you get a new back for the phone and the charging pad, is another $100.I would pay the money, but that also means that I can't use a case for the phone unless I take it out of the case every time I charge.On the bright side, the camera in this phone totally rocks.It has downloadable effects (filters) that you can use, the capibilities are endless.I like the ""private"" mode and the ""kids"" mode.Both work with the fingerprint scanner. Private mode allows you to put things like your Christmas shopping list, or photos etc, in an area that no one else can tell is even there. Kids mode allows you to choose what the child has access to.The camera filters for children are adorable!They have age related games for children of all ages as well.What a plus when trying to keep a child busy or quiet in an unexpected situation!Charging is quick and the battery life is good...yesterday I went the entire day using only 18% of the battery...went to bed with 82% left.

I have a work phone that is iOS (iPhone 5 if that matterrs) and this phone as my personal phone.Having used both for over a year I can now give a pretty accurate assessment.The short version is that this phone sucks.It's slow, somewhat buggy.Extremely prone to turning on when it's in your pocket.Very prone to sending calls to voicemail when I get it out of my pocket.Overall I'd give it one star.It's just a chore to use.Of the 3 or 4 Android phones I've used, I'd most comparre this to the Samsung Moment (another bomb in my book, seems like a trend).",2015年4月1日 在美国审核

"service randomly dropping when in known service areas with previously great reception, not receiving calls at all while in ...","I've owned this phone for two years as of the 24th. For the past 6 months I've had glaring problems out it, including but not limited to: device resetting when making a call or answering a call, bootloop with no discernable pattern to avoid, Wi-Fi and bluetooth refusing to turn on after working for a period of time with no pattern (sometimes weeks, sometimes minutes, sometimes days), overheating, volume turning itself up and down, service randomly dropping when in known service areas with previously great reception, not receiving calls at all while in service area with great reception, randomly running setup wizard for no reason, and the list goes on.This was a great phone, fast, and never really lagged in any instance. The 16gb storage is a bit small but the 128gb sd capacity makes up for that. 5gb+ is taken up by system memory though so you really only get 10~ish gb for internal storage. Came with quite a bit of bloatware from Verizon but they can be disabled. The phone speaker was loud, and by far the loudest of my peer's phones and of any I've ever had. The charging port cover broke off after 2 weeks of having the phone. The 3.5mm jack now also causes an issue to where audio will not come out of the top call speaker, and I am forced to used speaker phone to make calls, unless I reset my phone, which will put it in a boot loop from 5 minutes to 12 hours.No water damage, no mishandling. Most of the problems started after lolipop update and no amount of recovery steps could fix them. I'd love to believe they're hardware issues, but considering the phone is capable of working perfectly and these problems seem to happen for no clear reason, I can't say it is. Beyond the 3.5mm jack issue, that one is pretty cut and dry but it is also the only instance where I may have actually caused some damage when I stepped out of my vehicle with the jack still in attached to the tape player adaptor and it ripped out. If you don't plan to install a custom ROM, I'd highly suggest avoiding this phone. Verizon's OTA upgrades have pretty much ruined mine.",2016年4月20日 在美国审核
Samsung should be very ashamed for the defective S5.  You can't believe a word that Verizon says.,"Samsung should be very ashamed for the defective S5The fingerprint reader works just well enough to make you think it might.The voice dial is a sick joke.Sometimes I initiate from a Bluetooth 4.0 headset only to have a voice answer out of the phone still on my belt.Samsung should fire some engineers.The fingerprint reader might actually get them sued.I have to admit that I am truly astounded by the incompetence of Verizon Wireless customer service.I spent some amount of time on the phone and was told that I could keep my existing plan, trade in any smart phone and just pay $100 (maybe plus another $40) to get a Galaxy S6.I was told that I could go to a Best Buy mobile in a neighboring city and pickup the S6 phone.The rep assured me that she was updating the notes on my account for the Best Buy representative.Before driving over 30 miles I called and spoke to the Best Buy manager.After looking up my account he informed me that they do not have access to the notes on my account and went on to explain that the representative had given me total misinformation and any upgrade would cause me to lose my grandfathered plan.But wait, there's more!!!So then I call and ask to speak to a manager and the rep insists that I explain everything to her why I want a manager and finally puts me on hold where I waited until disconnected.Then I called back in and the representative told me that managers did not speak directly with customers so I shared with him that I would then spend my time posting reviews about VerizonWireless.I have never encountered a company like VerizonWireless where EVERY TIME you call you will get a completely different story.I hardly think my words will do anything to lower VerizonWireless's reputation on the web since it seems there is no lower place for it to go but just felt to try anyway.Verizon Wireless had me contact them privately on Facebook to resolve the issue which turned out to be an insulting waste of my time when all they did was say their standard blurb.You cannot believe a word that any customer service rep says on the phone.Verizon Wireless will NOT honor any promises made by their representatives.",2015年5月21日 在美国审核

Called verizon tech support but they couldn't do anything.2) battery life is okay, but not great.Granted I use my phone a lot, but I expect a phone this big to have a battery that will get me through the day and this often does not.Why can't Power Saving Mode or Ultra Power Saving Mode be enabled when the battery reaches a certain %? It has to be manually enabled? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose?3) the volume is low. Can barely hear folks on speaker in my car.

After putting me on hold for a couple minutes, she told me that I would have to send the charger to them with the receipt. They would evaluate it to be sure there was no damage, and then send me another. This would take up to 11 days. Happily, I have the charger from my previous phone.

Samsung Sells Defective Products(Non-Water Resistant S5's) They Wont Stand By,"I purchased a Galaxy S5 in February. As I'm sure you know the S5 is advertised as IP67 certified against water and dust. This Ingress Protection rating means the phone should handle any level of dust without being harmed, AND THE PHONE SHOULD NOT BE DAMAGED WHEN IMMERSED IN WATER UP TO 1 METER FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF HOUR. Earlier this week I waded to a boat with the phone in my pocket. Before doing so I made sure both the back cover and the charger cover were COMPLETELY sealed. The phone was no more than a foot under water at any time, and was under water for less than a minute. After finishing boating I waded back to shore with the phone in my pocket. Again, the phone was no more than a foot under water at any time, and was under water for less than a minute. Upon getting back on shore I checked my phone. Although the back cover and the charger cover were still COMPLETELY sealed, the screen would not turn on. I opened the back cover and saw water had gotten inside. The phone is now dead.I called Samsung's number, and the man I spoke with said that although the phone was still under warranty, the warranty does not cover water damage. Thus he said I could send it to a Samsung technician, but I would have to pay for it's repair. I then emailed Samsung. ESSENTIALLY THEY ADMITTED THE PHONE SHOULD HAVE HELD UP UNDER THE CONDITIONS I EXPOSED IT TO, BUT “ANY PHYSICAL OR LIQUID DAMAGE ON THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.” Since the phone was advertised as being able to handle the conditions I exposed it to, and I know other people have used their S5’s the same way and their phones held up, it’s obvious my phone was defective. But Samsung won’t stand by their product. Not only that a friend had the exact same thing happen to his S5, and Samsung had the same response. SO DON’T BUY A SAMSUNG, THE COMPANY IS SLEAZY, AND MAKES DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THEY WON’T REPLACE, OR FIX ON THEIR DIME.",2015年7月8日 在美国审核

... get a Samsung Galaxy S5 because it has a bad battery life,"Samsung Galaxy S5 People should never get a Samsung Galaxy S5 because it has a bad battery life, it can’t get 4G, and it has a bad back cover. I’ve used a large variety of cell phones, so you should trust my expert opinion. First, on the Samsung Galaxy S5, the battery life doesn’t last very long. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 at home and it will die after an hour of using it. Secondly, it also can’t get 4G anywhere. I was trying to download a song, and it wouldn’t let me if I wasn’t connected to WiFi. Lastly, the cover on the back won’t connect together in some places. I took off the cover to change the battery, and it wouldn’t go back on in some places, it annoyed me half to death. Even though it is true that the Samsung Galaxy S5 has good size and is pretty fast, those don’t make up for the fact that it has bad battery life, it can’t get 4G, and the stupid back cover won’t connect.

Waterproof for a while.,"Overall it is a nice enough phone, but for the phone to be waterproof, you have to keep the usb cover closed.Unfortunately you have to open the usb cover to charge the phone.The usb cover is a very cheap plastic cover attached via a very small plastic band.This plastic band wears out and the cover breaks off from the phone.Hence no waterproof phone.If you really want a waterproof phone, look elsewhere or at least read up on the issue of broken usb covers and decide if you want to deal with this hassle.Oh, Samsung will maybe replace your phone under warranty if this happens as long as you give them your phone for 2 weeks and they decide that the cheap plastic was defective and didn't break because you opened the cover too hard.So you can either ignore the waterproof claim, buy a wireless charging cover, or never charge your phone.Do any of those and you are golden.Do anything else and you are at the mercy of Samsung's customer service.Good luck with that.",2014年6月4日 在美国审核
"Very disappointing smart phone. Samsung software slows down and hinders the phone. Bad camera, difficult to text, poor quality.","This is my most regretted purchase. I am nothing but disappointed with the phone. It's incredibly overpriced for the low quality Samsung continues to deliver. I upgraded from the S2 which had it's fair share of problems but I wasn't prepared for how many problems the S5 had. I'll make a list and add to it as I remember problems because there are far too many to list all at once.Notifications: text notifications will not go away for 10-30 seconds after reading the new message. Voice mail notifications sometimes wont show up for several days after you receive a voicemail.Texting / swype word recognition: Word recognition is abysmal. Texting someone ""What's up?"" is a chore with this phone. The S5 on average gets about 50% of the words I'm trying to type correct. Some common changes it forces are: What to Ehartt, Something to Simmering, and many more. Most of the time it corrects the intended word to a word that I don't even believe exists. I've also had common words change to a foreign language.Touch pad recognition: somehow there is an inherent lag or delay associated with Samsung's software and the touch pad response time. This probably contributes to the very poor word recognition when texting as stated above. Sometimes I will be using the touch screen and it wont even recognize the touches. Other times, it will recognize a very light touch as a swipe and call someone unintentionally. I have never drunk called anyone until I got this phone. I pulled it out at the bar once to reply to a text from my girlfriend and in the motion of simply putting the phone back into my pocket it decided to call her. She woke up to a 20 minute voice mail of my phone in my pocket.Camera: GARBAGE. Do not believe any of the hype or specs. A powerful camera is useless if it is unable to take a clear picture without contorting your body and standing still for 10 seconds while it tries to focus. This is the absolute most difficult camera I have ever used. I was surprised how powerful this camera looked on paper. As soon as I tried the camera for myself I was a bit confused. A good portion of the pictures come out blurry. Unless you have direct sunlight or a professional photography studio it can be difficult to get the camera to focus. More often than not I find myself standing in uncomfortable positions staring at the phone screen while it tells me to stay still while it tries to focus. I've had multiple people ask me to use a different camera to take detailed photos of the items I'm selling because of this. I feel like a disposable camera would be better sometimes.Speaker is pathetic. You can easily mute your phone unintentionally just by holding it a certain way or laying it on a bed or other surface that would cover the speaker. I've slept through multiple alarms on full volume and I am a light sleeper. Listening to any music on the phone is not recommended, any bass rattles the plastic case.Plastic case: Get used to this rattling. When I have the phone in my pocket I can hear the case rattle and creak with every single step I take. Just now I was changing the SD card and a plastic clip on the back plate of the phone broke off.Fingerprint scanner: Doesn't work 2/3 times. Remember your password! I tried it for a month or two before I got sick of entering my password and just changed the screen lock to a password.",2015年7月2日 在美国审核

Never should have switched from the IPhone!,"Here is the short version: inthe 5 weeks or so that I have had the S5, I have called ATT and Samsung at least a dozen times.Among the issues: 1) apps disappear from the home page; 2) home and lock screen pictures disappear and have to be reset; 3) ring tones disappear and have to be reset; 4) contacts multiply; 5) turn on camera and hold the phone horizontally and the phone switches back to the home page; 6) the time changed on its own-- it is now an hour off.We've reset the phone to original factory settings twice.A replacement is on its way, but unfortunately I am outside of the 30 days that ATT gives for turning the phone in.

The phone fails to be a good at making phone calls with Bluetooth or headset,The phone fails to be a good at making phone calls with Bluetooth or headset.This phone does not work with integrated Bluetooth in my car.It does not reconnect and when I do connect and make calls people I am talking to cannot hear.I have to disconnect and talk directly with the phone. All of this worked great on my S3 phone.When I use a headset plugged in the people I am talking to all complain about an echo.When I try to use the speaker phone the people I talk to cannot hear.In short the only way this phone makes a descent phone call is a standard call stuck to the side of your head.Another problem I have is when I play music.It makes a pop noise at the start of every song.Try hooking it up to a stereo with a wire and you will hear it very loud on every song.,2014年9月22日 在美国审核

Both Bluetooth and USB will keep resetting connection after approximately 2mins and there is no way to get it back working unless you reconnect phone. I spent few hours reading forums and blogs about this issue and to my surprise even Lexus owners experience same issue.This has something to do with Mass Storage Device compatibility that current KitKat OS does not support.

Love this phone!,"Absolutely love this phone.I switched from the iphone 4s and am very happy.I was nervous about switching since I have been a long time iphone user but I can say from what I have experienced so far I feel confident I made the right choice.So far I have found a few little things that have made me really enjoy the switch.The obvious screen size and resolution on the Galaxy S5 are a huge upgrade from the iphone.The camera and video quality is also far superior on the Galaxy S5. The keyboard that appears when entering text is highly superior to the outdated iphone version.It may sound small but it is one of my favorite features.The keyboard has numbers across the top which saves me time from jumping from an alpha keyboard to a number keyboard, which is extremely helpful when entering passwords etc.Also you have the ability to access other characters such as commas, questions marks, dollar sign, @, and colon from the main keyboard by holding down the corresponding letter, which is another huge time saver.The auto correct and suggestions based on what you are typing is much better - it is easier to select suggestions, the suggestions are more relevant and also include previous entires such as email addresses, and it is easier to decline the suggestions or auto-corrections.A few other small things that I really enjoyed was the ease of manipulating photos for wallpaper/background.I have trouble cropping and using an image on my iphone but was easily able to accomplish it on the Galaxy.I also found the alarms much easier to set, customize, and create a recurring schedule for.I haven't gotten to test everything yet and I do have to set up and get used to using Double Twist (downloaded app) to replace itunes for my music but so far I am so happy with my switch from an iphone.Obviously people have different needs, opinions, and biases on what they want in a phone but I am very happy with the features and ease of use of the Galaxy S5 over the iphone.",2014年4月16日 在美国审核

Great Specs - Average Phone,"This phone is frustrating.It has top of the line specs and most all the features you could ever want in a phone.Yet the overall experience is lacking.I bought this phone for a few reasons:Expandable storage, optional inductive charging, and water resistance. This is the only phone on Verizon to offer all of this.Physically, this phone is light although a bit large for the screen size compared to the LG G2 and Nexus 5.I have read this is due to the water resitance.If so, it's a compromise I can live with.The back of the black (dark charcoal) one is dimpled and slightly soft-touch, which I like.The white one I looked at in the store was NOT soft touch.I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere else.There is a plastic chrome strip going around the outside.Normally I don't mind chrome, but the ridged edge on the S5, combined with the plastic chrome volume and power button and dimpled back looks tacky.There is also a door you need to pry up to access the USB port.I don't mind because I like the water resistance and plan on getting an inductive charging back for it.It generally looks nice, but not nearly as nice as most of its competitors.It doesn't creak and make noise when handling as Samsungs have been known to in the past.Online drop tests seem to indicate it is a durable design, so personally I don't really care about how ""premium"" it looks. I much prefer a grippy soft touch plastic to slippery metal that is prone to scratches.The home button/print scanner is a physical button rather than capacitive.At first I didn't think I'd like it, but then I realized it also turns it on which is nice.I still don't know if I like it, but I don't mind.There are also capacitive back and multitask buttons along the bottom.I do wish they weren't invisible when not lit up and swapped like on other Android phones, but I am glad they are there rather than just having on-screen buttons that take up screen space like on the Nexus 5.The screen looks nice.Frankly, I think 1080 screens are overated and find 720 screens just as nice.I don't hold the phone up to my nose after all.In regular use, I don't find the resolution to be much if any improvement over my old EVO qHD screen.Brightness and color are much better though.On to the features.The main selling points of this phone over others seem to be the water resistance, heartrate monitor, and fingerprint scanner.The heartrate monitor requires you to be still and quiet.In other words, it's pretty useless and should not factor into your decision at all.The water resistance is a great feature I think every phone should have.I don't plan on torture testing it but there are videos online of it surviving an hour under water, a pot of boiling water, and a washing machine.This is an important feature for me as I spend a lot of time outdoors.The fingerprint scanner is good enough that I continue to use it.I have both thumbs and a finger set up.It would be nice to have one more finger available to use to cover all the ways I hold the phone.It's a bit picky that you swipe straight down, keep contact with the button, and don't go too fast.But once you get it down it works OK.What really lets this phone down is Samsung's TouchWiz interface.While it offers a lot of features, some more useful than others, it is also laggy, clumsy, arguably ugly and overall just not an elegant interface.Yes, I can use a launcher or root it or whatever, but then I'd lose the features it offers.Two years ago that kind of thing was acceptable on Android, but I don't feel it is today.There's no getting around the lag.I don't understand how anybody can claim it doesn't lag.Scrolling is often not smooth.There is a slight pause every time you select something.All around you will find random stutters and jitters.The camera is especially bad, often taking 6-7 seconds to snap a picture when first starting up.This is not an Android thing as the MotoX, G2, One M8 and Nexus 5 all do not suffer from this. I wouldn't call it terrible, but it really puts a damper on the overall experience.That's not to say this is a slow phone.It's very fast once it does start to do something.But there's a difference between fast and fluid. This phone is not fluid, especially compared to an iPhone or Windows Phone.It always feels a step behind in its reactions.If you look on forums you will find a lot of complaints about this and also a lot of ""fixes"" that include reducing or disabling animations.I've done all that and it really doesn't matter.The tradeoff of course is all the features TouchWiz gives you.There are a ton of customizations you can do to make it function just the way you want.Oddly though, you cannot change the color scheme from the default teal and pastel.This is the first cell phone I've owned in the past 10 years that didn't allow that, which is puzzling considering the point of something like TouchWiz is to make the phone more customizable.It was also a bit complex getting everything setup the way I wanted.Not very cohesive.That could just be unfamiliarity with TouchWiz.The default email app, for whatever reason, tells you to use the Gmail app for Gmail.I'm not sure why this is.I setup Gmail anyway on the default app and it seems to work fine so far.The IR blaster is kind of neat but not real useful.The ""Smart Remote"" to use it is lacking.It can turn things on and off, adjust volume, and do other basic things but it's not going to replace my Harmony remote.Or any of my remotes.It's pretty weak and needs to be pointed almost directly at stuff to work, which is understandable when you see the size of it.The camera, once it gets around to snapping a picture, is fantastic.Easy to use, great quality, just great all-around for a phone.Plenty good enough to replace my old point-and-shoot Sony camera, but not my DSLR of course.The trouble with lag seems to be worse when opening the first time in lower light situations and it can be aggravating.I saw there is a patch to address this but I don't have it yet.All around phone funtionality is good.Radio strength, sound quality, speed, contact functionality are all good.Maybe not the best out there, but pretty solid.Speaker quality is OK but not as good as some other phones.It's good enough that I don't have trouble in the car with it.The virtual keyboard is the best I've used.It's accurate and does swype, predictive text, and has an extra row on top for numbers.Contact dialing/texting is fast and easy.The S5 does support inductive charging which I plan to use.It should come standard though and not require a new $30 cover.The charging cover also adds a bit of bulk, so that the camera is recessed a bit rather than raised.So if you get that some cases may not work with it.Battery life has been OK.It makes it through a day fine with my use.Probably average by today's standards.There's no way for me to compare it to any other recent phone with my personal use so I won't try.The USB3 charger charges it in about 90 minutes which is great.What's not as great is you can't use the included USB3 cable on older microUSB devices.You can, however, still use standard microUSB cables to charge the phone, so that's not a big deal.There are a ton of features on this phone so I won't keep going on and on.The bottom line for me is that this phone offers the main features and functions I wanted but Samsung needs to do a lot better with the overall cohesiveness and fluidness of TouchWiz.There's really no excuse for it with Android KitKat.As for other phones, I like the MotoX but the muddy camera was a dealbreaker.The LG G2 was nice but water resistance and conventional buttons on the side rather than the back won out.I didn't like the slippery metal case and on-screen buttons on the HTC One M8.iPhone was never an option, way too small and I hate how simplistic iOS is and how closed their ecosystem is.Nice, but not for me.Also looked at a Nokia Icon since I love Windows RT on my Surface.Windows Phone OS is slick and the phone is just very nice all-around.Windows has certainly come a long ways, but it's not all the way there yet.Things like the phone dialer and email aren't all that great.Ultimately it was the features and Android ecosystem that Samsung won me over with.There are just a lot of good phones out there today, which is why I give this an average rating.I got it on sale, I probably would not have paid full (contract) price for it over a MotoX.For a hundred dollars more it was worth it, but only because I wanted a good camera to take family pictures with.",2014年5月14日 在美国审核

Buyer Beware: Galaxy S5 is NOT Water Resistant!!!!,"Buying a Galaxy S5 was a HUGE MISTAKE. Save your money.I had such a bad experience with this phone and Samsung Customer Service, I'm making it my life's mission to tell you all about it.I would rant about how its promised ""ultra power saving mode"" is a load of crap (my battery barely lasts 8 hours), but let's focus on Samsung's empty promise of water resistance and craptacular technical supportFirst, I purchased my Galaxy S5 December 2015.I loved it's promises of resistance to ""sweat, rain, liquids, sand and dust, so your phone is protected for any activity and situation.""These situations obviously do not cover spilling tea on your lap, or, perhaps, tea is not included in their list of approved ""liquids.""That's all it took.A cup of scalding hot tea spilled in my lap whilst I had my Galaxy S5 in my back pocket.After leaping around the house and stripping myself of my lava-soaked clothing, I wiped the phone off, confident of its ability to stem the tide of my steaming Earl Grey. Oh what a fool was I.My phone started acting a bit fritzy and wouldn't charge.I took the phone in to Best Buy and the Samsung rep took the back cover off and found moisture under the battery.Turns out my charging port stopped working. WHAT THE HELL?!?!I let it dry in some rice, but nothing worked.Damage was done.I had read that faulty charging ports are a thing, so I contact Samsung to see if they could fix it.I contacted Samsung and the online chat service was polite and concise.The rep asked me to mail my phone in (oh yeah, the shipping and packaging cost $15) and they said Samsung would evaluate it.I tracked my phone on Samsung's convenient tracking system, and they had my phone ONE DAY.ONE FREAKING DAY.I thought, ""Wow!They are quick.They replaced my charging port and shipped it out the next day.""HORSE S***!They returned my phone and the documents said ""Water Damage. Corrosion.Your phone is unable to be repaired.""Now, if I want a replacement I have to file an insurance claim and pay, get this, a $200 deductible.Buyer beware.This phone promises water resistance, and the company promises customer service, but my broken phone determines that is a lie.Stick with your iPhone if you are considering a change.I had one for two years, and while I'd break a screen every 8 months, at least the phone still works.",2015年3月30日 在美国审核
