Good quality for being refurbished,"Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&amp;T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.",2018年7月4日 在美国审核
Just don't do it.,"Leason learned with this one.I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.Don't do it.It's not worth it.Just get a new phone.",2018年12月15日 在美国审核
A great phone from a great seller!,"I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8in 5 minutes tops.I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!",2019年3月28日 在美国审核

Perfect,"I usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new. I found this listing and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were. I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that I could be assured that this would be a good purchase. They were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and Apple.I received the product and it was in MINT condition. The phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever. It has been working perfectly for 4 months now, and I could not be happier with my purchase.The packaging clearly wasn't original and the charger was not OEM, but this is stated in the product description so I knew what I was getting into. No big deal.If you're the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about $100, this is an excellent option for you.Additionally, I had no problems switching this phone over on my Verizon account. As long as you are a Verizon customer, this should be an easy process through the Verizon app.Thanks!",2019年1月21日 在美国审核
Works Great But Here's A Tip For Straight Talk Users,"Have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great.It is an iPhone 8, 64GB model.It looks brand new and everything functions as it should.A note to Straight Talk users.That is my carrier and when I put my Straight Talk SIM card in this phone it works great but I went to the Straight Talk website and logged in so I could transfer my new phone and register it.The website kept giving me an error when I entered the phone's IMEI or serial number so I called Straight Talk support.<br>After working with me for a while, the rep said ""You can't use your current SIM card because you have an unlocked phone.You are going to have to buy a new SIM card and then register that and the new phone with our ""Bring Your Own Phone"" system on the website.""I asked if I did that could I keep my phone number and he said yes.I did some research online and got the impression the the Bring Your Own Phone is not for existing customers, but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers.Not sure about that, but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is, I am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new SIM and trying to register it with Straight Talk.I think they don't want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the Straight Talk website or an authorized supplier so I am leaving well enough alone.The phone works fine with my SIM card, the only thing is that on the Straight talk website it shows I have a Samsung Galaxy instead of an iPhone 8.No harm, no foul.</br>",2019年12月31日 在美国审核
Basically Brand New,"I was looking for a reasonably priced iPhone 8 and happened to stumble upon this phone. I was skeptical at first because it was the cheapest I could find anywhere online, however, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. The phone was advertised as a renewed phone that could vary on the degree of visual usage and battery health. Aside from one scratch on the back glass, the phone is flawless. The battery is also running at 100% capacity which was one of the most important categories for me when buying a new phone. I also checked the IMEI number and model number to find out more information. I was very happy to find that the phone was only 8 months old, and basically brand new with all original parts. This checked all the boxes and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. For any one that cares my order was fulfilled by CR Land, who has their orders fulfilled by amazon. You can feel safe knowing that if you have to return your item or have any issues you will be dealing with amazon directly. You will not be dealing with the store front who supplies the product which is a plus since amazons return process is relatively painless. I would definitely recommend this product to another person just make sure you watch the prices, they often change and you may miss out on a deal that is up to $40 less than what is usually offered.",2019年5月10日 在美国审核

I cannot tell if these are originals.EarphonesHave always used 3rd party so not getting a set was not a deal breaker.Phone ConditionBody is in very good condition. There are paint flecks on the corners, maybe dropped on a hardwood floor, it is smooth to the touch, not deep so it does not appear to have been dropped on concrete, pavement or other rough surface and it is not a light scratch from carrying it in a pocket.Screen ConditionIt came with a screen protector already applied. If there are any scratches I cannot tell. With the protector on, it looks pristine.A bummer since it was not mentioned in the ad and I had purchased a case and screen protector for it. I always protect the phone before it goes outside.It’s an expensive device so why people don’t protect it from day one I’ll never know, I guess some don’t care. I have a spare screen protector now.Battery Condition  Battery Health says 91% Maximum Capacity relative to when it was new, 86% charge on startup.Even though capacity says 91%, I am not having issues where I am out of juice early. Over a day with moderate use, heavier use I would need to recharge around 06:00pm-07:00 pm. This of course is a YMMV.Setting it upPhone was already reset. You set it up just like if it came straight out of the factory.CameraNo scratches on the lens and photos come out crisp and sharp.SpeakersNo issues, sound is very good. No hissing, cracks or pops.Microphone, Lighting PortNo issues. Works.Phone came with iOS 12.3.1 installed. So far I have not come across any issues that would give me pause on the purchase. Phone is working as expected and the ad says phone is like new and I would have to agree. Amazon tends to lump all the reviews together, regardless of seller so you can’t tell which negative review belongs to who. It’s as if it was all sold by one seller.Reviewers need to say who their seller was.My seller was MobileDealz and at the time they were a little bit cheaper than most.  This phone debut at 849.00 + tax on September 22, 2017.

Great price! Phone works. A little wear. Works with Ting!,"The phone came as described in awesome packaging (as in, not just a cardboard box). The phone works great, it's fast compared to my iPhone SE, and was nearly flawless cosmetically. It had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs, but that was covered up by the case I purchased. Besides, cosmetics don't affect the performance of the phone.Something I was a little leery about was the description, so here's my experience: The phone I received was unlocked and works great with Ting. The description said unlocked, but some reviewers mentioned that they received a GSM phone, and I was looking for CDMA. I received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network. I purchased from BuySPRY. I hope they don't mind I mentioned them.It is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked. However, if the description specifies a specific network like ""unlocked GSM,"" then the phone will only work on GSM networks.

"Better Than New, It's USED (A Good ""used"" Product)","""Refreshed"" is the new term for ""pre-owned,"" or ""refurbished,"" and if you don't need bragging rights for owning the latest and greatest high-tech device, this model of iPhone 8 might just fit the bill. Compared to the whopping prices demanded for the latest versions of the iPhone, while these are not cheap, they are certainly much more affordable, and these iPhones can perform the majority of the fancy stunts of the latest iPhones with a few differences, including having to make do with 4LTE, rather than 5G network speeds when it becomes widespread.The two iphone 8's we purchased arrived in good condition, one with a few minor screen scratches that we can live with, otherwise both intact and usable in every way, including with batteries that charged in the 90 percentile ""health"" status. The phones are unlocked and the two we received will work with both SIM cards on GSM, or on (non-SIM card) CDMA networks. We used the SIM cards from our old phones using the ""Speed-Talk"" (T-Mobile) network; these SIM cards came from cellular plans we bought from Speed-Talk on Amazon, and once the SIM cards were inserted, the phones worked perfectly.As of April 2021, the iPhone 8 supports the latest iOS operating system updates, and hopefully will remain on Apple's ""security update"" list for a number of years to come.Our experience with the two iPhone 8's, (used in conjunction with a late model Apple iPad), has us agreeing that Apple has created an excellent interlocking system for personal communications, which explains the popularity of the iPhone and its cousin, the iPad.It is worth mentioning that the function of ""iCloud,"" (Apple's server farms) which serves as a continuous (free for five gigabytes of space) backup system for your ""i""-devices; also works as a means to share notes, photos, email, calendars, and contact lists and can be accessed online using a web browser from any computer, no matter what the operating system. Appointments and contact information can also be added or modified while accessing the ""iCloud"" account from a web browser, adding a great deal of functionality to the iOS communications system. Absent from web browser access is the iOS ""Message"" presence, apparently because Apple does not want this popular message application being used or accessed on anything but ""i""-devices.The iPhone 8's were simply but sturdily packaged with a ""lightning"" charging cable and a standard USB to 110 AC adapter enclosed. Also, a tiny ""SIM card holder"" release tool was in the box, with a short prong about the diameter of a paper clip that will release the SIM card holder so you can insert your own micro SIM card into side of the iPhone. There was a walk-through brochure enclosed of how to charge and power up the iPhone, but if you are new to the methods of using one of these devices, you might want to visit YouTube where there are lots of videos about using iPhones. We had never owned ""smart-phones"" before, but we picked up the skill set easily without too much trouble or much of a learning curve. (Going through the multiple settings and options takes some time and thought, but that can be done at your leisure).With cellular networks turning off 3G and earlier network connection configurations, the iPhones were a good choice, with iOS ""message"" and ""Facetime"" options, as well as our use of a VOIP system that works through both the iPhone cellular and wireless network, allowing us to save on cellular minutes by using WiFi for sending and receiving phone calls.The ""refreshed"" iphones work well and we find they are quite handy, though we have, to date, refrained from the habit we see everywhere of people quickly pulling out their smart-phone at every opportunity and waving it around in front of their face. If we ever reach that point of insane phone-mania, we'll have to go back to using a taut string with two tin cans for our communications.",2021年4月14日 在美国审核
Reviews scared me... but was pleased with my purchase.,"I read the reviews AFTER I purchased and instantly got nervous. My daughter had her phone stolen from her so I was somewhat in a rush to replace it for her, and a refurbished iPhone 8 for under $200 seemed like a pretty good gig. First, I got the phone 2 days sooner than expected which was nice because I was able to set it up and make sure all was well before she was even expecting it. When first looking at the phone, it was in great condition. The charger we were provided wasn’t manufactured by apple but it definitely does the job. My fear was going to be that the phone wasn’t truly “unlocked” as some reviews state. But it was a relief when the phone company told me there was no problem at all and quickly set it up for me. Her phone was up and running almost as soon as it arrived on our doorstep (after stopping by the store for a new SIM card which wasn’t provided. No problem for us though, it only ran us about $10.) overall I’m thankful we purchased this phone because it saved me a lot of money and works just fine for my daughter!

"The ""Renewed Premium"" iPhone 8 is a great buy!","When the charging port on my old iPhone SE (first generation) went bad, I needed a replacement. But what? Any new phone from Apple costs a small fortune. Yet buying a used or ""renewed"" phone from third-party suppliers is always a gamble.So with considerable trepidation, I searched Amazon for ""renewed"" options. I knew that third-party sellers' ""renewed"" phones came with an Amazon-backed 90-day guarantee. But then I discovered Amazon's ""Renewed Premium"" products. That's where hired techies put the product through rigorous restoration and (in the case of the iPhones) 20-point testing, after which Amazon offers a full year's guarantee, for any reason. That generous guarantee, and the fact that Amazon would ship the product directly, reassured me: I decided to buy only a phone covered by that ""Renewed Premium"" warranty.In choosing, I wanted a step up from the first-generation SE and the dated iPhone 7. I also wanted one whose battery could be recharged via a wireless charger, rather than those plug-in ports, which can wear out (it's happened to me twice).I settled on the iPhone 8 -- the silver model, 64 gb, fully unlocked for all carriers, and of course with the Renewed Premium guarantee. Its product page promised me ""a like-new experience."" I figured that was probably a bit of an exaggeration -- that any used/renewed phone must have SOME deficiency, if only minor cosmetic damage or a less-than-100% battery.Well, I'm thrilled to report that by ""like new,"" Amazon delivered me a renewed iPhone 8 that looks and functions as if it had just come fresh off Apple's manufacturing assembly line. I mean a gorgeous, pristine-looking phone with ZERO defects, scratches, or cosmetic blemishes on its screen, edges, or back. After swapping the SIM card from my old iPhone SE, the iPhone 8 powered right up, and -- as far as I can tell after several days of use -- it functions perfectly in every respect. Furthermore, even though Amazon only promises that the phone battery will charge to at least 90%, mine charges fully, to 100%. In short, it's a phone indistinguishable from a brand-new one -- but at a far-more-affordable price of just a few bucks over $300.Let me add that the phone wasn't casually swathed in bubble wrap and dumped into a cardboard shipping box, either. Instead, it came packaged in a sturdy ""Amazon Renewed"" box -- one that was custom-designed to hold that model iPhone, its charging cable, its wall plug, and a SIM tray opening tool. Each item was individually wrapped in plastic and fit inside its own designated slot in the box. This extra care in secure, well-designed packaging was much more than I expected.I've experienced many good transactions for a lot of great products on Amazon. However, this iPhone 8 purchase may be my best experience yet. (Okay, except perhaps for the purchase of my own thriller novels, published via Kindle Direct Publishing -- but hey, I'm biased). I eagerly recommend this particular model of the excellent iPhone 8, purchased under the ""Renewed Premium"" option. With that guarantee, there's absolutely no downside risk, and I think you can confidently expect to enjoy a truly ""like-new"" phone.--Robert Bidinotto, author,The Dylan Hunter Thrillers Series",2020年8月21日 在美国审核
"Looks, feels and functions like a new iPhone!",I needed to replace my old iPhone 5S because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera.The iPhone 8 was priced right and I'm very happy with it.The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.,2018年10月29日 在美国审核
Renewed Premium is the way to go,"Upon opening the box there is a packet of information with ""Open me first"" on it.If you do that the set up is flawless.Once you turn on your new/used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings, address book and apps in a matter of minutes, it could not have been any easier. You then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it's ready to use. On the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least 90% or better, to my surprise it's at 100%.The iphone itself looks like it's a new phone, not a scratch on it, it even has a month or so left on the original Apple warranty from whoever owned it before.I've been wringing it out, texting, taking pics, making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone 6 plus didn't have and so far so good.While I liked the bigger screen on the 6 plus I could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me.I don't know if all renewed premium phones are like the one I got but I'm really impressed, better yet I have a full year to put it through it's paces.I wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank.My hats off to Amazon and the tech., MM in New Jersey that tested and signed off on the 20 point inspection certificate, nice job on an outstanding phone.",2021年3月5日 在美国审核

It could only hold a charge for a few hours so I had to have it replaced at the Apple store.Within just a few minutes of me leaving my original feedbackthe company that sold it to me (Hybrid IT) called me directly and offered to pay for the battery replacement (which they did).Just simply wow! In less than 10 minutes they called me and made it right.If you want one of these phones I highly recommend you choose the vendor Hybrid IT for it.,2021年1月8日 在美国审核

Works,"I needed an older iPhone as my $2K+ Samsung Z Fold2smart phone is not compatible yet with the Dexcom medical app that I will be using soon. I plan to use this iPhone 8 specifically for that app's functions only - no phone/text/email services needed. The only requirements are that the iPhone can connect to WiFi (no sim cards/carriers needed), can be upgraded to the latest iOS software (it can) and that I can download the app itself (which it can also), and it has Bluetooth (to connect with the device sensor (it does). So, everything is good to go for my personal use of this iPhone until my Samsung Z Fold2 is added to the device's compatibility list.",2022年5月21日 在美国审核
Hesitated based on reviews - but VERY happy,"There are several people on here that wrote reviews saying the phone didn't work on Verizon, broke shortly after, etc.It certainly made me pause before purchasing, but I really needed a replacement phone for my son and wasn't going to pay top dollar for a new phone again.I ordered the phone on a Tuesday, and was surprised when the FedEx box showed up on Thursday (a full 4 days earlier than estimated).Next, the packaging was decent and included a genuine charger plug and cable.Finally, the phone looked absolutely brand new.Not a touch or smudge anywhere.I immediately took it to the Verizon store, and they got it registered on the network within 5 minutes.I know there are other reviews that had similar experiences as mine, but you always think that you are going to be the one that gets the dud that doesn't work.It would seem like it's a good company though and perhaps they'd swap it out if you happen to be unlucky (I can imagine it has to occasionally happen - it is a used phone after all, each with a different history).Apparently I got one from a grandma that didn't take it out of the box. :)Overall, very happy.Hopefully you will be just as fortunate.And if not, I'd feel safe about working with them company to make it right.",2020年10月20日 在美国审核
Great renewed phone - but make sure to check the vendor b4 buying.,"Not sure if people aware that when we buy a renewed phone at Amazon, it is sold by different vendors depending on the version, size, color you choose. It is VERY important to check who is actually selling the phone &amp; ensure that they have a good rating. My black iPhone 8 (64gb) was purchased from HybridIT which has a 99% positive rating. A shout out to HybridIT. The phone was cosmetically flawless &amp; 100% functional. The battery health is at 88% which is very good considering the age. I’m 100% satisfy.

Outstanding value!,"I wanted to change to a new carrier that did not support my current phone. The carrier supports less than 20 phones and the iPhone 8 is one of them. After looking at all the phones that would work I started narrowing them down by cost and power. This phone at 256gb of internal memory for less than $300 was by far the best value. After reading the reviews I was a little concerned about appearance and battery life but that is definitely not a problem. The phone that arrived looked brand new, not a mark on it. I do not use a phone heavily, a little bit of internet surfing, a few calls and a few texts. Before setting the phone up I left it turned on in standby mode for 48-hours and it still had most of the battery life left. When the new SIM card arrived I gave the phone and full charge and started the setup. After setting up the phone, icloud, carrier, synching to old phone, downloading new apps I wanted and leaving phone on for 36-hours there was still over 60% battery life left. That is more battery life than I am likely to ever need. The only drawback I have found so far is the camera. When using indoors, photos have a yellow look and are just terrible. The camera does seem to do a really good job on outdoors shots. This is the first iPhone I have had so it may be the camera in the renewed phone is just subpar and not indicative of all iPhones.Pros:memory, touchscreen sensitivity, fingerprint sensor, included applications, screen visibility, appearance, ease of use, wireless charging compatible and price.Cons:camera is awful, my $50 Alcatel took better indoor photos.Overall: Camera notwithstanding, I would recommend this phone to anyone. A coworker just bought the same phone new, with half the memory and paid $200 more than Amazon's renewed price.",2020年2月18日 在美国审核
Exactly as advertised.,"The Iphone 8 was in prefect condition with not a scratch to be found anywhere.It had the exact memory as advertised.I could not be happier with it.T-Mobile on the other hand was terrible.The first store told me that the phone was not compatible and that I should go get another one.Even though it displayed T-Mobile when it was turned on it wasn't compatible?Really?The next store took a really long time to add a SIM card and the customer service support for the stores is as bad as the ones we get when we call.One guy ""accidentally"" hung up on us after half an hour after it was clear that he didn't know what he was doing.The next person got the phone going but assigned the SIM to my existing phone.Now we had two phones that didn't work.The next rep couldn't believe that we didn't do this on purpose but was able to get them both going.So the phone is great T-Mobile is not.",2022年1月2日 在美国审核
Excellent Phone - The extra storage is very helpful!!!,"Dislikes:1. Because this was a refurbished unit, the battery life is not that of a new phone.2. The Wi-Fi hotspot loses connectivity - at times it is better to is the Bluetooth connection, which eats more data.3. I came from android, so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing. This makes the ""Home Screen"", which is the only place you can put widgets, useless. I want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone. Apple offers very limited widgets. Most apps do not have one.4. There is a glitch in the iPhone 8 that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times.Likes:1. Not requiring anti-virus is nice.2. Siri is worlds better than Google Assist. (waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options, like ""Siri, read me the content of website xyz"", etc.). Siri is the main reason I switched from android. It is awesome!!!",2020年11月4日 在美国审核

Great Refurbished iPhone 8 from TRADEMORE.,"Purchased two rose gold iPhone 8’s from the company TRADEMORE. The phones arrived in two days and in great condition.

Small but not out of date.,"I've never owned a iPhone before, so i decided to go the refurbished route due to this, and I'm significantly impressed. this tiny guy was a hassle to get used to screen size wise initially but after a week or so, it was easy.Also being refurbished there were a few things to note.1. This unit originally was a SPRINT CDMA model, with a Qualcomm radio inside.2. It was fully unlocked however. Works with both Mint Mobile and Verizon3. If it matters, benchmarking speed tests oddly made this unit max out at 200mbps no matter how many times i tried.and 4. battery capacity for me was 96%, and this unit holds about 5 hours of charge with low power mode enabled. 96% battery with 230 charge cycles.Translation.. a 1821mAh battery, with a 720p screen, grants you 5 hours of screen on time, somehow.. Just don't play games with this, it'll kill the battery quickly.5. probably not that important, but the display, camera and touch ID sensor were all replaced which probably meant whomever had this device originally probably shattered the screen.So all in all its hard to get used to. I'm so used to needing a 4000mAh battery in my old phone to give me the same all day battery life, yet this one with under 2000mah gives me 1.5days of battery life easy.oh and i would go and buy the apple smart battery accessory as well. it increases your battery capacity to 4100mAh total, and this phone usually lasts about 4 days on a single charge. its nuts. Would buy again.",2020年5月2日 在美国审核
A rocky start -- but then just fine,"I purchased this iPhone 8 (with the Renewed Premium Guarantee) for my daughter.It arrived in excellent condition.However, the first day she had it, the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about 40%.This happened again over the next couple days.I went into the battery settings (see attached screen shot) and found that the battery was seriously degraded, even though it was supposed to be in ""similar to new"" condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least 90%.So I called Amazon Customer Support for a replacement phone.It was a cumbersome process.The Amazon representative had to contact Apple, and he and I were on hold with Apple for about 20 minutes.When the Apple representative got on the line, the Amazon rep left the call.The Apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing.She then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out-of-warranty pricing to me for a new battery.I objected, stating that Amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why I had to pay for anything at this point.She then had to talk with her manager, and again I was on hold for several minutes.She came back and said that I would have to talk with Amazon about the phone.So I took the case number she gave and called Amazon back.I was on hold again for a few minutes with Amazon, but when the customer service rep came on the line, I explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately.I received the new phone the next day.It arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly.Everyone I talked to, both at Amazon and at Apple, was very nice and easy to deal with, it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem.All told, I was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced.I am satisfied with the replacement, I just wish the process would have taken less time.",2020年9月16日 在美国审核

"Arrived in good condition, but maybe change the packaging.","At first I thought I got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box, which sounds fine at first, but the box had the details of a completely different phone so I was sweating a bit when I saw that. The phone was correct, though, and came in good condition. It wasn't perfect, as you'd expect from a refurbished phone; there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner, but that doesn't bother me one bit since it's covered by my case. I think that $280 is a good price for a well-refurbished iPhone 8, since it also comes with the trust that it's in top renewed condition versus buying for less from FB marketplace or something like that. I also purchased the protection plan which covers drops, cracks, water damage, etc. and it is well worth it to me. After the initial $50 payment, paying $29 to have my phone repaired or $49 to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me.",2020年2月6日 在美国审核
I could have never told you this wasn't a brand new phone,"I actually accidentally ordered this product when I meant to only add it to a wish list. I contacted the seller and they agreed to work with me to return it, but I decided to actually keep it, but kudos to the seller for being great! The phone was in perfect condition. It came on a recent but not the newest version of iOS so I had to update it before using it. No dents or scratches anywhere, battery health was at 100% when I checked it too. It does not come in original packaging or with Apple cables to charge it or to connect 3,5mm audio cables. It does come with a MFi (Made for iPhone) ac power brick and lightning connector cable and a sim eject tool to help you change sim cards.I just want to share some insight about GSM vs CDMA models. This is a GSM model phone, however I am a Verizon customer-- which is a CDMA network. GSM model iPhones have all the LTE bands that Verizon uses (I think Verizon's mainLTE band is 13 or 14 if you want to look up compatibilityyourself). So even with a Verizon sim card in this GSM only phone, I can still access all of Verizons 4g networks and have phone and text service, as well as LTE and voice over LTE. If I ever go out in the middle of nowhere I won't be able to make calls likely because I won't have access to Verizon's CDMA bands, but it's just as good as any CDMA model for most peoples uses, just don't expect to have cell service while camping or in some state/ national parks if you are a Verizon customer. 4g and LTE is rolled out very wide so you shouldn't have any issues.",2019年7月5日 在美国审核

Can't tell it from a new one!,"Even though I purchased a renewed phone, I can't tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality.I didn't rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because I haven't (and probably won't) use those features.The battery life is sufficient for my activities, so it gets a 5-star rating.I don't play games or watch videos on it so far (since I'm an old geezer, lol!), but I do have a few, favorite apps I access from time to time.If you're not really tech savvy (like me) and can't figure out how to close the apps, just google the question and you'll find the answer.Closing the apps saves the battery, naturally.(I read where some were complaining about the battery life and, if they're not closing the apps, this may be the culprit.)<br>I had an old Android before and would never go back since purchasing an iPhone.I've read the iPhone is much more intuitive to use.Now, I have demonstrated such to myself.The camera is quite an improvement over the one in my Android.(The Android couldn't flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing.)I've taken some really beautiful, true-to-color (imo) photos with the iPhone 8--comparable to my expensive (for me) Canon Rebel AND I don't have to change lenses for closeups, lol!Phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically, too.I'm still learning all the features of the phone (not just the camera) and will get more proficient over time.I really, really, love my ""new"" phone and wouldn't hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again.This is the first time I've purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used/renewed phone, especially over the internet.I had absolutely no problem activating it (cell provider even gave me a free SIM card) and no malfunctions for the two weeks (now) that I've been using the phone.The only thing I would recommend to some reviewers/buyers (who say their phone won't charge) is the plug will fit into the phone either way.I found out it will only charge one way, however.So, I marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since.(The plug in my old phone would only fit one way, so I couldn't screw up, lol!)Also, there's a way to put the battery indicator (life percent and charging indicator) on the front of your phone (at the upper right corner).Just google how to do this, too.Easy-peazy!That way, you always know if the phone is charging (by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol) and the percentage of charge.(I think my old Android had this feature on the front as a default.I had to direct the iPhone to do this.That's not a complaint.There may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this, either, if they want it on their front screen.)</br>",2020年10月12日 在美国审核

Being this was a different sell I figured I would give it a shot. And the only complaint I have was the color wasn’t what I was expecting it almost looks like rose gold. Like pink essentially. But I’ve grown to like it. And it would disconnect from my phone carrier sometimes and say no service. But it hasn’t done that in a while so I’m extremely happy to say I think for the condition, GB size and battery life. This was a good purchase. The phone performs very well in various aspects. Camera takes good pictures, visual quality of the screen is great for watching videos or playing games, and the battery life can last an entire 9 hour shift at work with battery to spare.

Probably worth it regardless of battery capacity,The seller got the phone here very quickly. It was packed as indicated and included charger that seems to work well.

These Renewed phones are guaranteed to come with batteries that have at least 80% capacity left. Mine came in at 81%. So technically its acceptable but unfortunately I will be spending another $50 soon for a new battery because it does not last under a day of light/moderate use.

Great Condition and Easy to Set Up,"I've been an iPhone user for the past 13 years, and while I love the interface and design, I do not like paying the high price for a new phone. Last month, after dropping my iPhone 6 (I know I'm very behind on the models, but it still worked well!), I made the decision to upgrade. I love that I can use Amazon Renewed to find a iPhone at a fraction of the price of a new one.Many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems. Since the seller Hybrid IT had great reviews, I felt better about taking the risk. (To be noted, I initially bought a iPhone 6S from Hybrid IT, but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iPhone 8. The return was easy and the seller was helpful!)The phone I received was in great condition, and I had no trouble setting it up with my AT&amp;T SIM card. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and I haven't run into any issues.There are a few things to add, the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug-in. It did not come with headphones, so if you are buying an iPhone 8, you'll have to buy Bluetooth headphones or Earpods with the lightning connector, which are about $29 on the Apple site. Finally, the battery health is at 84% according to my phone, which is expected with a refurbished phone. It does last me through the day, but something to note if you are in the market. I hope this helps!",2020年6月10日 在美国审核

The Best Purchase I could have Made...Hands Down,"I thank the seller because I was skeptical about the purchase and debated for a bit before taking the leap and purchasing. I am so glad that I did. I can understand why the seller is listed as the Best and are ranked as #1. Just like others who purchased this phone, I expected it to have issues and not be worth the purchase. However, I received the phone 5 days earlier than noted. It also arrived literally looking brand new and it works as if I had just purchased a brand new Iphone. Let's just say I am overly excited that I got such a deal and an amazing purchase. I am ready to buy all kinds of cases and accessories for my new phone! Yay!",2021年2月12日 在美国审核
Really great service,"A nice IPhone with really good features and affordable. The only problem it’s some scratches on the phone and the battery health because it’s not a brand new phone, in my case I don’t have a lot of scratches but I have 84% of battery health. The seller that provide me with gifts, a case and a ceramic screen protector.I love this IPhone, it’s similar at the one I had before and have more storage than before for a lot less money. If you want a great iPhone or you are new to this, you can buy an iPhone SE 2020.But if you know what’s best for you, I highly recommend this one",2020年10月28日 在美国审核
Almost can't believe it's a refurbished phone,"I used to be an apple fanatic and then I switched to Google Pixel. Recently had a bad experience with a refurbished Google Pixel 2 phone because I failed to read the buyers reviews (always read them folks especially when buying refurbished phones) and I decided to go back to Apple because, why not.I didn't want any of the latest models because honestly I don't care for them so I was looking for an iPhone 8 in good quality and with significant storage. I came across this one and I was able to find a 64GB gold iPhone 8 through Verizon pre-owned. Honestly, highly recommend buying from Verizon pre-owned because not only did it accept my Cricket Wireless SD card effortlessly BUT, the phone is literally intact. It basically looks brand new. No scratches, not even on the corners. Clean screen and back of the phone. The fingerprinting works perfectly. All of its features work as if it was a brand new phone! Plus battery life so far has been doing incredibly well. So if you're thinking about switching over but are skeptical, try looking at Verizon pre-owned and their reviews and purchase!Looking forward to continuing taking bomb selfies with this phone.",2020年4月8日 在美国审核
Risk and reward,"I was very concerned about the hit or miss reviews from a used iPhone by others but I’m glad that I decided to take the risk. The iPhone arrived in timely manner in a non-Apple box with charger and cable, no ear bud. I have many Apple chargers and ear buds etc so I did not need them. I only needed the phone and it was in great condition. Glad to be able to reuse a product that still has a lot of remaining useful life.",2020年1月5日 在美国审核
"What I like - this is ""like new"" as promised","When I bought this used/refurbished phone, I was just happy to get an ""upgrade"" from my ancient IPhone 6; what I needed was something secondhand, affordable and still usable.I was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new—even pristine, as promised by seller.In terms of functionality, the sensors and controls feel as though I've bought a new phone. All 256gb was available. The speakers, microphone and display work very well.When I was switching out the sim card from my old IPhone 6, the IPhone 8 started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer, without my activating the migration function - very cool. The transfer was so near perfect that the IPhone 8 migrated all my WhatsApp messages, which I was expecting to lose (because I don't use icloud). The migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms, I needed to type in the initial passwords again (even though they were transferred to and saved on the IPhone 8) - just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time.By the way, I am a Singapore buyer, and this order was routed through an Oregon transshipment facility, before it was shipped to Singapore.What's the takeaway I can offer in this review? Buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw: there is a chance you may get a dud. In this order, I am happy to say that I got exactly what the seller promised. So here's my 5-star thumbs up!",2020年7月5日 在美国审核

IPhone 8 looked and worked like a brand new phone,I picked up the phone to replace my wife’s iPhone 6. Prior to buying an iPhone 8 through this method I read through a bunch of reviews. I admit that I was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device. I took the chance and bought it. The device was in really good shape. These phones are all glass. There wasn’t a scratch on the thing. It is pristine. My own 8plus has been in cases the entire time I’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the 8 I purchased here. There are zero signs of wear on the lightning port . Battery was at 90% health. I updated it to iOS 13 (it had 12) The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new.I can safely recommend this product and seller.,2020年4月24日 在美国审核
Worked for me and as advertised 👍🏾,I read many other bad reviews but mostly because of the seller they got them from I heard the phones not being unlocked or in a certain case 1 blacklisted and some just down right complained about features they didn’t include such as headphones (which was in the description not included) mines came in this generic normal box and had like 2 very small scratches very unnoticeable til I looked hard while I cleaned my finger prints off the phone but I tested the for carrier lock or black list and the phone was in great condition unlocked as advertised 92% battery this phone almost looked brand new just be cautious of your sellers because when u chose a phone different options of sellers provide your choice as well but other than that I rate ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ felt like I got a great deal for a great price very satisfied,2020年2月5日 在美国审核

Exactly as described at an excellent price,"Shipping was super fast, arriving a day early. The phone was in good condition, as described. There is an area of scratches on the screen, but it’s in the top right and not on the actual touchscreen area; with a screen protector they’re not even viable. Everything works perfectly so far, and battery life is superior to my previous phone’s battery that was only about a year old.I was absolutely thrilled to find they included a screen protector in the box. I don’t remember seeing that mentioned in what was included, but it absolutely made my day since it meant I didn’t have to run out to get one or order one and wait for it to arrive.

Worth buying refurbished,"I bought this iPhone in March of 2020. I had always been an iPhone user before, but decided to try a google pixel… I hated the android phone. I didn’t want to break the bank on a brand new phone which at the time was the iPhone 11. I purchased the 8 because it was very reasonably priced, and I just wanted an iPhone again badly. I didn’t know what to expect from a refurbished phone, but I’m very impressed. The phone works just like you were to buy it at a retail store. Camera, fingerprint, apps, phone, and texting all work the way they should. My only complaint would have to be the battery life, but I kinda expected it to be somewhat lower than what the standards are today so I just charge it on my lunch break and I’m good for the rest of the day.

AMAZING! I recommend it...,"I am a 12 year old girl, and I payed my own money for this phone. It came in the mail on the last day that it said it would, so kind of on time.

The fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty, but that is the only time. I put in my left thumb, right thumb, left pointer, and right pointer into the thing and all of them work 99% of the time. The battery life is good, but I leave it on dark mode, True Tone off, and I always like to keep the brightness down. The phone adapts to the brightness of your surroundings, and so if you’re in a dark room, it goes dark and vice versa.

It's a yup from me 👍👍👍,"I gotta be honest I didn't expect to get a damn near perfect iPhone 8.It was sim locked to AT&amp;T but less than 15 minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone I was able to insert my sim card then use it on the CricketWireless service.There is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn't a problem because a case would cover it up easily. Other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else, battery is great, no Cloud lock and everything functions normally.I don't know if I got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 90 day warranty is a plus.Thank you for blessing me with a phone I could give to my mom cuz she loves having TouchID and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too (even though she's never going to use it).",2020年3月1日 在美国审核
"Risk Paid Off -- Take the Plunge, People--Also, Buy a Protective Case","I almost never write reviews--I think it's worth doing so here.Many of them here scared me.But, given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold, I took the plunge and bought the product.I waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here.It arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left-hand corner that I really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place.Within 48 hours, I made a larger blemish to the poor R2D2 when I dropped it screen-side-down on my hard floors in my apartmentLuckily, the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn't affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party,I guess, so the disaster mostly was avoided.This experience made me come to terms with the fact that it's only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode.Pro Tip: I highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don't end up like me.The iPhone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator, who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision.In all seriousness, I am thrilled with this purchaseApple designed them to be slippery.See that you buy a screen protector.",2020年6月1日 在美国审核

I have two boys that both have the iPhone 8 Plus and it’s consistent with their Battery Health. I put my daughter’s Verizon SIM card in the renewed iPhone 8 and haven’t had any issues.

"Arrived on time, very satisfied","As expected, the battery was not at 100% capacity but it was higher than expected at 89%.There’s practically no scratches on the back or front of the phone and everything seems to be in excellent working order.I did not expect a charger or screen protector to come with the purchase but it did! The screen protector was already in place so I didn’t have to use the one I bought and I will be saving the charger the phone arrived with in case I need it later.This was listed as a FULLY UNLOCKED iPhone and I believe it has arrived as such, it will definitely work for the carrier I initially intended, which is Cricket.I believe my little sister has a step up from this phone (the 8 Plus) and she’s still paying for her phone through the provider. I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before this so I’m glad it worked out, if anything happens within the next 90 days before the Amazon warranty expires I’ll be sure to update. Definitely would buy the protection plan in addition to the phone, as accidents do happen.",2020年2月19日 在美国审核

Great service,"I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.",2018年10月15日 在美国审核

"As advertised, except for the model number!","I specifically sought this US-based model number A1863: it is listed as such.Awesome.I instead received a Japanese version model A1902 (apple p/n MQ782J/A).Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.That is why I am taking off one star from this review.To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.I've had it for several weeks, with no hiccups.AppleCare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as 88%, but this is obviously a used phone.Still a good value for me.",2020年7月4日 在美国审核

COMPANY LIED IN THEIR ADVERTISING - PHONE WAS NOT FOR VERIZON AS ADVERTISED!!,"(I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 &amp; A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore Ireporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON",2020年6月4日 在美国审核

You’ll like it,"This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll😍. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped its 💯 percent honest.Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.",2019年10月5日 在美国审核

Excellent phone at a reasonable price.,"I bought this phone to replace a cheap Galaxy J3V which ran out of storage space after a few videos (16 gig vs 256 gig).I saw the Iphone had a different size SIM than the Galaxy so I ordered a new SIM from Verizon at no cost and got it one day after I got the phone.I charged the Iphone for several hours and started the activation.Wouldn't activate and I talked to 4 or 5 Verizon people over two days (and long waits for a tech).The last guy said he could see the phone and the SIM on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone, so I sent it back and said I would try another (the people at KISS were nice and got me a different phone).Both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed.Guess what?Still wouldn't activate.After over an hour wait on Dec 26, the Verizon tech said I needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal.This immediately made sense to me (why didn't the other Verizon techs figure this out?)After a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower, the phone activated in about 15 seconds.Amazing, right?Not exactly.I got back home and couldn't do anything over wifi.The next morning I got to speak to a techright away but no solution.The next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem.Guess what, I had to go back to the tower to get a strong LTE signal to activate wifi.The phone works fine now and I'm very happy with it.KISS gets good marks and Verizon needs to know some people don't have cell service at their home.",2021年1月2日 在美国审核

Careful of the IMEI,"A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&amp;T and T Mobile are compatible.<br>I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network.

Almost as good as a new one....,"I was impressed with the phone.The battery lifespan on the phone when I got it says 90%.Not bad at all!No scratches, no dents, looked pretty much new.Saved hundreds and now I have the phone I wanted with 256gb to download anything under the sun which is why I replaced my old phone that only had 18gb.My work would only allow us to get the 18gb iPhone which really annoyed me but I understood why.So I took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone &amp; just pay for it myself.We use AT&amp;T as a provider at my work, so all I needed to do was take out the SIM card from my old iPhone and put it in this 256gb beast....I’m so happy I did.So far so good.I recommend this seller for sure. Great product! I will update this review down the line if I end up having any problems out of the ordinary.Hope this review helps as I was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase.Also, I purchased using my Amazon credit card which allows you to make 12 monthly payments around $30/month at 0% interest.I can’t lose!!!That’s the cost of 10 coffees at Starbucks a month.I’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs.Okay, I’m done.Now I just sound like a bag of hot air.",2019年8月30日 在美国审核

Good...the second time around.,"UPDATE:After I returned the first iPhone, I ordered a second one.The second one came very quickly as well.This one came with 81% battery capacity and much less pitting and wear than the 1st one.Since these are used phones, I guess it really just depends on the luck of the draw.I did notice the price increased a few dollars when I purchased the second one, so maybe there's something there? Anyways, adjusted my review from 2 to 4 stars.The second phone deserves 5 stars, but since I had to go through the process of returning the 1st one, which forced me to switch phones 2 weeks later than I would've liked, I say 4 stars is fair.ORIGINAL:To note: I am obviously returning this product, but will give time for the seller to make things right.I will change/delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation.To the seller's credit, this phone was delivered much faster than expected, almost a week early.However, what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn't as advertised.One of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed 80%.That's directly from the description from the listing.Imagine my disappointment when I go to settings and see the message ""Your battery's health is significantly degraded..."" ""Maximum Capacity: 76%"".This is worse than the iPhone 8 I currently have and was trying to ""upgrade"", and keep in mind I had my current iPhone 8 for about 4 years now.Completely unacceptable.If even after all that, you still decide to purchase one of these, I should also mention, if you look close enough, you can tell you bought a used phone.This isn't to knock the seller or the product, it's clear you're not getting a new product, just shows minor signs of wear and tear.",2021年3月14日 在美国审核

Renewed? Yes but almost perfect.,"I ordered this iphone specifically becauseits advertised as renewed. The condition of the iphone i received was, to the untrained eye, half renewed. Upon inspection, i saw the top left of the display where the mute switch is located, to be slightly lifted. I thought the worse, a bad, swollen battery. When i would press into the screen it looked as if something was pushing it up. Confused and worried, i went ahead and turned the display to full brightness to see if the batterywould drain too fast, surprised to watch netflix on full brightness i got 3 hours untill i hit 5% battery, so i shut off the phone, and proceeded to take apart the screen. What i found was astonishing. Firstly the battery was healthy and slim looking. Second, i tried putting the screen back on correctly but i couldnt snap one side in without the other getting caught on the inner frame. Upon further inspection the screws on the side that hold the display were extremelyloose and preventing the clipson the side to go in and snap into place. I tightened them up on both sides and lined up the screen top side first, and it snapped into place perfectlyflat. I am disappointed the phone didnt come as advertised in the pictures in accordance to claiming the phones being renewed. Summary, yes its an actual iphone, yes its fully functional, yes it looked new, no scratches, however, its obvious the phone screen was taken apart to either replace it, or replace the home button, or whatever reason to make it look new. But attention to detail was skipped with the loose screws that hold the lcd panel, and no new screen adhesive was applied to seal the phone and keep it looking actually renewed. Im lucky i alreadyhad a smartphone repair toolkit from home depot, to continue my phone ""renew"" procedures, any other customer who doesn't have the toolkit, or is afraid they might ruin their purchase, would probably give a not so constructive criticism review, but rather an upset, anger induced review. All in all im happy with the device and the quickness of the seller to ship the phone with fedex, from Maryland all the way to my place in california.",2020年5月3日 在美国审核

I took this picture for Amazon member elchamber.  27 November 2020,"I do not want to be negative about this iPhone 8.When received it looked like ""new"" condition.I was pleased with that.Day 1: Generic charger (included) did not work.Even I was ok with that.I had another from an iPhone.It worked fine so that is how I know the included charger ws defective.I was impressed with the packaging.It was so nice &amp; neat.I charged battery to 90% and, WOW, could not believe rapid it discharged (about 3 hours).I figured I had too many apps running in the background.That didn't solve the issue.Few features I set my preferences did not retain.After powered off and then on, my preferences were not saved.I do feel the phone is a value for the price and it does what it is intended to...Make &amp; receive calls.Bluetooth signal is great.I was trying to be ""thrifty"" but will just purchase a new iPhone (w/Apple Care coverage) and pay it in 24 months.I will be returning this phone.Again, for a younger, maybe school aged child it is a great phone.The Messaging/Text is fine and I was able to receive a small photo attachment.If I had a child, this would be the phone they get (from me) before I would buy them a $700 + phone!So my review is 3 stars and my main concern is the BATTERY LIFE.",2020年11月9日 在美国审核

It's an okay phone but..,"It's my first iPhone, always been into galaxy. I was pretty disappointed with some features overtime, makes me wonder how Apple is so rich with these bad decisions they've done for their phones. Android is way superior. I upgraded to the galaxy S21 Ultra and it's amazing. The iPhone was okay for the time being, but it only got worse at the last month I had it, i think my iPhone 8 was defective cause over half the time no one could hear me speak on the phone, sometimes better or worse on speaker, I'm so glad I'm done with this. I'm giving it a 3 out of kindness cause I had some good times with it mainly with music. But even then, putting music on an iPhone is stupid too. They're still stuck in 2008 relying on an app to transfer music (itunes) while Android is the future. Also couldn't edit videos on Sony Vegas cause that app doesn't support their stupid .mov files, so converting is necessary and I didn't wanna bother, so glad this phone isn't necessary no more, but if I had to say anything good about it, it's okay for the buck and if you like iPhones.",2021年3月15日 在美国审核

Within 2 days, I had the 2nd phone in hand and it was in pristine condition BUT it would not read her SIM card. I took the phone to AT&amp;T thinking it was a SIM card issue. However, it was a device issue. So while in AT&amp;T, I just chose a brand new phone to save myself the hassle of trying to get a working ""renewed"" one through Amazon.

Didn't work out of the box.  2nd one is working.,"I bought this phone to replace my old iPhone 6s, because the battery wasn't keeping a charge all day, any longer.When I got it home, I thought that my wife (who also has a 6s), might want to try it out first, since hers was having the same issue, but after thinking about it for a few days, she told me to try it out first.Well, first I had to find a YouTube video to figure out how to change the SIM card, since I hadn't done it in many years.Then, after carefully replacing the SIM card, I go to turn on the new/used phone, and -- nothing.I had charged it beforehand, so I knew the battery wasn't dead, but the Home button didn't work!The return process is pretty simple; but it's just a drag to get something new/used, only to have to send it back and get it replaced.I'll update this review after the replacement arrives.10/03/21 update: The replacement arrived a week ago and voila' -- this one works -- so far, so good!It seems the Home button on the iPhone 8 has a different ""feel"" than the iPhone 6s, which has a more positive ""click"" to it.Battery life is OK, but doesn't seem to be quite as good as a brand, new phone. Everything else seems to work OK, so my wife wanted to upgrade her 6s to one of these, since her battery wasn't lasting either.We just got hers &amp; transferred the SIMM card, so we'll see how that one does.",2021年9月20日 在美国审核

Barely Functioned,"I should have known better- as soon as I tried to turn the phone on to set it up, there were problems. The phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home/power buttons.<br>I finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence (I was mistaken) and began to set up the phone. The phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night. Again, I blamed it the amount of data I was transferring from my old phone. (mistaken again)I used the phone for a few days, and it reset or shut down probably an average of 5 times a day. Sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons, touching, or even my attempts to force it to shut down. I would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again.I ended up returning the phone, and asked to exchange it for one that worked. The company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead. Now I am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one. I will not be buying this phone ever again and I recommend that you don't either.</br>",2018年12月12日 在美国审核

I don't think Kanga Supply does a very in-depth quality assurance,"By reading some other reviews and based on my own experience I feel as though Kanga Supply, probably doesn't do a very intensive quality assurance on their products. If I could guess, they get a lot of refurbished used phones, which for the majority of the time work fine, but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty. The phone I received wouldn't even turn on, despite trying to charge it with 3 different chargers. I guess it's my fault for not looking at their website, where they make no guarantees that their products work. If you need a phone immediately, I wouldn't suggest buying from here, unless your willing to wait 3-4 business days for an exchange or refund.",2018年11月8日 在美国审核

The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes. Now a single exceptionally loud click sends every critter in the vicinity scurrying for cover.",2019年10月23日 在美国审核

It came with an iPhone plugin charger &amp; cable. The phone was charged when it arrived. I used the sim pin from my 5s to move my SIM card from the 5s to the 8.

No disappointments with the product or service,"My iPhone was scheduled to be delivered the day after the long Labor Day weekend, but it actually arrived the Friday before, which was an unexpected surprise. There were no scratches at all on the body or screen of the phone, it looked to be in virtually perfect cosmetic shape. Once I got it running from my iCloud backup everything seemed to work exactly as expected, and now a week later still is functioning perfectly.The camera takes excellent photos, the screen is slightly better than my iPhone 7 it replaced, and wireless charging seems to work perfectly- no excess heat, not overly slow. My only possible complaint with the phone is that it came in with a slightly lower battery health percentage than I was hoping for- 89%. I was hoping I'd get something in the low to mid 90's still for battery health, but I get a full day with moderate to heavy use so can't really complain about that.All in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the phone or BuySpry",2019年9月7日 在美国审核

Was leery to buy a used phone for the 1st time but totally worth it,"I bought a used iphone 8 and it was amazon certified. I opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. I have had it about a month now and I havent had any issues at all with the phone's performance. Battery lasts a long time, no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi/no wifi.I was so leery about getting a used phone. I've always gone new. When I saw it was only $200, it's worth a shot vs spending $800 on a new phone again. They gave me a 90 day return policy as well for the piece of mind. So far, this was the best bang-for-buck deal rather than buying a new phone. As long as I dont have any issues in the near future, I will continue to buy used phones from Amazon that are certified.",2020年4月6日 在美国审核

Battery health was 79% after opening it and using it for 2 weeks...did we check that status before...no.The seller says it should always be above 80% and will gladly refund, return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if I visit an authorized Apple store.I chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery.Seller not only reimbursed the total amount, it was actually more that the receipt I sent, maybe for my time and effort?In any case, totally happy with the purchase, completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller.Phone looked perfect and still acts 100%, like-new, 3 months later.",2021年3月10日 在美国审核

The phone looks like it’s brand new. It works very great. It is unlocked and was easy just to pop in my sim from my iPhone 6s into this iPhone 8. I upgraded from the 6s to the 8 because I have had the 6s for 5 years now and never gotten it cracked or broken or anything and it works fine but in the last couple of weeks to a month now it seems like the 6s battery isn’t lasting as long after a charge so instead of finding a place to try to get it replace for god knows how much I figured it was time to upgrade my phone and now I’m glad I did.,2020年5月2日 在美国审核

Good value for money,"This iPhone 8 was great value for money. I do not use it as my primary cell phone, but as a house phone. The quality is great. The battery life is only 82%, so just over the 80% mark. This is not too much of an issue for me, as the phone stays on the wireless charger all the time. There is also a screen placed over the front of the phone, which is great, but as a result, the home button is not flush with the rest of the iPhone, with feels a little wired and takes some getting used to. Otherwise, good value for the money.",2022年2月17日 在美国审核

Beware of refurbished iPhones - Disappointed,"The good:1. The phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before Christmas.2. It looked perfect, no physical defects.The bad &amp; the ugly:1. I discovered the phone came from Japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off, by law. Took it to the Apple Store, and said they couldn't do anything about it. I take a lot of photos, and the loud click is a pain. But, that was a minor detail for the price.2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again...

Phone wouldn't charge during these moments so there was literally nothing i can do. And sometimes when the phone would do this is would go right back to its normal charge and work as normal until the sequence started back up. This was extremely annoying when i would be busy on my phone. One morning i woke up and the phone would not power on at all, even when tried charging with multiple chargers. I sent it to apple thinking this was a simple battery problem and i could pay a cheap $49 for a replacement but later got a message saying that the phone was completely defected an the problem was far beyond just the need of a battery replacement.

I should've expected what I got,"I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway.

Slightly defective,"Whenever my phone breaks, I usually buy a replacement from someone on craigslist - I thought this would be a safer bet. Unfortunately seems not to be the case.

Good so far!,"For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.",2019年7月11日 在美国审核

Used and refurbished iphone 8,"I got the 64Gb iphone 8 used and refurbished. It's unlocked, and my (att) sim card had no issues with the phone. All iphone 8's should have the capacity to take the various sim cards, so I wasn't too worried. The battery capacity is at 88%, which the seller advertised would be above 80% so they are true on their word. The phone looks good, it's clearly used, and the charger cable may not be genuine apple and the plug is definitely not an apple product. That's all in their description as well and I don't mind that at all.Overall I'm very please with the phone. It has only been a week, so it may be too early to tell. I will update if the satisfaction changes since some reviews report phones going dead within 3 months. Honestly if this phone holds, for 270, it's a great deal and I'll definitely buy again.Update: the previous review stays, however I am sending the phone back and deducting a star because I do not believe it was unlocked.

Defective. Not worth paying $380.,Received a defective phone:1. The boot screen would display a line either above or below the Apple logo occasionally.

I compared it to a friends iPhone 8 and the problem was specific to the phone I received3. The touch screen would not respond occasionally4. The battery would not display correct percentages. I once had the phone charging for 20 minutes and the percentage did not increase at all. After restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage.This also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone5.

Good Phone,"I upgraded from an Iphone 6s to an Iphone 8. I had been looking around and saw this refurbished one on Amazon for $248 and decided to take a chance on it. I also had $40 of credits to use. I figured it's backed by Amazon with their 90 day warranty too. I don't play games or watch movies or any of those things so I didn't need to get the newest Iphone that's out there. My old one had 16GB this one has 64, so I'm getting 3 times what I had. I like the smaller size too which is another reason why I got the 8. They do ship it in a generic box with a generic charger.The charger lasted 4 days and broke, good thing my old charger works on it. I've only had it for a week but so far, so good.

Hit or Miss,"11/21/2019I bought this phone in August, arrived in original packaging with an Apple charger- worked great with no problems! Like new, camera worked great, absolutely no issues. However, my phone got stolen from me at the end of October. So I ordered a second one- complete opposite experience. Came in a small, dirty box with some weird charger. Had obvious scratches on the screen, and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality. I had been waiting for 3 weeks to replace my phone so I gave it a shot anyway... the microphone did not work at all. When people called, I could hear them and they couldn't hear me- which I had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from AAA, who hung up on me upon my ""lack"" of response when I answered the phone. Took it to T Mobile and chatted online with Apple to do some troubleshooting- turns out it's just a bad refurbished phone, so the only answer was to return it. Disappointed overall- good luck with your order...12/2/2019Increasing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Still leaving off one star for the 1 busted up phone, and 1 star for the inconvenience and 3 weeks of waiting to replace my phone- as well as both times the shipping delayed, (however only by 1 day each time, but I think I should mention it since it is listed ""Prime FREE Delivery""). I ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone. THANK GOODNESS IT PAID OFF. I got another phone, quality as good as the first one. I leave this review after 1.5 weeks of phone 3 with no issues. I will update my review if anything changes but currently I am relieved it worked out.",2019年11月21日 在美国审核

A good renewed phone but not perfect.,"This renewed iPhone 8 arrived in good condition, there were no visible scratches and overrall the phone works great!<br>However, the battery does not hold up to the &gt;80% capacity claim, after a few days of first activating it, the battery declined from 80% to 77%, although the charge still lasts quite a bit. Also, this specific unit seemed to have had the screen replaced at some point in the past, considering the brightness and pixel density is definitely NOT what is expected of an iPhone. The phone works internationally and is not locked to any specific carrier. However I would've still loved for the seller to be more honest with the battery capacity claim.If you don't have the budget for a new iPhone but still want the Apple experience, I'd recommend you to go ahead and purchase one of these renewed ones.

My Phone Experience,I would like to say I bought this phone and It worked great at first. I used it for 3 days then I plugged It into the charger like normal I come back and it won't turn on. Keep in mind I did not do anything drastic to this phone before. Then after a while It randomly turns on then works for 2 minutes and shuts off. I am currently trying to get it fixed. I would recommend saving up for a new phone.,2021年5月2日 在美国审核

The listing stated battery health guarantees at least 80% and that is exactly what my phone indicated. So, I will have to get a new battery installed immediately to make my “new” phone useable. So, now I’m over $300 after the $60 battery replacement cost.

10 month owner,"Overall, I've been very pleased with this refurbed phone. It was delivered in like new condition and until recently has acted like new. Recently, the phone's charging receptacle stopped working without finagling the connector. I have tried 3 different Apple branded charging wires and chargers and it's the same with all 3. I have to insert and re-insert the Lightning wire several times, hold it just right, carefully place it at an angle and set a weight on the phone by the connector. Only then will it charge. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty and I'm sure it will be too expensive to fix. So I guess when I can no longer find the sweet spot to charge it, I'll look for another refurbished iPhone.On a side note, for my daughter, I bought an identical refurbished phone at the same time (different vendor, but I don't think that matters here), and it's working perfectly.",2020年12月19日 在美国审核
Terrific phone after a second delivery!,"The phone I have now works so well, it's in seemingly perfect condition! For what I paid for a used phone, I feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day. I wish I could give four stars. There were several communication issues/ product issues that I felt took this order in a wonky direction. 1.) The order was sent to my address with signature required. When I asked to remove the required signature (I'm not home all the time), the package was sent the next day to a location one state away. Rather than spend another four to five days without a phone, I chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the FedEx facility. Okay.2.) The first phone stopped working after a few weeks. Believe me, being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue (I don't even have a phone at home, what if I had to call 911? My employer? Etc.) They gave me a VERY quick and flexible response, saying they would replace or return the phone. Amazing response! They told me to remove my iCloud info and delete the email app, which was impossible because it wouldn't even turn on, but no problem, they removed the iCloud account and email when I turned it in somehow. However, they did not mention that I would have to hold onto the SIM card!So they sent me a new iPhone, nice model, everything fine, except- no SIM card. 3.) No SIM card. By this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis, my carrier was closed except for in one location (fine) but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service (not fine - no phone.) After all the drama I figured out how to call them without activation on my own. A few days later I got the SIM. Anyway, the NEW phone works outstandingly, the exchange was smooth, they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees. However the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery, the first phone battery stopping completely, and the lack of communication about holding my old SIM card backed up my phone use. I'm all set now though. Four stars.",2020年4月16日 在美国审核

The rep also asked for my passcode, and when I explained what happened, he checked the number and said it was not an AT&amp;T number. He took my IMEI and ICCID numbers and was able to unlock my phone so I could call out without going automatically to that number.

Disappoi,For almost $200 iPhone 8 regular I thought was not too bad of a price I mean honestly I think it’s still high. But we needed a phone so I bought one for myself and one for my husband. Mine you’d have to have the charger adapter for to the phone set a certain way just so that it would stay charging. Half the time the charge would be down with his a few minutes. Not having. But there were no scratches no dents came in great condition. And like I do a lot of telemedicine and my doctors either couldn’t see me at the time or couldn’t hear me so that’s gonna go into a trade-in program or donated to veterans,2022年1月25日 在美国审核
Ok at first but ended up being bad buy,"Phone was “renewed” but arrived looking brand new and with 100% battery capacity. Sadly, it has not turned out to be a good buy. Shortly after the return window closed, the phone began having audio and messenger issues. I am now only able to talk in short intervals of 1-5 minutes before the outgoing voice capability drops. I can still hear the person on my phone but they cannot hear me. A quick redial and all is ok again but only for a short time. First few times it happened, I could shutdown phone, power up and the problem would disappear for a few days. Not so any longer. Comes back as quickly as first call after power up. Haven’t been able to discern a pattern for length of call. Seems to randomly go out. Sometimes it will last 5 minutes, sometimes 45 seconds. iMessage also randomly converts to SMS. Quick restart seems to correct that issue but phone doesn’t seem to recover iMessage function without restart once it drops. Everything else seems to (at least right now) work as it should. Tired of dealing with it so I am back in the market for a new iPhone.",2021年6月17日 在美国审核

"It’s used, you get what you pay for!","I bought the silver iPhone 8 used here through Amazon, and everything works great on the phone. I haven’t had any issues using my carrier, sound playing, or otherwise. Works as intended which is the important part.However, the back screen was clearly replaced and done so with little care. There’s alip on one side, so the glass back isn’t flush as it should be. Not pivotal to the function of the phone itself, but still annoying.EDIT: After a month or so of owning the phone, it starting having issues. Ultimately I sent the phone back to the seller and received a refund. Still 4/5 for easy return without issue.",2019年8月21日 在美国审核

It does not work on all carriers!,"I gave this phone a 1 only because the seller is not describing it properly.It is a gsm phone and, as such, does not work on Verizon or Sprint the same way a Verizon or Sprint phone will work.Those carriers use CDMA phones, so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage.It worked in as far as I could get it activated to make calls, receive texts and be fully functional, but only in certain areas.I had an iPhone6 &amp; an iPhone 4 before that, both with Verizon &amp; both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend's house &amp; never once lost service in 6 years.Then I bought this phone &amp; had service fine until I got to his house &amp; then my phone said ""no service"".It did this repeatedly for a few days every time I went to his house &amp; stayed that way the whole time I was there even though my boyfriend's Verizon iPhone 8 worked in the same house at the same time &amp; never lost service.I called Verizon &amp; they said this phone was a T-Mobile phone &amp; is a gsm phone &amp; explained that if I want the same level of coverage I had before I need an unlocked phone that was originally a Verizon phone so that it is a CDMA phone.I guess an original Sprint phone would work, too, since those are CDMA phones.I told Amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or CDMA.",2020年2月8日 在美国审核

Water damaged and corrosion inside.,"When I got the phone, I was disappointed, but not surprised by the 85% capacity battery inside. I expected I’d be taking it in to Apple for a battery replacement, anyway. But, when I took it to Apple, they couldn’t replace the battery. They showed me pictures, where there was standing water and corrosion inside. Needless to say, I was shocked. Not only did I have the phone in a waterproof case, I only had it for a few days, and NEVER had it near water. I immediately contacted Amazon, who contacted the seller. The seller asked if I’d submerged the phone. I couldn’t believe it. After a few days of emailing, they agreed to a refund. I asked for a different phone with a full capacity battery as compensation. I use the phone for work. I missed out on money. They said they couldn’t oblige that. But, they did refund me promptly after reviewing the water damaged phone.",2019年8月29日 在美国审核

Honest opinion,"Hi guys, I got the phone, it was unlocked as advertised, no problem for my carrier and I am in Europe. The phone works good for me, I've had it for a couple of days, although the battery capacity is at 89%, it can hold up to 2, 2 and a half days with talking and surfing, no charging. It doesn't restart, as some comments here say, which was what I was worried about and really the value for money is great. Apart from a couple of dinges on the side, visually the phone was great, it even had a protector on. For the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at 100%, just go change it, it's like 20 bucks and don't forget this is not a brand new phone, so for a refurbished phone that I got I can say I am pleased.",2019年7月23日 在美国审核

PHONE'S IMEI NUMBER BLACKLISTED AS LOST/STOLEN,"The phone initially worked just fine and I was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier. A few hours later, however, I realized I wasn't getting authentication text messages while trying to set up social media apps. While trying to make a test phone call, I was redirected to my carrier's customer service line. The representative informed me that the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number had been blacklisted as lost/stolen and that I would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either Apple or Verizon (the former carrier). This is unacceptable considering I paid for a fully unlocked phone. On top of that, the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly.

Also buttons like mine will lose there tack-tile feed back and become more mushy and hard to detect if you pressed it or not. Last but not least the SIM card tray was handled with less then desired care as mine did come bent where you enter your sim tool into... all these problems can be fixed with off the shelf parts, but might cost you more the.

After contacting T-Mobile it was revealed the there is a carrier block on the phone and it cannot be used because the previous owner never paid the phone off. Just be aware this could happen and verify that the phone is clear and unlocked.,2020年1月20日 在美国审核

"Be careful of this ""certified and tested"" Amazon qualified supplier!","The camera sound (the “click” when you take a picture) cannot be muted, not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the Silent Mode. I went to the Apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired, but they said no: they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from Japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced. I found it extremely disappointing, as I would have never bought it if I knew in advance – and I am very surprised that this is an Amazon “certified and inspected product”: did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted? At least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off.As a loyal customer of Amazon (Prime too) from several years now, I found it extremely shady: you sponsor a product as certified and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications, given that Amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world. I am based in the USA and knowing that the product would have come from Japan and the camera cannot be silenced, I wouldn’t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier.This is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by Amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process.Lastly, the battery is weak – it lowers down very quickly and I have to charge it at least three times a day.",2020年3月1日 在美国审核

Then after a day of using the device I stumbled upon a problem that was inconvenient, the app store wasn't downloading apps.

I read the negative reviews about the battery life not lasting and thought that was just part of owning refurbished. But wow, this is RIDICULOUS. Do not buy from this seller.<br>The iPhone 8 generation itself seems like a good buy if you want something newer (I did, because I had an iPhone 6 so I needed an upgrade). I've always bought refurbished and factory reset, because I've always been thrifty and as a now stay-at-home mom of two I need to be thrifty on a budget. I also need a reliable phone when I'm home alone with both kids or out driving and god forbid need to make an emergency call. Anyways- to the point- saving money was not worth this piece of garbage. It worked great for about six months. I bought the phone at the end of March- it's now mid October and the phone will not work unless it's plugged directly into the charger. If I take said phone off the charger- even at 100%- within minutes the phone dies. So now I don't have a phone and cannot afford to replace it, because in my house $300 is a lot of money. I would just advise carefully researching and do not choose this seller.</br>",2021年10月12日 在美国审核

Unexpected strong disappointment with “renewed” IPhone 8.,"I purchased this renewed iphone8 in December 2020 for my wife to replace a very old previous one. It’s operation has been far less than consistent owing to increasing occurrence of dropped calls, inability to reach attempted calls, and generally declining performance. I purchased this phone on the basis of having a great experience with buying a renewed iPhone 8 Plus from Amazon.Anyway, we’ve had this phone since December 2020 knowing it is technically past a warranty/return, but nevertheless, given my very long and strong status as an Amazon customer, I’m hopeful some form of remedy may be possible for this failing phone.",2021年5月15日 在美国审核

Performance Yes Appearance Iffy,"I have a love hate relationship with Apple. I will not buy a new product from them ever. Why? They brick phones with updates. That's shady. They smile while they do it too. So? Well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones. Prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn't affect my choice of where my cash goes. What does have some weight in my decision making is customer service. I pay the asking price I get a device as advertised. Simple enough right? You would be surprised or maybe you wouldn't. The local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don't seem to get what good customer service is. So.... okay. Get to the point right? I got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and I didn't have to deal with anyone so that's a plus. However, the appearance of the item was ummm .... acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector. The peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and I'm sure feeling slightly used.Have I mentioned it prior to this post? Nope. It really wouldn't matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn't as expected. Customer Service guys. Don't just don't. Will I buy another when the time comes?

"Saying ""renewed"" might a be a stretch",Got the phone yesterday. Seems to work fine (I haven't tested all features yet but it powers on fine). The speaker and charger ports are all filled with dirt. The screen looks pretty good but the back glass got a lost of scuffs/marks. The biggest issue is that this listing claims that it is Unlocked and works on ALL carriers including Verizon but the model that I got only works on GSM networks such at AT&amp;T and T-Mobil not on Verizon or Sprint. Most people don't know but there are TWO versions of iPhone 8 Unlocked: A1863 which works on all carriers GSM and CDMA and A1905 which only works on GSM carriers. The amazon should be clear about which model is being sold so not to waste customer's time!!!,2020年3月5日 在美国审核

No biggie, I just need it to perform basic actions and not die. Here's where the second issue comes in to play. Upon receiving the phone the battery was already at 70% integrity. After the 90-day warranty that integrity was below 50, and now my phone has turned off and refuses to charge. I still have my old phone so this isn't too much of an issue, however now I'm out 240+ dollars and an iPhone.I realize beggars can't be choosers, but you're honestly much better off getting a refurbished phone from a store.</br>",2020年6月11日 在美国审核

Great for a little while,"Worked for about a month then the screen went black with vertical lines. I understand they can’t find all the bugs when refurbishing these phones. My problem is that we couldn’t send it in for repair or exchange, we had to send it back to Amazon then wait for a refund and then try to find another one at the same price. The whole process is longer than if we sent it in to get the screen replaced. When a company says they have a warranty I expect them to fix the problem or replace the item, not make me take an item back to the store for a refund.We did buy the extra accident coverage here on Amazon. We used it the last time my son bought a phone and it was an easy process: file a claim online, answer a couple questions sent by email, return the phone and get an Amazon credit the day ups scans the label. I was afraid my son wouldn’t get his money back since they prorate canceled plans, which makes sense. Thankfully Amazon sent them a message and they were kind enough to refund the whole amount so my son won’t be out any money when he orders a new phone and plan. He mowed lawns to save up for this phone so this is a big bummer for him, although it’s a good lesson in patients.",2022年6月29日 在美国审核

I wasted a few hours setting up the phone and return process isn't the super smooth qr code drop off .You must hunt down a printer (who has one of those these days!) and affix the label yourself.Maybe avoid unless you have a gambler's personality like me with too much time on your hands? There is a non-zero chance the exchange I get will also have a problem if they aren't even checking if you can make a call and hear the person on the other end.

However, the replacement was a Iphone 8 ""plus"". When I called to ask why they sent the plus-sized phone, they told me that the regular size was out of stock...and therefore they gave me a $90 dollar discount to just keep the wrong sized replacement. I was okay with this, but within a day found out that the microphone on the replacement was dead and I had to yell for anyone to hear me when making calls. I called the ""premium renewed"" amazon support staff and was told that they had no replacement to offer me as the plus size phone was also out of stock.

Upon closer examination I saw what appeared to be a small crack or deep scratch on the screen so I removed the screen protector and verified there was a small crack along with multiple scratches. The lightening connector port was also dirty and had scratches. Ultimately, I did not feel it met the standard of being renewed and not worth the money spent.I am in the process of returning the iPhone 8 and will find another vendor.",2019年11月23日 在美国审核

The speaker to hear anything is so quiet I highly regret buying this phone ):,I didn’t leave my house for the 2 years bc Covid and bought this iPhone bc I was about to be leaving again and needed a phone. This was a huge mistake. I didn’t start using the phone till about a month ago so I didn’t notice that the speaker sucks. When I get phone calls or call out it’s so freaking quiet even on what should be loud speaker phone. The battery life is absolutely amazing but the speaker to hear doesn’t work so this phone is useless to me. I am older and don’t need much phone use but to call when i really need to but this phone does not fulfill that job. Super duper sad bc the return window is closed which is stupid. If you are going to buy this phone don’t just assume that since everything else works that the speaker will be loud. Oh also the bottom of the touch screen doesn’t work so I have to use the talk to text bc the space bar doesn’t work and the bottom row of letters. I do not recommend!!<br>Updated: the phone no longer charges.</br>,2022年3月22日 在美国审核

I was told I would have to Return the item and Buy a new IPhone to replace this Defective unit. This is where it gets crappy. I submitted the online return thru Amazon and labeled the item as Defective with description and printed of the shipping label, only to find out that the shipping label requires the Purchaser to PAY return shipping, even though the product is defective. I called Amazon Renewed number because they 'guarantee' 100% customer satisfaction, and I was told that I will need to go out and pay for return shipping, call Amazon back with the amount, and then will have to mail-in the receipt to be reimbursed.

"NO Manual, NO Sim card, NO Customer Service","These phones require a special sim card - something you won't know unless you spend three days online with your service provider troubleshooting the phone. I paid $5 at one Boost store. Wrong sim card. Bought another one at a full Boost dealer and the card was $15, but required another $26 to activate/change my plan. Oh, but it didn't end there. The Boost agent didn't enter my address, phone number or email address - all things my internet security relies on. It's been a week now and I'm STILL trying to get Apple to release my password on this phone so I can get into my Internet accounts - which are MY BUSINESS. I have two-factor authentication activated and THAT relies on a PHONE that is properly working. No idea how much it's cost me in lost time, customers, and money.Customer service is poor to nonexistent as they believe once they sell you the phone it's up to you to figure out how to activate, what SIM card (5G) to buy and so on. They do NOT include a manual, or even a one page QuickStart facts about your phone. Cost to them? PENNIES to print out the simple facts you need to get started.It's a nightmare.

Apparent faulty facial proximity sensor from the first use.,"Poor refurbishment; it appears that the proximity sensor was faulty despite the phone being approved by 'quality control'.All kind of interesting things were occurring on my newly refurbished iPhone 8 from the first phone call to all subsequent phone conversations.The screen was staying active and illuminated when I was speaking with someone and I found myself often explaining to others that I hang-up on them, muted them, sent them a random pic, etc... with my face.The phone was returned and my money was returned as well.I understand that it happens occasionally but it was a waste of time that was a gift to my mother for xmas.Another was purchased from a different refurbished and it works just like you'd expect an iPhone 8 to perform.",2021年2月21日 在美国审核
Phone died after 4 months exactly.,"Phone died after 4 months exactly. Went to an Apple store as well as to an independent lab. Both said battery change won't help and nothing can be done.

We have to follow the policies and procedures under the Amazon renewed program in order to be able to sell on this platform. Amazon will not even allow you to send the device back because it is out of warranty and we have no control over this nor can we circumvent the system.""So either the seller did not renew the phone properly, or it's amazon's fault and their ""Amazon renewed"" program is bad.

Disappointment (you get what you pay for),"In the end, this was a headache. At first it seemed to be okay, but when I went to check battery health, it was below the 80% that they committed to. I asked for a replacement battery, and I had to keep reminding them until it finally came after 1 month. But it was worthless; they sent a battery that did not keep charge for very long. So finally, since I had already had all my software installed etc., I just bought a new battery ($50 added to the price).Had that been the only thing I would have been OK. But a few weeks ago, after just 6 months of use, the WiFi stopped working. So now I'm buying an altogether different unit. In other words, I was penny wise and dollar stupid.A much better deal seems to be buying not the ""renewed"" but rather the ""renewed premium"", which comes with a 1-year warranty and an battery guaranteed to be at 90% or more.

I can't work without it. When the last day arrived, I mailed the phone back, but they already canceled my replacement because I didn't send the phone back right away, and they assumed I was trying to scam them. They should have told me they weren't going to send my replacement until they got the other one back. That's not what they led me to believe. I contacted them and asked when I would get my phone and they said that all they can do is wait until they get the phone to refund me.

Battery was a dud making the phone unusable and a non-responsive seller.,"I will admit that I did not open the box and use the phone until 94 days after purchase. My wife got during Christmas time as it was a good price and gave it to me for Vday. That said, it had battery issues right from the get go. Unfortunately, it was past the 90 day window for the Amazon warranty. I reached out to the reseller but heard nothing back. Long story short, the phone is unusable unless I take it to the Apple store and get a new battery. It goes from 98% to 54% in a matter of 3 minutes. Battery health from settings says your battery health is significantly degraded and to replace it. This should not happen 95 days after purchase and honestly in my case 1 day after actually beginning to use it. Stay away from this reseller.",2022年2月25日 在美国审核

I called and explained the situation to these guys, and they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough. Since we were out of warranty, they just said ""nope, no exceptions."" I understand that technically they don't have to work with us to solve the problem, but seriously, in this day and age, great companies who care about customer service will be reasonable and help find a solution. I'm even willing to pay a little for them to swap out phones, but they were completely dismissive and rude to me on the phone and 100% unwilling to help. I'd recommend taking your chances buying a phone with another company. If you ever run into any problem, these guys clearly have zero interest in doing the right thing.

Never again will I purchase a phone like this. Better off dealing directly with Apple or Verizon.

BE CAREFUL - phone died within 3 months .. logic board toast,I expect the phone to last at least a year... it started to die on day 89 (Mon).. and died completely on day 92 (Thur). so missed any window to have this serviced by BuySPRY (90 days). Took it to Apple who diagnosed a complete logic board failure. Apple would have at least been sympathetic to the 90/92 days... not so with BuySPRY. So now I have an expensive brick.,2019年11月18日 在美国审核
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY,"In April, I was excited when my iPhone 8 came in only to have it end within a matter of a few short months.The only good thing I can say is the camera was amazing, at least while it lasted.For some unknown reason, the LCD blew up inside the phone. Unfortunately, even though it shows a 1-year warranty sticker on the phone you only get 90 days. I'm literally 5 days past and neither eCommsell nor Amazon can or will help.So, if you are looking for garbage, shop here all you like but if you need a phone that will last DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company.At this point, after many, many years, I'm not even sure if I will shop on amazon either.",2020年7月27日 在美国审核

This phone might not work after 90 day warranty is up,"My son saved up all of his money to buy his first phone. We decided on this Iphone 8 that was refurbished by an amazon authorized retailer. The phone came with a 90 day warranty. It was supposed to have a battery with 80% life or higher. The phone arrived with 81% battery. That should have been a red flag. Either way my son was excited and the phone worked. Eventually the phone STOPPED WORKING and I reached out to the seller for some assistance and they told me that since it was 97 days after the purchase there was nothing they could do. I could under stand if it was 6 months after the purchase but it was still only a few days out of warranty. So..... if you buy this phone dont expect any help after 90 days, even if its 91 days they will make you feel like you got robbed.

I was told it would turn on with good battery %.Didn’t even do that.I am very disappointed and I feel like I got scammed.

Not a good working phone.,After purchasing this as a spare (I travel frequently) 11 months ago I finally found myself in a situation where I needed it. After unboxing it all seemed well... Until I went to use it. The service is absolutely horrible and it constantly dropps calls and shows 1 bar of service where my previous IPhone 8 that I purchased from apple worked perfectly. Clearly the refurbishment was not done correctly. I suppose part of this is my fault for not testing it as soon as I received it. Guess I am just out 500 bucks at this point.

Sketchy quality refurbished devices,"Got the phone in July, but was not able to begin using it until August due to the carrier failing to unlock the device before sending it out to us.

We eventually took it in to an apple authorized repair specialist and they informed us that it seemed like the logic board just died.Reached out to CellCow and they refused to do anything as it was outside of the 90 day amazon guarantee window. Waste of $360~ or so for what is essentially now a paperweight.Overall I wouldn't suggest doing business with this company unless you're willing to risk devices breaking JUST outside of the warranty window and dealing with poorly handled device unlocking.",2021年12月6日 在美国审核

I never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways.I strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable, at least for me.

Missing information makes purchasing this item a total gamble.,"Despite all being called 'iPhone 8' there are actually several models of iPhone 8 that exist. These are specific for either the GSM or CDMA networks, which are two different types of cellular technologies used by the major carriers (Sprint, AT&amp;T, Verizon, ect). CDMA compatible phones do not work on GSM networks and vice versa. So it's a misnomer to say that any phone which is exclusively GSM or CDMA is ""Fully Unlocked""- because it will literally be incompatible on a hardware level with about have of the carriers. I was sent the A1905 model of the iPhone 8 (at the time of purchase there was no indication of what model was being sold- just ""Fully Unlocked"") and this particular model is incompatible with the Sprint network.
