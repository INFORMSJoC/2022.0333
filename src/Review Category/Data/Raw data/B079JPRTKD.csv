Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far,"I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus.UPDATE: 4/7/2018.The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer.2nd UPDATE: I didn'trealize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&amp;T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&amp;T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&amp;T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&amp;T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&amp;T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&amp;T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&amp;T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options.3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely.4th UPDATE April 23, 2018As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.",2018年4月1日 在美国审核

best phone of 2018,"this is the best (and most beautiful) phone of 2018, hands down.Pixel 3 xl has a worse processor, less RAM, worse battery, no equalizer, no DeX, no hdmi output, no SD slot, the stupid notch, and is $200 more expensive.iPhone Xs Max has similar performance, no fingerprint sensor, worse battery life, no SD slot, the stupid notch, no DeX, and is $400-600 more expensive.Note 9 is too big for one-handed use, too big for most pockets, has the same processor as this phone, but is $300 more expensive (tho if u use the sPen, that's the best phone for u).seriously, i waited for all the flagship announcements, only to find out that the s9+, announced 6 months ago, is still the best phone of the year, and it's not even close.completely customizable, and just a pleasure to use. the new Samsung software is much better than the old bulk in the days of S3 or even Note3.

Unlocked is the way to go,"I read all the reviews and decided to go with the Amazon shipped version of this phone to have the Amazon guarantee.A lot of reviews said this phone would not work on Verizon, and that voicemail and wireless calling was not going to work.Well, all of these comments were obviously from people who didn't investigate it thoroughly.My wireless calling works fine, my voicemail works fine and the phone works on Verizon.Here is what I discovered that you will need to do if you purchase this phone if you putting it on Verizon.Be sure to register an account with Samsung Galaxy store right on the phone and update all of your apps and when you do, it will give you Samsung Essentials and visual voicemail that is just like Verizon's only with a Blue Icon instead of Red.Works the same.If you go into the settings, and turn on wireless calling, it might take a couple of tries, but it does come on, and it does work as I live in a completely shielded home where Verizon's signal does not penetrate my walls or roof and my phone works perfectly over wireless.As far as getting connected to Verizon goes, all you have to do is take your SIM card from your old phone and put it in the new phone.If you have to get a new SIM card from Verizon because of size difference, have Verizon register a new SIM to your old phone, then you put it into the new phone.These phones are approved on Verizon's list of phones, but their system does not recognize the IMEI number and says it is not compatible and won't let the stores customer service reps scan the phone into their system.You have to put your old SIM into the new phone and then it works perfectly.I called 611 while I was in the store and they told me how to get around their system not recognizing the IMEI numbers as valid.The unlocked S9+ is the best phone I have ever had..... totally happy with my purchase.",2019年3月1日 在美国审核
"Great phone, good battery life, cheaper than buying directly from Verizon.","My S7 Edge LCD screen just died last month so I needed a phone right away. I am currently with Verizon, so it sort of limits my phone choices. This phone works with Verizon, it was cheaper than buying it directly from Verizon, and I didn't have to pay an activation fee since I used my old sim card.In all honesty, I like the looks of the S7 Edge better than this S9. I also miss having a physical button at the bottom of the phone.Passive battery life on the S9 has been amazing so far. My old phone would be almost completely drained by the end of the day if I just checked it every once in a while. With the S9, I was periodically checking my phone once in a while, sending texts, etc., and I still had over 50% by midnight. Some apps do kill the battery life pretty quickly, but the phone will notify you every once in a while when it notices you have apps running in the background.Have not had time to play around with Bixby yet.",2018年9月4日 在美国审核
Works Perfectly With Verizon,"I finally got tired of fighting my old, slow (from Verizon) Galaxy S5 and tried this unlocked S9+ from Amazon...was a little apprehensive about it actually working with Verizon from all of the different stories on the internet about folks buying an ""unlocked"" phone and having trouble with it. This S9+ arrived in brand new condition. Charged it up and then set it up, which was easy as the phone leads you through setup. You can do this without a SIM card. After setup, I contacted Verizon via online chat - the support person could have set it up (activated) right there with no problem, but the SIM from my old S5 was physically bigger than the micro slot for the S9. So, I had to go to a Verizon store - took about 5 minutes to get a new SIM, have them activate the new phone and test it. Easy and hassle-free...thankfully. Going from an S5 to an S9 is like going from a go-cart to a BMW. Things that used to take minutes and drain my s5 battery (you could actually watch the battery percentage go down by 10-15% just trying to get directions) now literally take a couple of seconds.

I asked support to change ""device"" to Galaxy S9, but it never went through.The camera itself has beautiful playback of all forms of media and has a great battery life.

The cameras, while nowhere near the level of the Google Pixel 3, are still very strong on their own, producing quality photos, steady video, and surprisingly good portrait mode. Only downsides are that the battery drains a little faster expected, a dedicated Bixby button which can be really annoying if you press on accident, Samsung bloatware, and a very tacky AR Emoji.

An Amazing Fast Dependable Phone!!!!!,"I always had Samsung phones over the years then about a year or so ago I thought why not try a different manufacturer. It worked great at first then in time, it would freeze up and I couldn't do anything with it. Then it ran extremely slow, again nothing worked to fix it. I even did a search online and found out the manufacturer admitted these problems and gave step by step directions to ""hopefully"" fix it. But...it only worked for a day or so that was it. Then about a month or two ago, it started just shutting off. no matter what I did, it would not turn back on, it even had a full battery. Sometimes it would take four or more hours before I would just try it again and it would turn on. Once this started being a regular problem it left me no choice but to get another phone. With my cell phone history, the smartest thing to do was to go back to the one manufacturer that NEVER gave me a problem, Samsung!! It's not the latest model but it has more bells and whistles any of my phones ever had!! I always had to download apps for different things like night vision camera, this phone has it as well as a number of other special lens type filters. The camera on this phone take the most beautiful photos I've ever seen from a cell phone before. The photos are vibrant and bold. There are at least 12 different settings to try. The display, has a blue light filter for eye strain, a night mode also.It also has edge panels which I love. It keeps your screen clear of apps you use! The sound on this phone is awesome!! It also has different settings, concert hall is one of them!!It just comes with so many different options, like face recognition, register your irises, fingerprints, voice assistant...I could go on and on!!.Oh and it comes with one of the BEST headsets I've ever seen to date!!!! If you record music, you will love it!! It also has a wonderful large screen!!

"Perfect for my needs, your mileage may vary.","The Galaxy S9 was a replacement for an older generation Galaxy that could no longer hold all of the apps I use.My smartphone use consists primarily of voice, text, search, and GPS guidance functions and an occasional photograph.It also functions as an always available stand in for my Kindle. For me, the Galaxy S9 is the perfect combination of size, function, reliability and battery life.I've wrapped it in an OtterBox Commuter case coupled with a MagGlass screen protector to help protect it against the inevitable drops and impacts it will experience over time.It's menu system is simple and relatively intuitive although I'm sure I've missed some of its advanced functions since I haven't taken the time to download or read the full user manual.

Perfection.,Exactly as advertised. Brand new US Unlocked model of the Galaxy S9 (SM-G960U1). Works perfectly with all the sums I've tried (AT&amp;T &amp;Verizon) get better service with Verizon in my area. Being the unlocked model it isn't full of carrier bloatware so if you don't have a use for those many of them can just be downloaded. Completely satisfied.Also believe this phone pick up different waves than the S8 I used to get 3 bars consistently in my area with the S8 and I've had 4 with this one since I set it up.,2019年1月19日 在美国审核
Nice phone,"AT&amp;T is my service provider. I made an appointment at their local store and took the phones. They deleted our old phones and added our new phones to our account. Very quick, maybe five minutes each, and no charge. I am enjoying the added battery life, better pictures, much faster operations, and higher screen resolution. I do recommend you use the Samsung Smart Switch to transfer old data to the new phone. The AT&amp;T transfer program did an incomplete job. Have not used facial recognition or fingerprint reader yet, so can't comment on them. My choice of these phones (2) was based on research and friends owned for several years.

Beautiful Phone!,"Received my phone much sooner than promised after ordering it on Prime Day, originally was told Sept 5th then it was updated and I received it on July 21st.Right out of the box, I knew I would love this phone. I upgraded from a Galaxy J7. Took some flack from my boyfriend, like do you really need it? What's wrong with the phone you have? Well, Mr iPhone, maybe I wanted a better phone than yours!....and I got it!!Now about the activation....it's an unlocked phone, and my carrier,Virgin Mobile said it was not compatible with their service. So I called Virgin'scustomer service number only to be told I would have to call back from a different number than my cell to figure this out...well, I have no landline, and couldn't. My alternativewas to go online and switch to a different company.So, I ended up with Cricket Wireless,same unlimited service for the same price, but 9.99 for a SIM card that they will overnight me. Additionally, they are porting my phone number from Virgin Mobile, so hopefully the service is just as good, because I was with Virgin for several years and really liked them.The phone itself is beautiful, and I can't wait to try the 12 megapixel camera and the super slow motion video.Got a great deal on Prine Day, 345.00.

Unlocked is the way to go, so when I am out of country(USA) I can buy another chip and put it on it. Plus there are no carrier specific spams on it. It is faster since my Note 2 was ageing and slowed down. Else there is not much they can put on it. Camera results are amazing. Music, I find no difference.

Used - Like New: For the Win!,"Please note, it should have been obvious to me but it wasn't - this doesn't rate a full Samsung Warranty, because it technically isn't New. I got it from Amazon Warehouse, and the receipt doesn't include the IMEI. Feh...Still, about 4 months coverage available, more than a refurb unit would come with. Came in the box with some stickers stuck over the other outside stickers. Everything inside the box? Never taken out of the wrappers. Not even a smudge, let alone a scratch. Didn't want a battery that someone else had used already - no problem, no use at all. Perfect in that regard.What a beautiful little phone. Don't see much of the color except when I'm changing cases (story doesn't belong here...), but that blue is very nice. Battery life beats the pants off the Marshmallow S5's best day, I'm sure Oreo (and now Pie) have something to do with that. Even though it isn't the Qualcomm chipset, being USA and all, it still is more than fast enough. Got an unlimited Data Plan with the Sparq company, and zero problem with 4GLte watching March Madness. No lagging on any app, or while switching apps, that I've noticed. No feeling of remorse that I didn't wait and get an S10.Fits my hand, fits my needs, and the price was very nice. I've used Amazon Warehouse before, and was disappointed only once - and they took it right back. No problem this time at all. Used - Like New? For the Win!!",2019年4月6日 在美国审核

Although they look the same, the Chinese phone only sort of works (dropped calls, poor sound quality, incoming calls go straight to voice mail), does NOT have a US warranty (all support comes out of China), and critical features your carrier offers will be disabled (such as T-Mobile's Wifi Calling).It took me over a month to figure out why my wonderful Galaxy S9 was a piece of crap. And neither Amazon nor Samsung were of much help in discovering the source of my problem. It wasn't until I tried to register my phone with Samsung's U.S. website and failed that I got a clue.After much to do, Amazon replaced my Chinese phone with the correct one.

Best phone i've ever owned,"I used to buy cheaper moto g phones i'm glad I finally bought something decent.

I get a full day out of the battery using a mix of maps, camera and streaming music (normally for most of the day). The inclusion of wired AKG head phones is nice and the headphone port means there is compatibility with a range or portable amplifiers. I don't get why this isn't on other phones as not having it really limits your choice in headphones or you have to have a DAC/amp comb. Sound quality is good I from the onboard DAC/amp but I don't know about driving and thing larger than in ears. Bixby is ok, I tend to use googles assistant if i need to.

I then proceeded to transfer everything on my old phone to new phone by USB. it came with an adapter. It was easy and took much less time than it had indicated. The camera is the bomb. A lot of options. Most are pretty intuitive. One has a slider that allows you to make the background blurrier or clearer. I plan to read the manual on the others. The only think I am having trouble with is the brightness switching from inside to outside lighting. I thought I set it to adjust automatically but I have had to change it manually everytime I go outside. Again hopefully the manual with have an adjustment that works. The phone is very attractive.

Very good phone that isn't too large,"The reviews here seem to be for a mix of similar listings from different sellers, which explains why there are so many different kinds of reactions captured.<br>I bought this phone on Prime Day 2019. It was listed as being sold and shipped by Amazon. I'm not sure if it was described as being ""new"", but that's what I got. It was listed as ""unlocked"" but also as the ""G960U"" variant (whereas G960U1 is supposedly the factory unlocked model). The phone I got was in fact unlocked, and when I checked with different carriers (Verizon, T-Mobile, Spring, Mint, and Ting) all showed me that I could use the phone with them.As for the phone itself, so far so good. I chose this model for (1) it's relatively small size compared to other higher-end phones, (2) expandable storage via micro SD slot, (3) good camera, and (4) the general reputation Samsung has for build quality and durability (I hope).The S9 model is over a year old at this point, but that's OK by me--I used my S5 for 3.5 years, up to last week. The Samsung software ""bloat"" isn't too bad here, and I've read comments elsewhere that some of their apps (like the Internet browser) are actually pretty good, so I'm willing to give them a try. The edge screen makes me a bit nervous (the potential for being damaged) but a good case takes the edge off that. Camera quality seems good from my limited use, and battery life is good but not great (perhaps due to a recent security/updates patch).</br>",2019年7月24日 在美国审核
Big upgrade from my Galaxy S5,"There are other reviewers who know a lot more about the technical aspects of the phone. I can say that my experience has been positive. I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy S5, so this was a significant upgrade for me. I love the look and feel of the phone. It's fast and responsive. I no longer feel like I have to delete every unnecessary app to keep the phone from freezing up and crashing. The battery lasts all day without charging (I used to have to charge multiple times with my S5 and if I was using heavily, I was tethered to power constantly or it would die). I am satisfied with the sound quality. I listen to a lot of music and podcasts. Anyone who has used Samsung phones in the past should have no problem adapting to this phone.I love the finger print and face recognition to unlock the phone and various apps. I also used the Samsung Pay feature for the first time today and that was fun and easy.I do wish that I could get the home screens to wrap the way they did on my old phone, but that's the only thing I can think of that my S5 had that I can't do on this phone (and it's very minor).",2018年12月2日 在美国审核

Good phone except for Bixby and Samsung bloatware.,"I've had many Samsung phones and liked them.But my most recent phone was an LG V20, which I was also very happy with.The camera glass cracked after 2 years, and I decided to get another Samsung.Overall this is a great phone. I wish it was a little larger, so the same screen resolution yielded larger text and icons.I know I can adjust it, but on the V20 everything's a bit larger at the same resolution, because the usable screen is larger. But if you have good vision at that distance it won't bother you.One complaint I have is Bixby and the Samsung bloatware.I bought this unlocked so I wouldn't have the carrier bloatware, but Samsung puts on plenty of their own, and along with Bixby, you can't delete most of it, just disable it.It continues to nag me to use one of the apps.I don't know why they want to cram this down the user's throat.I already bought the phone.If I thought Samsung had better apps, I'd download them.But none of their built in apps are better than Google stock apps or other 3rd party. I'm not sure what the reason is for trying to push their apps on users.I guess to avoid thisyou have to buy a Google phone.",2018年5月13日 在美国审核
Very good phone so far,"I have not had many issues with this phone thus far. I always keep it in battery saver mode which can be frustrating for lack of certain notifications, but it seems to be fast, the size isn't too big for me, although one handed operation is limited compared to the smaller phone. Charge lasts all day without much use without power saver mode. Add a fair amount of use and power saver mode and still lasts all day.I couldn't justify getting a GS9 over a GS9+ because the battery life is better, 2 cameras, and an extra 2 GB of ram over the other device. I like this one for these extra features. Samsung made a quality phone, and I am happy to own it. I'd recommend charging the battery up to 85%, and keeping it above 35%, which may double your battery life (maintian 95% capacity after 4 years instead of samsung's 2 year guarantee)",2018年11月12日 在美国审核

Extremely worth it.!,"Coming from an iPhone 7 user. Samsung s9. A major go. Screen quality is beautiful, snappy and hardly any lag. Hopefully that keeps up with more apps installed. Great phone for multi-tasking and being productive. Watching movies is very immersive and would sometimes pick it over a TV. Adobe atmos gives higher quality audio with music and movies. Let's you customize bass and treble. Even instruments over vocals and works flawless. The single speakers has ample amount of sound. A tiny bit disappointed with the front camera but still better than my iPhone. Front camera really pops in colors. Battery life isn't nothing to be letting everyone you know about, but I will say it's pretty impressive. Ex Today I used about 4 hours of YouTube and Netflix and scimming through apps and other things pretty like a quarter of the day on top of the 4 hours. Its 8:35 and it's at 10%.

"So Far So Good, Shipping Went Well","Note that this review is of how the product arrived and first day thoughts, it's not in-depth of the phone long-term.Contrary to what a few other customers seemed to have experienced in some reviews, my phone came completely brand new and not tampered with at all. Everything worked fine from launch and all I had to do was transfer my SIM and SD cards over (I use Verizon, the SIM works just fine, no need to contact them.) There's nothing I can see regarding damage or issues with the phone related to how it was sent or what could have happened beforehand.I bought this phone unlocked and new in order to avoid the Verizon bloatware I never used but couldn't manage to get rid of. It was also nice to avoid the hidden fees attached to new phones bought through providers.My initial thoughts are: it's fantastic.The picture quality is stunning, especially coming from a Droid Turbo II (which was a nice phone for what it was, but the screen is so lackluster in comparison.) The camera is beautiful and I could easily say justifies the pricepoint for those looking at the market for photography in comparison to other phones I've seen and I haven't even touched many of the features.The speakers are surprisingly clear and sound great. I've noticed a trend with many smartphones from day one to just have... awful speakers for some reason. Maybe manufacturers assume you're using peripherals and Bluetooth at all times. Regardless, this phone covers that base better than most others.The slim and tall design feels much better in my hand than I was expecting it to, coming from a smaller phone.I love the shortcuts on this Android version and just how the entire Galaxy line operates in general. Samsung has always made stellar leaps in convenience mixed with modernization and the S9+ is no different.As far as Bixby goes: I don't use voice commands on phones, whether it be Bixby, Google Assistant, etc., period. I just avoid the Bixby button (my one caveat with this phone is part of the hardware being designed exclusively for Bixby) so it doesn't apply.I will update this later regarding other things like battery life, communication features, and anything else I can think of after using it for an extended period of time.",2018年8月24日 在美国审核

As is,"Bought from Amazon, not a 3rd party seller, which I would recommend. Came with everything that was advertised (charging cable + adaptive fast charging box, earbuds + extra bud pieces, USB connector for transfers, SIM tray ejector pin, and of course the Samsung 9 plus phone). Unfortunately, I couldn't use the S9+'s camera to take a picture of itself... so the image quality is from the S5. The camera quality of the S9+ is much sharper if you are seeking to upgrade from one of the older phones, the quality does drop a bit in the slow-mo settings but this is understandable for the feature. Since I have only been using the phone for a few days, I will refrain from commenting too much on the quality of the phone itself, but so far it is what I expected it to be and is performing as such. No hiccups thus far and worked fine while transferring my SIM over from my old phone (T-Mobile for anyone who is curious). The phone also has a lot of features that aren't super apparent, so I suggest you read a bit if you purchase it or do some research to fully utilize the phone.Disclaimer on the photo: the phone does not come with the case, glass screen protector, or the charms. Just didn't feel like taking them off to take a photo.",2018年12月4日 在美国审核
You should buy this phone,"Great phone - Being refurbished, I wasn't sure if I would have any issues with the products performance or reliability, and to my benefit, it turned out to be a great choice in a phone, and great purchase in general. It came in a fresh new box, in complete perfect condition with all accessories. The phone itself has been fantastic. After almost a year of ownership, I have never had any malfunctions or unexplained issues - it has a great camera, great battery life (nearly all day, about 10-13 hours with my experience, with moderate to heavy usage), a beautiful high quality screen, and performs over all like a premium, flagship smartphone. If you don't feel like spending the money you would be on a brand new phone, and don't want to go for a low price, low performing phone, then go with this one. I have no complaints.",2020年9月19日 在美国审核
Great Unlocked Phone,"I purchased this phone about 5 weeks ago. I needed something that was unlocked and that would work with AT&amp;T as my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 finally died. The phone has worked perfectly since it arrived. It came new in box with a power cord, wall adapter, and headphones. I did have to take it in to a store to get a new Micro SIM card as the one in my previous phone was the larger type and did not fit in the slot. The battery life is great and the cell signal comes in with no issues.",2018年12月31日 在美国审核
Great speakers and ram,"I love this phone. Got one for me and eventually got one for my wife since she liked mine so much.Best features are the extra ram (whole reason for buying 9+ over the 9, for me) and the speakers.

Works well with Verizon,"Just ordered this device to replace an older S7 Edge whose battery expanded on me and took the back of the phone out with it as it expanded - that phone was only three years old but well beyond its warranty.I hope the battery on the S9 won't go the way the S7 did.Enabling the S9 on the Verizon network only involved swapping the SIM card between devices.It confused me a bit because it was my understanding I would have to register the devices exchange on the Verizon website.It happened automatically after installing the old SIM card in the new phone.The device came with Android Oreo from February 2018 installed - needed a couple of patch updates.It also came charged 96%.The S9 has a smaller screen, it's a bit lighter and much more responsivethan the S7 Edge.It could also be that it's new so Android isn't as bloated, although it has all my data and apps moved over.Transferring data and settings was a snap - used the Samsung utility and USB cable adapter to do this.Good experience so far to get going, if something happens, I'll be back here to amend this review.Excellent experience so far with both the phone and Amazon's handling of it.",2018年9月24日 在美国审核

Amazing Phone!!,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S7 and this phone has been so much better. The battery life is definitely something to brag about here. I use this phone pretty heavily during the day and it lasts for a very decent amount of time. The fingerprint reader definitely one-upped its grandfather the S7 as it appears to authenticate much faster. The camera has really impressed me after the upgrade. The IP68 protection has definitely been taken advantage of when I want to have music playing in the shower. It’s nice not to have to worry about your phone getting damaged when you get splashed.In the case of most cell providers, you’re better off buying unlocked, as cell companies tend to jack the price up on this particular phone.

Better battery life than my S7 international.,"I'm moving from an S7 international 8 core to the S9 and so far I'm impressed.

Stopped working properly after a couple months!,"I purchased this phone some months ago and was extremely excited to try it out. It arrived perfectly with all the parts and pieces it was supposed to come with and for the first two months I was completely satisfied with my purchase. I'd also took measures and purchased a heavy duty phone case and a screen protector to make sure this puppy lasted me a while. However, two months in, my phone started unexpectedly freezing and the battery life was starting to decline rapidly. I had only used 18 of the 64 GB available but I took the time to clean out my storage and any unnecessary files anyways in hopes that the phone's behavior would improve. To my surprise, its performance was rapidly declining more and more by the days. Not long after it got to the point where my phone screen would randomly turn itself off and not turn back on. The phone would vibrate like it would when it was on when I'd press the home button but the screen would not light up. It would do this multiple times a day and I would have to manually soft reset it every single time. I reached out to Samsung support and was not able to receive any help or answers from them. By this point my 30-day warranty had already expired and Amazon would no longer be able to exchange the phone for me. I wish I had just spent a few dollars extra to make sure that I had received a reliable phone. Very unsatisfied",2018年11月15日 在美国审核

"Good Phone, Horrible Price","Bought this phone to replace my Droid Turbo after years of use, and I'm very happy with this one. In comparison to the other phones I've had, this one takes about 30 seconds to restart itself (which is wonderful if you're someone who usually only restarts it when it's absolutely needed). The picture quality is awesome as well as the sound quality. However, if you're playing music on full volume, there is a bit of a tinny noise in the background if it goes to a super loud part. I love the battery life, but be careful not to leave it plugged in after it fully charges to avoid shortening it. My biggest complaint is probably the case out of everything (which I realize isn't really the phone but kinda has to do with it). You see, this phone has a curved screen (which is unique but kinda a pain in the butt) and the way that Otterbox designs their cases for it, the screen protector piece is just a thick plastic part with adhesive which doesn't tuck into the sides of the case. While maybe this wouldn't be such a huge problem on flat screens, the curved screen made it ridiculous since the protector kept sliding and popping off. But if you can deal with that, I say go for it.Lastly, I know someone have had issues with activating it, but to be honest, I didn't run into any problems. I just brought it into Verizon and had them hook it up. I spent about ten minutes in the store overall.",2018年8月12日 在美国审核

Awesome phone,"This S9 is the fourth Galaxy I have owned; it is by-far the best one of all. This phone is more like a computer in my pocket than a phone in my pocket. The pricing was within my budget. It did not have a ""quick-start guide"" or an ""owner's operating manual,"" but that didn't bother me because I knew I could get an owner's manual on the Samsung website. No problem getting it, but 54 pages later, I couldn't find the information I needed. This did not bother me until I received the phone and had trouble figuring out how to ""make it work.""The operator's manual is written in a style that is ""WAY OVER MY HEAD!! AND the ""quick-start"" guide that came with each of my other Galaxy phones WAS NOT online.The young woman to whom I spoke (via text) at the Samsung Help-line was very helpful, told me all kinds of things to do, which most worked. However, 7 days later I still could not use features of my phone that needed an internet connection when I was not in-range of my internet. The seller did not put me in touch with his ""tech person"" or perhaps didn't have one, but instead kept telling me to call Samsung, but Samsung rep kept telling me to go back to the seller. In fact she even told me to consider returning the phone, as it appeared, to her, the phone was defective. The seller kept stalling me about a return and sounded like he had run out of patience with me and just wanted me to disappear.He finally told me to try resetting the APN. I should know what APN means??? He seemed very upset with me that I hadn't done that when I first turned on the phone. I would have, except the machine that walked me through setting up the phone did not mention the APN. In fact, he sent me a phone that had not been ""cleaned"" of the previous owner's data. I did a factory reset on the advice of the Samsung rep.I'm not mentioning the seller's name or company name. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt about the product he sold.",2020年7月28日 在美国审核

Everything I've been looking for in a phone.,"I'd like to start out by saying I've never had any of the previous galaxies, so I don't know how the S9+ companies to previous models. That saying, I absolutely love this phone. I recently switched to the Galaxy S9+ from the ZTE Axon 7 because of the limitations on that phone. The Axon 7 is a really good phone, and although it is an android, there are a lot of differences between that phone and Samsung Androids.The Galaxy S9+ has a great battery life, I charge it using the wireless fast charger in the morning before work and it will last all day through a 10 hour shift plus the gym. I like all the security features like the fingerprint scanner and face detection. It also has great memory and runs easily. I can do multiple things at a time and have multiple windows open and it's not a problem. The sound is also really good, I don't have to turn it up as loud to get the same quality music as with my old phone and the display for the screen is awesome. I take pictures and they look like they are in hd. By far one of my favorite features is the edge panel where you can put frequently used apps and contacts and such. I use that all the time.So far I have no complaints. I've been using this phone for about a month and I'm in love with it. Also buying it through Amazon using their store card and 24 month financing was a plus. That's the only way I could afford such a high price phone.I would definitely recommend this phone to someone else. I never rate anything 5 stars, but as of now the Galaxy S9+ is worth it.",2018年6月15日 在美国审核

Nothing short of amazing!,"This phone is nothing short of amazing! It's my first top of the line premium phone, and I never knew, until now, what I'd been missing. It is blazing fast, the screen resolution is fantastic, and it can do so many things that I will be constantly discovering new functions. The dual speakers with the Dolby Atmos, sound so absolutely terrific, it's amazing that Samsung can pack so much sound into such small speakers. My last Samsung phone was a Galaxy Mega with the 6.3"" screen, and I loved the huge screen on it, and that is my only lament about the S9+, it has a 6.2"" screen, so you'd think it isn't that much smaller, but it is quite a bit smaller. Not length-wise, but smaller by a bunch height-wise, and I've missed that on every phone I've had since. That is the one thing that would make the S9+ absolutely perfect for me, a screen that big, but, I'll live without it in exchange for how great the rest of this phone is. I highly recommend this phone if you can possibly afford it, it's really outstanding.",2018年7月21日 在美国审核

It works.Went out to my carriers website and already show up.No problems.The only thing you can not do with your carrier (you should check with yours) is that you can not get insurance on a phone unless purchased through your carrier.That being said, if I choose to get another phone, I will definitely be buying an unlocked one from here again.",2018年4月29日 在美国审核

I can't believe I scored this EXCELLENT phone for $280.96!,"I stumbled across this in the Amazon Warehouse &amp; couldn't believe the deal! I purchased the Lilac Purple, S9, Factory Unlocked, US Version, 128GB. This phone is in excellent condition &amp; appears brand new! The box did have a tiny bit of damage (paper was pealing on one side), but it came with the manual &amp; all original Samsung extras. I've attached pictures showing the minimal damage to box &amp; excellent condition of the phone. The listed description was ""Condition: Used - Very Good - Minor cosmetic imperfection on top, front or sides of item. Missing manual. Item will come in original packaging. Packaging will be damaged.""What I received was MUCH better!I've had the phone for maybe 3 hours total &amp; am still playing with settings. There are many features I haven't tried yet, such as face recognition. I also can't say how long the battery lasts, but I can say that the high speed charger is super fast. The phone came charged at 50%, &amp; it took maybe 45 minutes to reach full charge. My only complaint so far is the length of time that it took to receive my order. I ordered this phone on April 28 &amp; just received it today, on May 13. Yes; we are in the middle of a pandemic, &amp; I know that everybody is ordering things online which is slowing Amazon down, but 2 weeks felt like a lifetime. This phone was a replacement for my problematic phone &amp; I very badly needed the replacement ASAPPros:* I still can't believe that I got this phone for $280.96!* I LOVE the color!* It's in excellent condition! I'd honestly think it was brand new if I didn't know better.* I love that it has 128GB, with the ability to expand with an extra 140 GB micro SD card.* The camera is such a big improvement over what I had previously. The pictures above were taken with my old cellphone's camera. (The picture of my cat is the one shot I took with my S9).* I love the security features - face recognition, irises, &amp; fingerprints.* The screen is so much nicer, clearer, &amp; pleasant to look at.* It has a nice snappy response.* I love that I can use a wireless charger if I want to.Cons:* It take a long time to get here - stay at home order considered &amp; all.I wanted to post this review to help ease the mind of anyone considering purchasing it, but scared off by the negative reviews.

Birthday surprise,"Went out for my birthday on Saturday amd was seated poolisude for a romantic dinner...but my phonefell into the pool. Took the hosts over 15 minutes to retrieve my phone frm the bottom of the pool. I wasnt too far from hopping in there myself. I knew I would miss my phone but wasnt too perturbed about the pic since Iupload to Amazon Cloud.... Someoneseated at the table next to me said I sure hope that is an Iphone 8 then you have a chance..If not oh Well!!! I said nope,,,no Iphone. When at least the phone came out erytone wasamzed that it seemed undisturbed... screen as clear as daylight. They turned it off quicklyand went to put it in rice just incase. The usual advise to keep it turned off for 3 or so days. When i got home being theinquisitive person that I am...I turned it back on to sneak a peek. It was still as good as gold. No apparent water damage. I semt a text and turned it off. At that point I also wanted to credit the new phone case i had bought just over a month ago. I will do that separately but i did notice that it kept the back of my phone completely dry inspite of it being submerged all that time. I was certain that at least the charging port and other entry points would be ruined. I left it in the bag of Rcie for Sunday although visually i really had not reason to. So i decided to finally research the phone ...to my surprise i learned that it is water resistant and under some conditions can reminared submerged for up to 30 mins. So I turend it back on and have been going problem free. amsung S9 proved its worth. I am slo obviously very blessed. I would not suggest that you try itbut I can tell you if it gets wet you have a pretty good chance of being ok.I would still recommend the rice to draw away any water.",2019年9月9日 在美国审核

Nice phone. Battery wears out after a year,"I waited to review the phone because reviews on new things don't tell the whole story. I have loved this phone and have gotten a lot of use from it, being that I've used it for multiple businesses. I am simple so I haven't utilized all it's features, but it has been a great phone. It started out with a good battery but is now dead by 2pm on a full charge at 8 am. I do use it about 14 hours a day though. The battery has become unreliable in two years, but other than that I love this phone. It is very fragile. When it was new, I dropped it from the floor of my car onto my foot then the corner got the ground and the back screen cracked. It didn't harm its function. It has been in water a few times and has survived without change in function.",2020年8月12日 在美国审核

Phone size not for me.,"Now this phone would be the ideal phone for a younger person or ppl with small fingers and can see will. Since I’m either the reason for the stars. I went from a iPhone 6 Plus to this and have wanted to busted it up every since. It’s not the phones fault. It’s mine because I can’t see it well and my fingers are to big to text correctly. I’m always hitting button I didn’t mean to and have to erase and retype most of my text. Maybe should have went with the plus size. The volume is a little low for my hearing and I didn’t think my hearing was bad. I find sometimes I have to hold it up to my ear to hear somethings. I don’t know if it me or the phone. The battery life I have to charge it every night. I am not a person to stay on my phone all day. Just general text,Facebook and maybe play a game for a bit. There maybe things I can turn off to extend the battery which I have turned to YouTube for some advise but I still didn’t find anything to help extend the battery. Overall, after being so excited with getting a chance to have one of these phones I am disappointed with it. I’m 41 years old so I’m not over the hill. I wish I could go back and buy the plus version. So on this one be your on judge.",2019年1月10日 在美国审核

Can only use with SIM cards.,"I bought this phone because it could be used with CDMA and SIM cards both.I had planned on using Verizon at home and wanted to be able to purchase SIM cards to use in the phone when I travel internationally.But this phone appears to be an AT&amp;T phone that is ""unlocked"" so that it can also be used on T-mobile and presumably, other SIM cards.I have wasted a week's time, tried a couple of different SIM cards from a couple of different carriers, purchased a new SIM card, and am just DONE with this.Do not believe the Q&amp;A section where it says the phone can be used with all 4 carriers.It absolutely CANNOT.I will be returning this.",2018年10月27日 在美国审核

Texting and voice to text were deal breakers....,I'm not sure if it was just the phone or if the S9 actually isn't as good as I thought it would be.. I'm thinking it was the phone because I upgraded to the S9 plus and am now absolutely in love with it. I did order this one 1st though and had a lot of trouble with the voice to text. Actually texting was really hard in general too. That made it kind of a bummer to play around on because I use voice command a LOT. I decided to return it and just got my refund.. I am so thankful I was able to get that at least!! That's the only reason I rated at 3 stars instead of only two.,2018年7月30日 在美国审核

My best purchase on Amazon,"This is my first time buying an unlocked phone online and I feel like I got more than I bargained for. The Super AMOLED screen is hands down one of the best I have seen on a smartphone and I am enjoying it very much. Same goes for the speakers.In addition to that, I got to ""pixelize"" my phone, download tons of apps, files and I have to say I have not suffered from the infamous samsung lag, but if it does slow down at one point, samsung does have a function to test, diagnose and optimize your phone so I plan on taking advantage of that in the future.I'm also very satisfied with the battery. I'm a heavy user and so far it has been lasting me for a full day whereas my previous phone needed to be charged twice per day.As for the camera, I have yet to fully test what it's capable of, but I've taken a few low light pictures and have been quite impressed by how nice they looked.All in all this is a great phone and definitely a worthy purchase.",2018年10月23日 在美国审核

Awesome Phone! Love it More Every Day!,"UPDATE: Well, I've had my S9 plus for almost 2 mths now &amp; I see it more every day! It's so fast compared to my other phone! I'm really glad I took the plunge &amp; ordered this phone.I was really nervous about ordering this phone after reading the reviews, but after receiving it, I'm so glad I ordered from Amazon. I didn't order from a third party seller. The phone came packaged in a huge box surrounded by air pockets plastic. Everything was sealed and looked brand new. Still, the first thing I did was contact Samsung to verify that this was a new phone with a valid 1 yr warranty. They assured me that it was indeed new and had a 1 year manufacturers warranty. When I tried signing up for prepaid service, the IMEI number only worked with Verizon. After chatting with the sales reps online, he assured me that wifi calling would work. I was doubtful after reading multiple reviews online, but figured I'd it didn't, I could go with T-Mobile next month. I called Samsung again after signing up with Verizon and the rep at Samsung said my phone was unlocked &amp; would have worked with any carrier. Yesterday, when I got my Verizon Sim card &amp; put it in, no wifi calling. I checked again in a couple minutes &amp; boom! I had all kinds of features that weren't in my phone before including wifi calling and HD calling. So happy with this phone. It's lightening fast, the screen is brilliantly beautiful &amp; the pics it takes are unmatched. Plus, no unnecessary apps that I had on my Galaxy S7 Edge from AT&amp;T.

ugh - so many issues,"I love Samsung phones but not this one. I upgraded from a galaxy 6 to the 9. It has so many issues that I just went back to my 6. Positive: transferring everything from my 6 to the 9 was easy peasy. This phone has an incredible battery life even when I play games on it several times a day. That's about the only thing I really like about the phone. The thing I noticed the very first day was the picture quality was blurry on all my photos that I took. That's the main thing I use the phone for. I tried several settings, but photo quality still remains to be an issue.For the first few weeks, my phone would actually show me notifications as to when I had emails, but then that just stopped. I checked every setting and even turned on the sound for the emails. Nothing. I did the 7 ""fixes"" suggested to fix this including downloading different launchers, and doing a reboot of the phone (several times). Nothing. I need to absolutely need to know when I have emails especially now that I'm taking classes again. Even if it did show a notification, if I opend the email app, it would delete the notfication. This wans't a problem to keep something in notification status on the 6. Fingerprint scanner doesn't work majority of the time. I just look like some idiot stroking my phone. creepy. haha. In addition to about 15 other issues listed about this phone, my app that unlocks my house when I arrive stopped working. Tried everything to fix that. nothing. I thought it was the app. But the minute I switched back to my 6, the app started working again. So, now I believe it's because of the 9. This has been the worse phone I have ever had.

Ships from AND SOLD BY Amazon,"I did not like the curved screen at first. But I ended up really liking it. It really is a beautiful phone. I haven't really messed either the camera yet but the quality looks great. It's a super fast phone. Games run smooth. Call of duty mobile ran great. Pubg ran great.I have never had a phone this big. I even have a bulky case on it but I am used to it. The speakers are real good. Nice and loud. The wifi signal hasn't disconnected yet. The battery is okay. I don't use my brightness all the way. Seems like it drains a little fast. I think the problem here is that background apps are being run. There are a lot open tabs you can forget about too. They do not close automatically.Battery tip : Dont let your battery drop below 40% and dont charge it past 80%. This is called the 40/80 rule. You can look it up yourself to decide.That being all said if you want to make sure you are getting a brand new phone then buy from Amazon directly. ""Ships from AND SOLD BY AMAZON."" Lots of people on here are unhappy because they buy from 3rd party sellers. If you buy from Amazon directly (assuming you want a brand new phone) the phone is completely brand new and unopened with everything included that was originally suppose to be included. Ebay has this weird thing where vendors will list an item brand new but going into the product details they clearly state it has been opened. Already opened = not brand new.",2019年10月11日 在美国审核
Horrible phone for the price,"The speakers, as in call speakers to. Un usuable. To many weird little features that you'd never know or use ever or be able to remember but make the phone more difficult to use then intuitive. The swiping is difficult to open menus and navigate. I feel the service is subpar to. The camera for the cost isn't great at all and it's actually REALLY hard to take pictures with the phone. Even just trying to take simple pictures of skinny things up close it just couldn't deal. The phone was also in rough shape and for the only SLIGHT price break missing everything like the wireless charger phone case screen protector etc was a real bummer. Another HUGE deal breaker was the battery. I don't even game on this phone just social media and I find myself needing to charge the phone 2-3 times A DAY. Over all it feels like this phone was a cash grab on samsungs part and I've used phones 15 years old that feel better then this one. The screen is also soooo hard to use and the phone is difficult to grab. Hate to leave such a harsh review just they really missed the mark with this phone. The screen being nice and bright and high res is offset by the low battery and the bevels that feel like they distort things and give weird reflective effects. Will be returning.",2020年10月30日 在美国审核

Amazon doesn't tell you in package that the warranty is not a full year,"When I called Samasung tech support about the S9+ muffled quality of the phone's microphone (complaints from people I've called), I discovered, from Samsung, there was only 5-months of warranty remaining. The phone is supposed to have a 1-year warranty.Calling Amazon, they now tell me that the warranty began when they took possession of the phone, not when I take possession of the phone. Now, Samsung includes all the warranty information in the packaging, however Amazon doesn't deem it necessary to provide clear-and-full disclosure of this important bit of information. This lack of full disclosure could be extremely expensive. To be clear, you're getting a perfectly new phone from Amazon but...without the full warranty.I am, of course returning the phone. Sad, that I have been very pleased with Amazon for a long time only to discover this lack of clear disclosure in the packaging. I am well aware the phone has a 1-year warranty, but you must dig through the fine print to find this is not true if purchased through Amazon. If your new phone is sitting on a shelf in their warehouse, then your warranty is slowly expiring.After discovering this, I had no interest in trouble shooting a problem with the S9+ micorphone which turns out to NOT be compatible with the new, higher-quality, high-security standard of VoLTE phone calling. With the S9+, you're paying for this feature on this next generation phone -- though Samsungs product, here, is flawed. Samsung's work around is to deactivate your 4G VoLTE feature. This means audio and Video calls are reverted back to the fuzzy dark ages.",2019年1月29日 在美国审核

Swap sim card and go,"Before receiving my phone I received an email from reliant cellular (the seller) giving me instructions on how to resolve an issues should any arise.

I easily took the sim card out of my old phone (I used a pay as you go phone plan through simple mobile) inserted it and started using it. I will be switching plans because my carrier just doesn't cover enough areas that I tend to travel, but when I do switch, again I will be able to just swap out the sim and continue where I left off. I was initially concerned during start up that it wasn't unlocked due to a ton of mentions and programs for Verizon, but it is unlocked.My battery lasts me all day, unless my kids are watching endless videos.

Beautiful Phone!,"I upgraded from a S6 Edge+, and I'm a Samsung girl for life.This phone ran beautifully right from the get-go. It's not too bulky, I have no problems using it with one hand.The camera is awesome. I've been playing with it since I got it out of the box!I'm still getting used to the new operating system and layout. I've been used to the Galaxy's home button, and the back and multi-screen buttons, so it's interesting adapting to a completely smooth device.Where the apps icon was on the home screen, is now the camera icon. If you're upgrading like I did, you have to flick upwards to get to the apps. But this is not, in any way, a downside.The speakers are great, and listening to music through earphones is awesome.I absolutely love this new phone!

"Bought from Amazon, activated with Sprint","I just started using this phone so too early for a definitive review.I am mainly going to address some issues brought up by others since there are a lot of problems people are writing about.One of the big issues with these reviews is that people don't usually include who was the actual seller of the product.As most hopefully realize, just because you buy a product on Amazon doesn't mean it was actually sold by Amazon.Many third party sellers sell through Amazon.This is especially a problem for electronics where there are so many variations in model numbers and ""gray market"" devices one could end up with an expensive paper weight.I suspect that is the source of many of the issues with this product.Make sure you know the seller.My invoice shows: ""Sold by: Amazon Services, Inc."" While you may get the correct item from another seller you also could get a lemon without any customer support. Also make sure it specifically states ""New"" if that is what you want and whether a US Warranty (or the correct warranty for your country) is included.Gray market goods typically don't have a warranty.Also see if the item comes with Amazon support.My Galaxy S9 specifically stated 90 day support from Amazon for any issues.I bought the 128 gb version of the S9 to replace a Galaxy S7 Edge.This is the 4th galaxy device I've had so I am familiar with the setup.Once the device arrived I turned it on and enabled Wif Fi to get it up and running as much as possible.I then used the installed ""Smart Switch"" software from Samsung to transfer everything from my old phone to the new one.I couldn't get it to work wirelessly but using the cable and included adapter it worked without a hitch.I then attempted to use the sim card from my old phone to get activated on my existing Sprint account.The sim card is in a tray at the top edge of the phone.Use the included tool or paperclip to open the tray.I was unsuccessful in activating through the phone and online. I called Sprint customer service and they attempted to activate from their end.That was also unsuccessful.Likely issue was my old sim card was not compatible. No problem he said just go to a Sprint store and they will get you a new card for about $3.Next day I did just that.The woman who helped me was not familiar with the process of someone bringing in their own phone but with help from the supervisor I got the new card and the phone activated in about 15 minutes.The actual charge: $0!So the answer to the question do these unlocked phones really work is yes. Just make sure you are getting an authentic model (by buying only from a reputable seller), have a little knowledge and get some help from a knowledgeable cell phone network company employee.Other things to note: the S9 uses a ""type C"" USB cable. This is different from the micro usb cables from the S7 and other models.It is a different size connector and enables ""fast charging"". One cable is included but you may want to get additional ones for the car or as spares - or get a wireless charging pad. the S9 can use a micro SD card for additional storage.If your current phone has one you can simply install it in the new phone or buy a new one.Couple additional items of note: the home button is now virtual instead of physical. One of the implications of this is the fingerprint sensor is now on the back near the camera lens. I find this to be awkward especially when operating one handed. However you can use facial and iris recognition instead to unlock the phone. You can also choose not to lock when at a specific location however it hasn't worked for me so far.",2019年7月21日 在美国审核

With this S9 worries no more for it is 128 GB! I love the quick smooth response! I was able to update too!I was also able to use a case I bought for it thats not available for the S10e yet. (They have all the cool cases on ebay.)I knew of the S10 &amp; plus but not of the S10e, oh well, my bad....After playing with the S9 I just couldn't send it back....I think this S9 is just as great so far.

Some down sides but recommended,Has the typical OEM bloatware as well as some Google and third-party software that can't be removed. The hardware Bixby button is an obvious attempt at overriding Google assistant.It's very easy to activate unintentionally.A Samsung account is necessary to use their competing features; even some that don't make sense to need an account.The screen is brilliant and beautiful. The curved edges give it an attractive illusion of depth. Battery life is very good and recharge is very fast.Samsung has the best swipe and predictive qwerty of all brands I've owned.I'm very happy with my purchase.,2018年11月23日 在美国审核

First Galaxy Phone I Haven't Liked,"I've had Samsung Galaxies for years (Galaxy S4, S7, and now S9). The S9 is the first one I haven't been totally satisfied with. At least the specific one I have is glitchy, and it has features I don't like. I wouldn't have chosen the infinity screen (I like to have at least a real back button), and there are other things new to this phone that I don't like. For example, when I want to set something up in my Alexa/WiFi network, I have to use my old Galaxy S7 that I still have to actually get it to work. I've tried over and over to set things up through my S9, but to no avail. Good thing I still have the S7 and can do everything other than call and text via WiFi. I feel like the S9 made no improvements over the S7, and there are definitely things that are worse in my opinion.

"Phone freezes, won’t dial out, the antenna weak, callers complain about sound quality, Swipe bad.","The phone does every great, EXCEPT the actual phone part is horrible.I’m probably going to return it.Calls drop every day.It won’t dial out unless I restart it.This happens whether the call is WiFi or via the carrier.This did not happen with my last 6 phones.Same carrier for last 6 phones, but this ""Flagship"" is a POS WITH A CAPITAL ""S"".In addition, it does not hold its value.It’s unbelievable to me that a OnePlus will sell on EBay for 95% of its purchase price every 6 months when the new version arrives.But I bought this on Cyber Monday for $547 plus tax with a normal price of $899 and it’s selling on EBay in the 400s!that’s ridiculous drop in value compared to OnePlus.My biggest complaint is failure to dial out.I’ve tried rebooting.I’ve tried resetting everything.I’ve called my carrier.While the camera is exceptional, it FAILS at being a phone!!!!!!UPDATE JAN 24, 2019 - I received a replacement.The replacement had the same defects as the original, PLUS The volume from speakers was lower.It is unworthy to be called a flagship.It looks nice.It has a nice screen.It has a terrific camera.It is a LOUSY phone - it’s main function.It is Filled with Samsung Bloatware.AND the predictive swipe texting on both phones was the worst at predicting words of any phone I’ve ever owned.The keyboard sucks in swipe mode.Horrible.I’m going to OnePlus (no bloatware) or Apple (security and just great products).",2018年12月17日 在美国审核

"It was reset, but locked to AT&amp;T","December 5th, 2021 @ 10:54 PM CDTAfter jumping through hoops with AT&amp;T's terrible customer service representatives and those reps eventually understanding that I don't want to switch service providers and I don't want to be an AT&amp;T customer they finally directed me to the part of their website that allows their customers to request their phone be unlocked.After AT&amp;T verified the phone was paid for, not stolen, and so on they gave me a code to use during set up with my service provider that did allow me to use my preferred service provider.My mom has been happily using her new Galaxy S9 phone for 1 month. It works great. Genuine new phone look, performance, and battery life. The phone came with all the right accessories in a genuine Samsung Galaxy S9 box.So long story short if you don't have time to jump through hoops for a reset but not service unlocked phone then keep looking.But if you do have the time and patience to deal with that then it is a quality product and I highly recommend purchasing it.------------------------------------------October 25, 2021 @ 11:50 PM CDTSo I bought this phone (Samsung Galaxy S9 - 64GB - Coral Blue).I should also mention that I am already a proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy S9 so I can say that physically this (Amazon) phone feels and looks the same as mine, I bought this phone on Amazon to give to my mom.It does have a valid IMEI number and I got Samsung to verify that the device is a legitimate Samsung phone.Now for the problems it is NOT factory unlocked as advertised and rather it is locked to AT&amp;T. I've put in a request on &lt;https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/&gt; and I should know if it can be unlocked.My concern though is the seller lied about it being factory unlocked so was this phone lost, stolen, has past due balance, some other horrible thing in its past I don't know.------------------------------------------I'll update this review after I hear back from AT&amp;T.But needless to say, if AT&amp;T won't unlock the phone then I'll be returning it to Amazon immediately.------------------------------------------",2021年10月26日 在美国审核

BUYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was SO excited to get my new phone... I opened the Amazon box(in tact) to find a Samsung Galaxy S9 box. The outer sleeve of the box was dented and ripped. First I was disappointed because I did not order a used phone, I ordered a new phone and expected a new looking box. I then took the sleeve off and finished opening the box only to find that there was NO PHONE in the box at all, no phone, no charger, no nothing!!!!! I am so disappointed and furious I could scream. I spent a lot of money on the phone. I called Amazon and the woman told me there was nothing they could do. She told me that they needed to start a 3 day investigation. No reassurance, nothing. They told me to call them back in 3 days. I am guessing they have some internal theft going on?? Not sure what else it would be. I order from Amazon all the time. I rarely have an issue, but this makes me rethink ordering from Amazon, or online at all. Has anyone else had something like this happen???",2018年10月29日 在美国审核

Nice phone until it stopped charging 3 months in,"So if the phone worked I'd give it 4 or 5 stars but not being able to charge by wire is a very big bug apparently not too uncommon for this phone.I can charge it wirelessly, I can connect the phone to my laptop and perform the Samsung Smart Switch backup process, but for some unknown reason it fails to charge through the USB port.Service to Samsung has been above average but its outsourced overseas scripted help - this takes extra time spent try to explain the symptoms and get the desired support.Naturally with a suspect hardware error I now have the undesirable task of shipping the phone to them, waiting for it to be repaired/replaced, and then waiting for the return,From what I'm told that sounds like a two week turnaround.This is a flagship phone.Samsung is a big seller of these phones.Support should be much stronger IMHO - such as accelerated return and repair for such a new phone.Battery life has been good, wifi and bluetooth have been solid and aren't draining my battery, screen look great, find the Bixby button to be in an annoying location often accidentally pressed and then more time wasted to cancel it.Have had no system locks or unexpected reboots unlike my former platform.Wish it did other things that the last phone did such as hands free txt while driving.The email apps I've used thusfar leave desirable room for improvements such as the ability to place email folders at the home screen - less clicks to see stuff.",2019年2月17日 在美国审核

Pleasantly surprised! Excellent phone!,"As described. Very happy with my purchase.Always hesitant on large $ transactions when it seems too good to be true.No regrets.It took some time to get it updated with software/music from my previous phone, but after that process was completed I found that making the transition from HTC U11, which I absolutely love, to Samsung Galaxy, is not going to be as bad as I'd feared. Been using HTC since the M7, trying different phone brands off and on throughout the years, but always coming back to HTC. Instead of getting the newest HTC U12, I bit the bullet and decided to make the change before I was forced to.Very happy I did. Chose to go with the 9+ because it was a little older and less expensive than the new ones, and I couldn't pass up the prime days sale. This is my first Samsung Galaxy phone, it's easy to use and has great graphics. I haven't had an opportunity to use it for normal day to day yet, but battery life appears better than my HTC.Not sure if I'm a convert yet, but I'm well on my way to having the Samsung Galaxy being my new go to phone brand.",2019年7月20日 在美国审核

"Great Phone, Switched from Apple to Android","I cracked my iPhone screen and was debating on what upgrade I should get if I stuck with Apple products and decided to start looking up information on comparable android devices. I read reviews on the Galaxy S9 plus and liked what I was reading about what all the phone had and can do. Amazon Prime day just happened to have this phone for sale at a good price and I took the plunge into the Android world. I've now been using the phone for about a week or so and have to say this was an easy switch as there are so many functions on the phone that I wish the iPhone had. I am enjoying learning what this phone is capable of and it's pretty easy to do.The camera is one of my favorite things as it takes very clear pictures.One thing I am not liking is some of the touch functions or how slow things ""open"", like a picture or comment on Facebook. Not sure if there are options I have to adjust or it's just an issue with that app in general. Overall, I am so far liking what the phone offers and can't say I regret switching.",2019年7月25日 在美国审核

Camera's glass cover cracked after two 3 days,"Wow. After 3 days of using (without a single drop) I've noticed the camera's glass cover is cracked. Next day I am already having dust particles under it. Quick google and I see I am not the only one (there are many). I've noticed this last night after I left a warm building and on the outside it was pretty cold. The funny thing is that many other users with this problem noticed that the temperature difference might be the problem. And yeah, most of them have owned their samsung phones for only few days/weeks too. So it seems like if it doesn't happen to you in few weeks/months after buying then you are safe. I am extremely disappointed. I own old iphone SE, nexus 5 and iphone 4 where the last one is being used by my kid as a toy (!!) and non of these have broken either front glass or camera glass.",2018年11月27日 在美国审核
"Not a Samsung fan, but this is an excellent phone","I needed a new phone and was in the market for a deal. Based on the prioritizing of my needs and wants for this new phone, after much analysis I settled on a low end Samsung S10 (potentially a high end S10e) or a high end S9+. The finals were fought out by S9+ 6GB RAM vs S10e 8GB RAM. In the end the S9+ won out despite less RAM but a much better screen, battery, patch level and procedures point. The price difference for the best price at the moment was about $300. To me saving $300 was worth sacrificing 2GB RAM while also having better screen and battery life.So far, this phone has held up very well. For a sole negative I'd say the camera sometimes act a little glitchy but this, I'm hopeful, will get fixed with a firmware push.",2019年7月14日 在美国审核

Unless I break it, will probably be the last phone I ever buy, as I am a 77 year old grandmother.I still need some tips on muting the phone &amp; turning it back on without going into settings &amp; volume, but will have to check in with my carrier to see if this is even possible.It used to be long ago on an earlier Samsung S model, but things change.Basically well satisfied.",2020年7月14日 在美国审核

Amazon Warehouse Did Not Disappoint,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S9 Like New from Amazon Warehouse Deals and NOT an authorized seller. I wanted an extra $50 off cause someone touched the phone but then returned it. I work in education; I'll take any deal I can get. I also made sure the phone came with original packaging (It was stated in the condition description).So far, I am very pleased with this purchase. The phone is lovely. It came with the plastic still on and all the original pieces such as headphones and the little tools for popping out the sim card. It does not come with a charger so I picked some up in a separate order.I have AT&amp;T. Getting my service sorted was a bit tricky but it is set up and everything is working now. I went to one store and the agent switched the sim card and checked calling service but not my data. I left, I shopped, and then suddenly realized that my internet wasn't working. Went to another store but the agents were useless and only wanted to sell me stuff that was irrelevant to my issue. So it goes. I went home and called AT&amp;T. Three agents and an hour later I rolled a yahtzee and Mark the Advanced Tech guru came on the phone. We did a bunch of stuff on the phone having to do with my IMEI and APN. Neither immediately worked. Finally, he had me hang up and turn my phone off so he could ""zap it."" He called me back after, cause that's the kind of class act Mark is. Huzzah! My mobile data was working without issue.One disadvantage of buying the phone Like New is that the warranty was started by the person who first bought it. It does not say anywhere in the Amazon description when the phone was first purchased. I registered the phone with my Samsung account and it shows that the warranty started in June. I am therefore assuming that's when the first owner registered it. It is beginning of Dec. now. If I anticipated really using the warranty (I don't) I might find this annoying.I'll also point out that I bought this phone with my Discover during an Amazon cashback quarter. The 5% cashback covered my state tax. This saved me an extra $30 that I put toward a microsd card for more storage.If anything goes wrong with this phone, I will update in the future. So far, I am tickled lilac with my Like New Amazon Warehouse Deals phone.",2018年12月2日 在美国审核

I was skeptical but it's working out fine!,"The reviews made me very nervous, so I watched MANY YouTube videos on how to spot a fake phone lol.To be honest the only sketchy thing was the box- it definitely was not in the original box and it didn't have a product sticker on the box.All the contents in the box though...look legit.So far this phone has been working well for me the past few days.It was easy to switch my info from my iPhone SE, and update my existing Verizon line.No hiccups in the process!The only issue I have been having is connecting to my Honda Bluetooth...but I think that may be more of an Android/Samsung issue overall based on reviews I've read.The photo is great and it works for my needs.Upon inspecting the manufacture warranty, it shows that the phone warranty expires in December 2019 (which is less than a year from now).So, I put in a ticket with Samsung to see if my warranty date can be modified since I just got the phone, hopefully they will honor my request.But the phone seems legit! It is in Samsung's database and compatible with Verizon.Should anything change about how it works- I'll be sure to add it to this review.*Update*-Samsung updated my manufacture warranty to July 2020 :-)-I think I need to use the MirrorLink app to use my phone in my car.I am contacting Samsung support on how to do this since the YouTube videos are confusing.*Update #2*I realized the reason why my bluetooth wasn't linking to my Honda was because I had too many devices linked lol oops...So Bluetooth works perfectly now and the MirrorLink works as well.COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this product right now.",2019年7月30日 在美国审核

"High Quality Product, but Not as Advertised","I bought this phone when it was on sale. The webpage said I bought the phone from burnt circuit. Well, why is it that I bought a new unlocked phone and was sent a phone that was Verizon locked and had missing equipment in the box? The box wasn't sealed, and the akg headphones that come standard with every galaxy s9/s9+ were lacking the AKG logo found on every pair of their headphones.There was no SIM card remover, nor any adapters for transferring data from an old phone to this new phone. I verified that this was in fact a real galaxy s9 by looking up the IMEI number and doing a test using CPU-Z.

I tries to change the screen brightness and blue filter and it looked like crap. My mom has the same phone through her carrier and the dofference waa obvious. This is not at all what I expected. I bought on prime day and then the next day when i checked on my order to see what the warranty info was for my huaband whp asked, i was shocked that the link brought me to a used listing for less than I paid on prime day leading me to believe this was a phone advertised as the deal of the day to make more than it was worth. Fairly certain these are lightly used or defective factory unlocked phones to try and liquidate for the company. Not okay amazon. Not ok. I bought 2 and returned both the same day I received them.

Works Great After Being Submerged in Water 11 Days,"This is a miracle phone. I slipped on the ice in Lake Huron in Mackinaw City and the phone fell through a crack. The ice was so thick that we couldn’t break it to get it out. At the time, the water was 34 degrees and I figured it was a lost cause. I was passing by 11 days later and thought I would check to see if I could find it (with no real expectation of finding it). Fortunately, there hadn’t been any strong waves and the phone was laying face down in the water, right where I fell. I stood it up against a baseboard heater for about 12 hours. I then stood it up on a paper towel (in a cupboard so I wouldn’t be tempted to plug it in) at room temp for about 60 hours. I charged it and it worked perfectly.I would recommend this phone to anyone who was accident prone.It has takes great photos, has ample storage, and rarely has any glitches.",2019年7月27日 在美国审核

Some of the reviews had made me nervous but it isn't scratched, used, or missing all together. It even has the SmartSwitch paperwork, user guide, health warnings, and extra ear bud caps (still sealed). My only complaint isn't with the phone, but with the delivery person.

This leads me into 2) Samsung apps - or should I say bloatware.

Battery life is much better than the S7 I used to have. With minimal use could probably go a day and a half to two days. With my fairly frequent user it lasts all day. Extensive use, it will last through the work day (i.e. listening to audible for hours on end while navigating extensively on Google maps all day and also looking up other things).

Samsung Galaxy S9,"I was highly disappointed when I received a locked device rather than ""unlocked"" as advertised. I was however very pleased with the speed in which I received my replacement, which was the very next day. I contacted amazon and the replacement was sent without even having to return locked device first, something that surprised me.There was no damage to the box or any missing pieces, the device came brand new as expected (even the locked device was in excellent condition). It's been roughly 2-3 weeks since I've been utilizing my device, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I have had no issues so far *knock on wood*, and it was an easy switch moving from the Samsung S6 to the S9.So despite the initial hiccup with the phone being locked, the speed in which it was rectified definitely made up for the initial mix up.

Beware carrier features will not work on unlocked phones.,Buyer beware. Unlocked phones do not support some carrier features like video calling and wifi calling. I bought this s9 plus to use on Verizon wireless and these features are blocked. The reason they are blocked is because it's an unlocked phone and Verizon wants you to spend the big bucks buying the phone from them to use all the features the phone supports. It BS really but that's just how it is. So if you buy this or any unlocked phone then you can expect some of the features not to work. I warned you.,2018年11月28日 在美国审核

Excellent Used-Like New Phone But  With Insurance Problems,"First let me say that the Galaxy S9+ is a big beautiful phone. The screen is outstanding, the speed is fast and it has more features than I ever probably learn to use. Definitely a first-class phone from Samsung.What I really want to say is: I purchased this Galaxy S9+ from the Amazon Warehouse at great price with an additional 20% discount. I was concerned about purchasing a Used-Like New phone but my son, who had previously worked at Amazon, said those phones were in new condition and a great buy. He was right.The phone was without a scratch and had a clean esn. It came in the original box ( a little beat up) with all the original accessories still wrapped up. Activation was no problem and it is working great. And it was half the price of a new phone! Half price for a Galaxy S9+! I am so happy and will recommend to my friends who are shopping for new phones to check out the Amazon warehouse deals.UPDATE: I am taking off one star because I cannot get insurance on phone. Amazon will not provide nor even offer insurance on own product. There are two insurance providers on Amazon, SquareTrade and Asurion, but neither will cover used Amazon phone.

"Great phone, but fragile camera glass","I bought this phone at the end of last summer. Like all my phones, I immediately put it in a case. It has served me very well and continues to do so but like many others (I have just now realized via a short internet search) my camera screen is now broken. I reached in my pocket a few days ago but felt something off. The glass that covered my camera was shattered. It look like a small bullet or something shot it though there was nothing else in my pocket to have done so.The Big Con:The primary reason I bought this phone was as an upgrade to it's camera capabilities. With the lens gone, I currently have a piece of clear tape over where the glass used to be however that makes it hard to take pictures as you can imagine.This seems a major flaw in the phone and as far as I've been able to understand from samsung.com that because it is physical damage it is not covered under the one year warranty.I teach high school science and we are currently under strict quarantine in the state I'm in. As our schools quickly adopted an online format I was hoping to start using my phone to record videos of me to stay in touch with my students as there's more versatility on it compared to my school-loaned Chromebook. Sadly I'm not sure what to do next outside of buying a new phone.The Pros:Outside of the issue I am facing, the phone works well as a typical smart phone. With the camera covered up I'm not too worried about dust making it's way into the phone and it is still functioning as a smart phone just fine.I can access my school emails quickly and successfully, it's awesome at surfing the web, and 64 GB of storage sure beats the 32 I had on my previous phone.I play a handful of games on my phone. They all run smoothly and I don't believe I've encountered any moments where my phone has crashed due to activity.I love the phone but I can't help but be heartbroken at the moment.I would highly recommend the phone to anyone who does not mind the high-than-normal risk of losing your main camera capabilities the way I did.

"Many great features removed. fast, great sound &amp; memory. Hate Bixby, curved screen &amp; sealed battery.","So different from previous models.

Why galaxy? Praying battery lasts.Very complex phone with long learning curve. Too many options! Hate curved infinity screen, bixby &amp; edge. Useless waste!64 gb memory is great so far. Once you buy alexa you need so much more internal memory.Not sure how long battery will last. Crossing my fingers since it can't be replaced.Why on earth did they use curved infinity screen? Very hard to find case and screen protectors that work.Phone is so fragile.What is value and purposeof ""bixby""?

Loving My New Phone,"I had a Galaxy S4 for several years. It was suitable and did the job. . . mostly. I was having some battery issues and my phone wouldn't update past Android 4.4. I was running into apps that needed a newer version of Android. I could have bought something cheap but I decided to treat myself and found the blue Galaxy S9 on sale for a decent price. I have to say I'm loving this phone.The 5.8"" Quad HD+ Super AMOLED screen is GLORIOUS! I run this is high performance mode with the brightness cranked up. Games, movies, even YouTube and TikTok videos look amazing. The curved edge I worried might be distracting but honestly I only notice in a couple games.Sound is really good for a cell phone it has stereo speakers. Volume is more than enough.Performance from the Octa-Core processor and 4GB of ram have not struggled to run anything I've thrown at it.The camera is great. Maybe struggling a little in very bright light with a light colored subject. Otherwise, night mode gives great low light results. Video shooting is very nice with great slow motion results and a nearly unique superslow-motion recording mode at a mind boggling 960 frames per second is a lot of fun to mess around with.Battery life is good, I got most of a day is high performance mode and could easily extend it by cutting things back to save battery.The fingerprint sensor is quick to unlock and easy to use. A trick I found online to improve performance of the fingerprint sensor is to register the same finger more than once. It really works like a charm.The look is sleek and sophisticated though I'm protecting that glassbody with a nice Otterbox Symmetry case. The only real minor negative to the whole thing is this weighs more and is larger than my S4, a little hard on my hands and pocket but really, it's worth it.I can't express how happy I am with this phone. I'm even buying props and things to use in creative videos and photo shoots.",2019年11月10日 在美国审核
cracks easily,"My only complaint with this phone is the curved edge screen. Makes it very easy to crack, mine cracked within a month of owning it.

Would definitely recommend to someone looking for an upgrade, especially if they don't want to pay more for similar performance on something like, say, the iPhone X.

The display is pretty awesome, nice colors, and the storage capacity is great, as well as the added benefit of adding an sd card for extra memory. The speed of the phone is high, even if you have a lot of apps open, probably due to the 4 gb ram. Superb performance overall. Impressed me for sure.",2018年4月2日 在美国审核

Im in the U.S.A.. I just disabled them. Still able to use everything else.2) One side of the phone was smudged with dirt, as if it was in a case. With all this Covid-19 crap going around.

"Not an original unlocked phone, but functionally the same.","I bought this ""used, very good"" from SikkSound, and it seems to be in what i'd consider very good condition. It's NOT a G965UZKAXAA (which is ordered unlocked direct from Samsung), but it IS a G965U1 (totally unlocked) so it functions exactly the same as one that's ordered unlocked from Samsung. Mine is originally a G965UZKAVZW (Verizon phone) which I discovered through the Samsung Members app. I'm mildly disappointed it's not an original unlocked phone, but that's only because I'm weird like that. The phone works with T-Mobile perfectly fine, and they didn't even give me any fuss at the store trying to claim it might lack features because I didn't buy it there (which would have been bogus because all snapdragon S9+ are physically identical). The screen had some very minor hairline scratches, but I can't see them at all now that I put a screen protector on. There was a little bit of paint wear around the camera, but for half the cost of a new one, I can live with that. I think my biggest gripe is how quiet the speaker is. If there's any amount of environmental noise around me (riding in a car, at an event, in wind, etc) I have to hold the phone close to my head to hear the speaker. At that point I might as well just take it off ""speaker"" and use the ear speaker.Overall, I'm very pleased so far.",2019年7月24日 在美国审核

Phone is great but buying on Amazon... not so much.,"I bought this phone brand new from amazon... it was very clearly used.The phone had been set to spanish (us) and already had a folder labeled ""Applicacions de Microsoft"" on it and the message app spelling dictionary only had the option for spanish (us).Cant trust anyone these days.On the bright side they included a phone case for free lol! Thanks who ever sent me this phone I appreciate that.It is a SM-G9650 (Snapdragon 845) cpu but because of that its region is set for china ... not the USA.So mine didn't come with the ability to do some stuff (wifi calling for example) that you would expect from a new phone.The phone itself is awesome.I have large hands and its just a little too big to use with one hand for me which is its only drawback.Most normal people would use it with 2 hands but I have to be different.The picture quality is great even when capturing action shots (tried to sneak a pic of my girlfriend but she moved and I made an ugly face for half a second... the picture is so clear its like we planned for her to do that face for the picture).It works with the Samsung Qi Certified Fast Charge Wireless Charging Convertible Stand/Pad and does fast charge on it.Coming from an iPhone 4 this thing is night and day difference but I bet you could say that about any new phone.When Iopen apps they open immediately.Browsing the web and watching youtube videos is smooth and uninterrupted... On my old iPhone the youtube app would lock up after an hour or so of use.Plus I can download apps again LOL!My old phone was so old it wouldnt get ios updates and its level of ios isnt supported by ANYTHING so I couldnt even get my email with it anymore!I did discover one thing that I don't like about it over the iPhone.... You cant turn off apps from being able to use mobile data in the foreground (you can turn off background usage).So if you are on data and you open up youtube or 9gag and start using it its using your data.On an iPhone if you go into your cellular data section of your settings and turn an app off it will not be allowed to ever use any mobile data unless you go back in and turn that back on.REALLY saves you from using data when you have a wifi connection available but not connected for whatever reason and you start browsing the web.",2018年10月15日 在美国审核

Great until the USB Port Stopped Working,"4 major issues with this phone, and I think maybe other wireless charging phones have this problem too.There is no port cover to keep dirt from getting into the USB port. But if you wirelessly charge, it will build up dirt because you never plug it in to charge. Less than a year into ownership, the USB port stopped working entirely.Also there are basically NO good cases for this phone (because of the curved screen, nothing will stick to this phone for long). I tried 4 different cases and screen protectors before I finally settled on an all in one case screen protector combo, but the clear film used to protect the screen SCRATCHES easily.Finally, this phone's last major issue is the BIXBY button. PLEASE let us program this to open any app... we don't need your silly Bixby, Ok Google has us covered. One AI assistant is perfectly fine. Why would I need to take a picture of something I can just search for or talk into the phone and say?PS not a fan of the curved screen... def considering maybe Google Pixel next time...",2019年10月11日 在美国审核

"Arrived defective; one drop voided the warranty, so I was screwed","It's clear now that mine arrived defective. A problem started as intermittent and got worse: people couldn't hear me on speakerphone, and sometimes in handset mode too. I had a long call with tech support 3 months in, which ended in my hard-resetting the phone. The problem seemed to go away but didn't really. Then I dropped the phone getting a functional, and barely visible crack. I eventually confronted the problem again, calling tech support. I mentioned the crack and they said this would not impede repair under warranty. As instructed, I brought it to UfixIbreak, where I was told that a) the drop voided the warranty for all parts b) they would replace the broken part without also doing the screen even though I didn't need it done. So the cost for me was not zero but $340.<br>When my Korean car gets rear-ended, does that automatically void all the warranty on all the engine parts?I am livid and definitely won't buy a Samsung again.</br>",2019年1月13日 在美国审核

"Screen breaks easily - Otherwise, OK device. Bluetooth iffy.","Have had several Samsung devices, starting with the S2. Still have that device and it still works. Keep it as an emergency phone. Also have a Note 4, that still works, although the included software had not been updated so its functioning has been minimized. Samsung hardware has always been a reason why I purchased their phones. Dropped the others countless times with a case on and had no damage, even to the screen.<br>The S9 in black is the phone I chose. It was purchased during the amazon summer Prime Day event for the price of $349. I purchased two. One for my husband and one for myself. So we have had them for several months.The features and functions work well. It is a pretty device, even in black. The fingerprint reader works every time. The face recognition, not so much. I just don't use it. I purchased the unlocked versions. Wanted a Samsung phone that had 600 MHz. The S9s do. We have no problem with it working with our major carrier. The reception does not seem as good as the Note 4, even now when I use the Note 4. Bluetooth is dropped with the galaxy watches at a very close range (30 feet unobstructed). Is it the phone or is it the watch? I haven't tested the bluetooth on another device with the new Active 2 watch yet so cannot speak to that.About two weeks ago, my husband was getting out of our car. The car is low to the ground. He dropped the phone as he was still on the seat with the door open. It dropped from less than 2 feet above the ground. It was in a cover that protects the back and overlapped the edges of the phone. The screen cracked all the way across about an inch down from the top. I was there when it happened. The cost to replace the screen would be nearly as much as we paid for the device ($299). All we could do was be grateful that I didn't pay $700 for the phone.It is still my regular phone. I just like androids. The S9 works with the Dex Stations. I use that feature regularly. It was one other reason I wanted an S9. It attaches to a monitor and you just put your phone in the station and it opens up Dex on your computer monitor. I hate texting so when at my desk, it is very convenient to attach a keyboard and mouse so I can type out my texts. I can also use it to look at the apps and watch faces on a larger monitor. Great feature. Plus amazon has the Dex Stations refurbished for a great price.Now we just don't want to buy another Samsung device and most certainly not a new one, knowing how easily the screens crack from such a short distance, even with a case. So, I am most grateful that amazon had them on Prime day.The fact that it cracks so easily is a deal killer for a device that is that expensive new. It is disappointing because I had planned on getting a Note 10 as it has a stylus and handwriting texts is really cool.Now that I know they will break this easily and that is very different from our prior Samsung devices, I am really bummed out. In contrast, I dropped my apple 6S Plus onto rocks while walking with it, at about 3 feet above the ground when dropped, and the screen had a couple of tiny nicks in it. They were barely visible. The S9 should not have broke from less than 2 feet above the ground.I would only recommend this device if you paid under $300 for it, new.</br>",2020年3月4日 在美国审核

"Good Phone, But Better Without The ""Edge"" Feature","When I first bought this phone, I was a little perturbed.

No need to clear out old apps or photos or videos. Runs fast with no issues. And even if you did start to have a problem, there's a built in system optimizer so you don't have to download an app that's actually going to make it worse.The only issue I have is with the ""Edge"" feature.

"Great upgrade as a phone, poor blotchy photo quality albeit brighter low light pics","I bought this phone thinking that it would be better than my current S6 Edge - and just about in every way it is specially low light shots, but disappointed with the picture AI results in general.I normally use my phone as a camera, less so as a computer or streaming device.Sure wide shots look indiscernible, but once you want to see some details the S9+ images become murky at 100% zoom as the Auto settings normally changes to F1.5 (no you cannot force it to use F2.4 in auto mode - which most users use)Fonts looks blotchy upon closer inspection.Yes I understand you can set it to Pro mode so you can do this, but most times I use my phone to take pictures within 3 secs, no time for fiddling with settings.The S6 has a 16M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 12M.The 9+ has a 12M native resolution at 4x3, so setting it to 16x9 reduces resolution to 9M.Quite possible this may be causing it, but I read the Pixel has the same resolution but takes better photos because of the AI implementation.I normally shoot at 16x9 size settings so it fills my monitor screen and FB uploads, and this is how I compared the shots.Aside from the uploaded picture, I have also compared outside scenes on both phones - and I do notice slightly murkier pictures with the S9+.In the DLSR world, sometimes you get bad lens so the logical thing is to replace the lens for a sharper one, but not everyone has this luxury with a phone specially if you are at a mobile carrier store with strict use limits.I did a little research and found forums where people complain of the image quality as well, so I don't think I'm in the minority.",2019年1月20日 在美国审核

Some good &amp; bad,"Before I start I need to say that I came from a Windows 10 phone and a flawless working mobile platform. However, after a long time using Windows phone it's clear that a Android phone is quite a shock, because everything is on your shoulders to get it customized/optimized. Regardless of this, my biggest contra is on battery life. This is unbelievable, max 12-14hr if you use WIFI, this is not top. My last Alcatel Idol 4s Windows phone last forever comparing to Samsung Galaxy S9+. The good thing is, you can customize and make it more ""Microsoft like"", Microsoft applications including Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you can personalize the device with Microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave. The design is nice, the camera pretty awesome, took some test photo's and they look great. To install everything and import stuff such as text and/or MMS messages take time (and additional tools). Without customization the default installation made the phone super ""wordi"", just sending from every app messages etc. So, I recommend to check this first to fulfill your needs. The screen is stunning, clear picture. And it's good to see, Samsung is catching up with former Microsoft Hello technology to have fingerprint, iris, face recognition. Thats a very good feature which is also used in additional apps such as banking. I'm also concerned about IP68 (water protection) because there is no rubber seal protecting the sim and micro sd card from water. Bottom line: battery life is for me the absolute negative point, therefore 3 stars",2018年9月24日 在美国审核

Phone received 3 stars for basic issues, felt this phone would not last long.Pros:Great phone for upgrade from s7 edgeGreat camera, even at darkWorks flawlessly in the beginningWifi, bluetooth, wifi calling, all features and apps workGood battery life ( went about almost 2 nights without charging)Cons:-Heavy minor scratches on front screen (bought a case and tempered glass separately for protection)-Used phone - not reccommended unless your budget is tight, prefer refurbished-usb port charging did not stay in place, had to carefully set the phone down so it would not unplug, tried new charging cable and same results.-head phone jack - had to firmly push the headphone plug inside for device to detect plug (same issue without the case) but eventually works- finger print - looks like the first layer of coating was already half gone from excessive wear, was not sure if this would work but it was still able to read fingerprints and unlock phone with no problem (might be a problem in the future)- phone started experiencing slowing down after 2-3 weeks of using it (sync feature on, gps, browsing, online shopping, 5 e-mail accounts syncing, some video streaming, no gaming)Overall the renewed s9+ will be perfect for someone other than me.

Microphone stopped working after 60 days.,"I have always been a Samsung smartphone loyalist, but that ends now. It's nearly impossible to change theartery on the S9, therefore, I will need to buy an entirely new phone in the next year or two. But that's not why I'm giving this phone (and Samsung) one star. The microphone stopped working, so no one can hear me when Icall them. From what I have read, this is a major issue which Samsing has failed to address. I tried all fixes to no avail, to include restoring the phone to its factory settings. Very frustrating for an almost $800 phone, which is not a paperweight. Samsing needs to acknowledge and remedy this software glitch.",2018年7月29日 在美国审核
If I could return it I would,"Samsung makes the best displays on the market, and I love almost everything about this phone... except the display.The picture quality is excellent, but these curved edges and rounded display corners have got to go.Regarding the curved edges - they have no functional propose that couldn't be achieved with a flat screen.No matter how you hold the phone you'll get glare at one edges or the other.Images and text message the edge get distorted.On-screen buttons at the edge are problematic at best.The curved edges make it virtually impossible for a case to properly protect the phone if dropped.The rounded display corners are ridiculous.In many apps it really makes no difference, but in some there's just content you can't see.Ironically, the claimed display size of 5.8"" is measured as if the corners were not rounded.The fingerprint sensor placement is poor (though common).If the phone is face up on a table I must pick it up to unlock it (or position my face directly above the screen for other biometrics).Everything else is great: performance, responsiveness, display quality, battery life - all the things you'd normally expect from a flagship device.But these other bizarre design choices are baffling.",2018年11月24日 在美国审核

I did put an SD card in the other slot.My model number is SM-G9650. The phone was unlocked and new in box, as described. Took a bit for the carrier personnelto determine which sim card to use and they were a great help in activating the phone. Transfer of information from old phone to new one was very easy using smart switch. The first thing I had to do was switch language from Spanish to English. Apparently, since this is an unlocked phone, I am unable to set up voice mail. I learned this from you tube, but will double-check with carrier. Not sure yet about Bixby.11/1/2018:I visited my carrier and personnel was able to install my voice mail. Had to set it up ""the old way.""

Phone is good. But we have better phones in the market. Doesn’t have VoLTE feature.,"Phone is good as a whole.-Battery life is above average compared to the other phones in the market, battery tends to drain out quickly when you are using apps that use WQHD+ display.-Face detection or iris detection is pathetic. My sister has iPhoneX face detection is incomparable on these two devices.-Wireless charging: I bought Samsung wireless fast charging device but it takes almost twice the time it takes to charge through wire.-Camera: Rear camera is quite good actually even though it doesn’t have duel camera. But the front camera is just below normal for the phone range.-Performance: Been using this for five months now, no glitches so far. Updated to android 9, working smooth. I’m not much of a gamer, so I can’t really say how this works on heavy load. But for the specifications it has got we can expect a very good performance for my style of using which is mostly for videos, occasional photography and some social networking.- Bought it for use in India, this phone has not got VoLTE feature so, not able to use jio sim on it so sad that phone of this range doesn’t have a basic feature.",2019年5月31日 在美国审核

HOWEVER, I would gladly have paid more for a phone with no issues.I've received numerous error messages and quirks that lead me to believe this phone has been region locked or has an incompatible firmware.Software update: One of the first things I tried to do with this phone was downloading updates for it.When you navigate to Settings &gt; Software Update &gt; Download updates manually | The phone displays ""registering device"" and then ""processing failed.""Samsung Pay: When I try to open it says ""Access to Smasung Pay has been denied. Unauthorized modifications have been made to your device"" This means somehow the ""Knox Counter"" has been tripped on this device, which supposedly detects when someone roots it.The next time I tried to open it says Samsung Pay is not supported on this device.A SAMSUNG!Region: After experiencing these quirks I went to Settings &gt; About Phone | where i discovered the region is set to United Arab Emirates.Why would that be? The product even said United State Warranty in the description?Bixby:When I swipe left to Bixby Home, scrolling down to the news cards ""Newsroom"" ""youtube"" ""Yahoo"" etc... all display headlines in Chinese and take me to chinese websites.The language is set to english in phone and bixby settings.Samsung +: after experiencing much slower youtube speeds over mobile data than my previous S7 active, I downloaded Samsung+ to do a speed test.When I navigate to Samsung+ &gt; Diagnostic tools &gt; Connection Speed Test &gt; Mobile &gt; Start speed test | it says ""connected to AT&amp;T LTE Network, displays a ping reading for a few seconds, then says ""Test Cancelled"".Samsung Smart Switch: Samsung Smart switch will not recognize my device, saying it is incompatible.All of theses quirks lead me to beleive something is seriously defective or incompatible about my version of this phone.I can't download software updates.

It came with EVERYTHINGin the box as if you got it in store or factorydirect. I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't work when I switchedover to Verizon but it did! Bought through Amazon not a 3rd party. So far so good!MY ONLY COMPLAINTS and this is on Samsung's end: is the horrible battery life,the pre installed can't remove apps like Facebook and flipboard (idk why there isn't an option especially for fb)and the Bixby app/button. The battery life drains so quick. I'm not one who plays a ton of games let alone has 10+ apps that I installed/ transferred from my old phone so that being said...it's frustrating. What's also frustrating is the Bixby button/app and the Facebookapp. I can understand not beingable to uninstall the first one( it's annoyingwhen it pops up saying I haven't set it up yet or when I press the huge button on the side...why did it need to be so pronounced?)

Then suddenly, some 3rd party carrier ""blacklisted"" my phone, and I have been unable to connect to AT&amp;T, T-Mobile or Sprint networks since then.<br>Beware that in situations like this, Samsung will refuse to repair or replace because the phone was purchased at Amazon. Amazon will only replace within 30 days of purchase, otherwise you're on your own with a worthless phone.Avoid purchasing unlocked phones from Amazon. Instead, go straight to the manufacturers who all sell unlocked phones now. This way, you can have support after the warranty ends.Update: Amazon did eventually refund most of the value of the phone; however, the amount of effort necessary to get to this point, on the phone with the support teams for the carriers, Samsung and Amazon, going around and around made this an extremely painful experience and the time/effort was not worth the value of this phone.I've improved the rating to 3 stars because Amazon finally did the right thing.</br>",2019年11月7日 在美国审核

Had I know how bad the OLED burn in would be I'd not have agreed to pay 150 for the device.Honestly, with burn in being this bad being typical for this model I wouldn't have accepted one for free. I made my mistake and I'll suffer until I can afford to replace it. Don't make my mistake. Avoid OLED devices unless the screen has been replaced.

Coming from a Moto G5 Plus - I'm not very impressed,"A year ago, I went with a Moto G5 Plus with Amazon's special offers. That phone was great.

The battery life sucks on this phone! I find myself having to throw it on a charger otherwise it will barely make it through a full day. 2. The fingerprint scanner is garbage compared to the Moto.

CHECK REVIEW BELOW FOR UNLOCKED INFO,"****UPDATE 1/14/19****My original review for the phone is below. I have owned this for 1 month and found my phone would not update to the latest firmware, it kept saying it was up to date from July 2018 even though Samsungs website showed monthly updates. I contacted Samsung, provided the IMEI number for the phone and found it was factory locked to a specific carrier (not mine and NOT the one seller said it was unlocked for.) I contacted that carrier and found it was unpaid by the owner and would be locked until that person paid it off, the IMEI was held against the original owners social security number due to the unpaid balance and they told me to return the phone, the seller was committing a form of fraud by selling me that phone. I would ALWAYS suggest contacting Samsung with the IMEI number to verify it IS fully unlocked before putting all of your info into the new phone.***Original review****There are only 2-3 downfalls I have found with this phone and one related to the seller, I bought a refurbished phone and it still had the old phone number registered to it which is a fault on the seller, but also a caution to anyone buying refurbished.The other ""downfalls"" are related to the curved edge screen. It is impossible to find a case that protects the screen on all sides due to this. I have found multiple cases that are raised on the top and bottom keeping the screen off tabletops when face down however the sides are still exposed. The other is I can see a slight flicker on the sides if I turn the phone slightly, this may or may not be with every phone or just mine since it was refurbished.Now onto the good!The speaker quality feels like the phone is it's own handheld movie theater. The color is extraordinary. Battery life has been better than my previous s7 but not as good as I was expecting for a model 2 years newer and the plus version. Response time is impeccable. There is bass with the sound. No lagging whatsoever. Highly recommend the phone just note the curved edges are exposed and that part makes me nervous.",2018年12月9日 在美国审核

Take SIM out of old phone, put SIM in new phone...done. Attached old phone to new to transfer data. Some bloatware also transferred, but, as this is an unlocked phone, it was easy to uninstall (could not be done on old phone). A couple of people said the sound on their end was not as good as on old phone, a Motorola Droid Maxx. (One reporting it kept breaking up. Could be on their end).

Disappointing Knock Off Version,"Love the phone. The most disappointing things was finding out that Samsung's unlocked phones do not come with full Samsung features and capabilities. The Samsung video call and read text options are only 2 features missing that I have noticed so far. In addition to that Samsung does not disclose to you that you won't have all the features on your phone, until after you complain. Had the disclosed that information in their advertising, as well as Amazon, I would have never paid so much for a half functional phone. It's almost as if I purchased a knock off version. I've been a Samsung customer for over 10 yrs. This was my first time purchasing an unlocked phone, as well as buying online, and I will never do it again. Totally disappointed.",2019年9月7日 在美国审核

After calling Samsung and being given the run around about warranty, I finally find out that this phone was NOT brand new. Repair for the battery cost me $80 out of pocket.So technically, yes you DO save ~$200 buying new from say, Verizon in the end. However I cant speak for the quality or if this is a shady refurb.

Sincecouple of weeks ago, I have notice this flickering screen issues, is like the screen goes black and just a little frame on top.I have reset it multiple times and not good results and of course Amazon and Galaxy will not take any responsability on this.

Try again later.""2) Also, I purchased an AT&amp;T SIM card for the phone but I keep receiving a Sprint OMADM message:Activation not completed.Select to retry activation process.And when I attempt to complete it I receive an Activation Incomplete Internal Error (407) message so this phone was previously tied to Sprint.I am not happy with the inability to update the software or with this repeating activation message.",2020年1月31日 在美国审核

Has annoying green screen after 3 years of use,"Bought the fully unlocked version in Sept 2019. My Galaxy S9 works great for 3 years until recently. It keeps having the green screen issue. My screen turns green/black from time to time. The green screen error is popular among Samsung SMART phones, according to comments on the Samsung forum. Some research revealed that the issue is due to manufacturing defect of the ribbon connecting the touch screen and the motherboard. However, some cases are related to Android os updates. The Samsung customer service directed me to a local service station. After a brief diagnosis, the specialist onsite ruled out the possibility of any software bugs and charged $237 for a touch screen replacement.",2021年11月1日 在美国审核

Best upgrade I've ever made!,"Previously my phone was a Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime. I upgraded to the s9+ after about 4 years of use with the grand prime. This upgrade was worth it. My provider (Cricket Wireless) works with it and the picture, camera, and sound quality is phenomenal!! The best things that I like about it include the fingerprint scanner, the ability to shoot 4k video (limited to 5 minutes though), as well as the extensive amount of tools that can be utilized such as their network settings, the integration with google and samsung, and paired with a good screen protector and case, the durability. The only downside I could say is the battery through continuous usage.

"Bad color reproduction, overbearing knox","Can't complain about speed, it performs fine.Color reproduction from camera to screen is quite bad - looks like it's quite over-contrasted, and excessively brightened.Photos look vibrant, sure, but not correct, and a lot of detail can be lost.Sadly a step down from my prior phone in the dark, pictures are quite grainy (and again reproduction is bad), but it might not be bad compared to many other phones.The screen is rather prone to scratches.The curved aspect of the screen is really annoying - the only purpose it seems to serve is to increase the market for cases.All it does is make it easier for accidental touches.Doesn't help edge swipes, either.It does also increase the area of the phone that is extra fragile.Then there is the Knox stuff - that's basically malicious, given that it'll permanently damage the system if it so much as detects that the phone has been customized (rooted).Not trusting custom firmware while it is active is one thing, but even after restoring it to factory state, if it had ever been flagged, it will stay that way.I've got workarounds for some of these, and others don't impact me enough to change it now, but I'll be looking for a phone without these annoyances if possible next time I upgrade.",2019年8月14日 在美国审核

But, I truly believe in the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" The price I paid through Amazon was AT LEAST $50-100 US dollars cheaper than anywhere else.

Many apps are like this. The phone is just a DATA hoarder for samsung and Google, they are very very invasive in this phone.The worst part is the side button ""Bixby"" It opens the moment you press the side button ( like volume or lock) and regardless of what you are doing on your phone it WILL interrupt you and bring out that screen.The only way to change it, is to create a bixby account give them ALL your possible information ( surprised they do not ask for SSN) then you can change the button from one press to a double press for activation, AND THAT IS IT.You have to stay logged in giving all your date , location, etc.Buy a phone that allows you to use it the way you want it without doing every single attempt to gather your data.

Solid phone with issues.,"The Galaxy S8 Plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as I needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5.There are also major software problems too: the VPN simply refused to function after switched from Wi-Fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the VPN. My office has several Wi-Fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. Samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.Now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the S8, I don't even see the stuttering in the Google Play Store, that's how smooth the phone is.Overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with VPN according to Samsung, so I decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it.

I do like Samsung phones and once you've grown accustomed to a company's android interface it makes sense to stay with what is familiar.If you have an S7 or S8 there is probably no reason to upgrade to the S9 version unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket.In my case, one of my son's needed a phone so he got my old S7 and I treated myself to a new phone.",2018年5月13日 在美国审核

Samsung got a lot of things right so the few things they got wrong don't seem so bad,"My HTC M8 Developer's Edition died after five years, the S9 was as close as I could get to a acceptable replacement. It was better than I expected after completely disabling Bixby along with other annoying Samsung quirks.Samsung got a lot of things right so the few things they got wrong don't seem so bad.If they insist on a Bixby button then I suggest they move all left side buttons to the right and move the power button to the top.That will make holding the phone easier while reducing accidental Bixby intrusions.Cheers",2019年7月25日 在美国审核

"Probably the best phone I've ever had, except for one teeny tiny problem...","IT CAN BARELY MAKE A PHONE CALL.80% of the time I try calling someone, it's either mute on both ends or the call drops instantly. I have already tried the following to remedy the situation:* checked my cellular signal strength (I was outside and my carrier is excellent)* repositioned SIM card* restarted phone* reset network settings* disabled/enabled wifi calling* disabled/enabled data roaming/metering settings* cleared cache* factory reset phoneAny of these options at best got my calling working just fine for several minutes before it starts failing again. Sometimes it works just fine out of nowhere; it's simply random. After several contacts with Samsung's customer support representatives they referred me to my choice of a UBreakiFix location. Out of the 4 local areas only one dealt with in-warranty repairs, and that dealer then told me something along the lines of my phone being an ""overseas model"" and therefore did not have the capacity, at his store, to repair my phone. Finally, I speak with Resty (BIG thank you to Resty for being very helpful and understanding) who then assures me my phone will be repaired at their center located in Texas, offering me free overnight shipping so that my phone returns to me as quickly as possible.""Why didn't you just return it?"" Because I did not have these issues within the first few hours of activating the phone and had already bought a screen protector + case for it so I can protect my $500+ phone. I only noticed the issue some days later.""So what? Just get a new one."" What good would that do? If there's any takeaway from this it's that even a new device with an issue that's well known for over a year can still lack reasonable support solutions.It's even more absurd for Samsung to have this listing on Amazon for a new phone with such a common problem and NO way to repair it locally (unless you live in Texas!) I'd highly suggest Samsung/Amazon take this listing down until a full inventory review is conducted to avoid needlessly pissing off a large percentage of customers for much more money. If these ""overseas"" models were not meant to be sold in the U.S., DON'T SELL THEM HERE, or at the very least post a disclaimer at the top of the listing!",2019年5月15日 在美国审核

Unsatisfied Customer - Review,"I got this Phone on Black Friday with Fancy price. I was hoping this will be a good choice but I think I made bad choice.Here are the reasons1. Phone Signal: The phone displays very bad signal with ATT provider. I thought it will be provider issue and talked to them. They said this model has issues.2. No WIFI Calling Option: This Model is not USA ATT Phone Variant so this is not compatible with WIFI Calling. WIFI calling helps when the Signal is almost No or very weak. We can connect to the WIFI and then use that to make calls. This is completely gone. I had NOTE-5 and it was having good signal and WIFI on same places.3. Calls dropping: Called the Provider and they said same. It is the model issue and not Sim card issue4. After all these hassles, called ATT and asked for replacement SIM and adding the replacement SIM did not help.These are all the reasons that I dont recommend this to others.

I owned an S7 that had the same issue, and was hoping that the S9 would have addressed that. I also owned an Iphone 7, that had flawless bluetooth performance. So, this is specific to Samsung issue. Samsung does not seem to care too much, since all those cases are poorly answered... with no solution. And remember: this has been going on since S7 (at least).. Samsung couldn't care less.

Not Really An Unlocked Phone!,"I purchased this phone last year and it worked fine. My carrier was us cellular. Recently, an update caused a problem that affected many S9's. I ended up having the mother board replaced. After that was done the phone became locked again and started displaying a contact sprint message. It was a new unlocked phone. It should not have any association to a carrier.I contacted sprint and they told me the phone was tied to another account and they couldn't unlock it for me.

When I first received it, I loved it - and this would be a very different review if I wrote it then. But I live in Europe and soon the problems started to show. No Samsung Pay - at all. I checked everywhere and no one has an answer on how to fix that. Then the camera started freezing. It wouldn't go from selfie to portrait nor from camera to gallery without needing a restart. I now just left Samsung's flagship shop in London to find out what to do. Turns out my ONLY choice is to send it back to America and hope for the best.

Compared to my last phone it's a dream come true,"Like the title says... I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though:Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet.If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it.(Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before.Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected.The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in.The price for the phone was about average.I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies.Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES.if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user.I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue.All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing.I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook.I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.",2018年3月21日 在美国审核

Flawed software - Wait for an update ... !,"After years of not using Samsung's top-of-the-food-chain devices, I finally gave it a shot with the S9 Plus. Unfortunately, I had to return the device next day.<br>THE GOOD:Samsung still has excellent built quality and clever features that make their devices unique. I especially fell in love with the DeX feature. Being able to turn your phone into a fully functioning desktop computer is just cool and amazing. I first got introduced to this kind of feature on a Huawei Mate 10 Pro (which I also had to return for other reasons). Once I actually got exposed to the DeX, I knew I wanted it in my life.Samsung's displays are just amazing and unrivaled! I doubt I have to say more. :)The camera was ok. For some reason, it didn't live up to the hype; at least not in my opinion. Compared to my Pixel 2 XL pictures, the ones taken with the Samsung were way too bright, sometimes over exposed, looked rather soft and lacked depth / details. In this days and age, that's nitpicking, I know. All top tier phones take great pictures. It doesn't matter which phone you get, every single one of them will take great pictures while letting you down in one or another department.THE ""DOESN'T MATTER MUCH BUT STILL ANNOYING"":Samsung's launcher (user interface) has improved a lot. I still don't really care for it but I could at least have lived with it. I hate how all the settings have been moved around and how you have to search for them in spots where you would never have expected them. For instance WiFi Calling. Why is that in the settings of the phone app rather than under Network and Connectivity?Pre-installed apps are just as annoying today as they were a few years back. Granted, this days, it isn't as much as it used to be but why not making them uninstallable rather than baking them into the OS? I know I can disable an app, however, I would prefer if it isn't there in the first place!Samsung's need to duplicate virtually all and any of Google's services is, in my opinion, a waste of resources and it doesn't make their platform more attractive. Why do I need a Samsung Clock app that doesn't do any more than the default Android Clock app? Why do I need a Samsung Phone app where the default Android Phone app is just fine? Same goes for Samsung Mail, Samsung Calendar and a bunch more. If I could at least remove them and replace them with the stock Android apps, I would be more inclined to buy a Samsung phone.Bixby is a whole other story! From the get-go, I had no intention of using Samsung's assistant. Yet, here she was, right in my face. I could deactivate her on the home screen, however, there was no way of deactivating the assistant entirely. I remembered that the Bixby button (which I hit multiple times already by accident) could be deactivated. Yeah, sure! You first have to create a Samsung account, then configure Bixby just to be able to finally click on a settings icon in Bixby and deactivate the hardware button. I don't know who thought of this nonsense!As mentioned, I would have been able to live with the above. Annoying (to me), yes, but I could live with it.THE BAD:The most important thing on the phone simply doesn't work right: network reception! I got 1 to 0 bars of mobile reception where every other phone in the house got at least 3. I constantly lost network. Researching this problem online, I learnt that this has been an issue with all of Samsung's high end devices since the Oreo update. The forums across the globe are filled with user complaints. The German Samsung forum, for example, has 59 pages of users complaining about network reception issues on the S8, S8+, Note 8, S9 and S9+. This has been going on since February, it seems. Users state that their phones were fine with Android 7.x but since the Oreo update, everything is a mess.Strangely, this also affects WiFi calling, too. I wasn't able to place a single call without either fading out conversations or mute calls. There are a gazillion sites out there claiming to have the fix for this issues but none of them actually work. Samsung has yet to acknowledge the problem. Instead, they blame your network provider and make you hard reset your device. If that doesn't help, they will offer you to exchange your brand new device with a refurbished one under warranty - at least that's what they offered me! In between, Samsung issued an update to improve network stability but, looking around in the web, that didn't seem to have solved the problem.Regardless, a phone that can't even do the basic task of being a phone is useless to me, so, I returned mine.</br>",2018年4月6日 在美国审核

Not for prime time yet! Needs improvement for accessability badly!,"I received this phone and out of the box, I felt it would be a hard phone to keep a hold of if your hands are damp. I also had some issues within the on screen keyboard. I did like the fact that you could tel the phone to play a notification tone while on a call. I also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.The phone also has some other things I just can't live with. The phone would play a notification tone whenever I would connect an Bluetooth keyboard and or a hard wired keyboard to it. I couldn't find a way to turn that off. I contacted Samsung and they told me that is just the way the phone works and there wasn't a way to turn that off. US customer service from Samsung in my thoughts is lacking at best.I also got the Notification tones when I turned on/off the Voice Assistant for blind people to use the phone. Thhen on top of that, when using the voice assistant, I couldn't get the caller ID to repete it would only say it once and that was it. I tried quite a few caller ID programs and none of them worked when using a Bluetooth headset to get the caller ID to speak every 5 seconds or so. Without a headset connected by Bluetooth, they worked.The finger commands for there voice assistant for the most part don't work while on a call. Example: if I'm not on a call with voice assistant running, I could triple tap with two fingers and get status information like for time, network, WiFi etc... While on a call it says nothing. Same way with a lot of the other commands they don't work.To me for a blind person, I would stay away from this phone as the way it currently is.",2018年6月18日 在美国审核

Lilac S9+ .... What a Beauty,"I purchased the lilac purple phone Sunday afternoon and it was delivered Monday morning. The phone was new, no damages as others have talked about , with all parts and accessories included like you would get if you purchased it from Samsung.com. I also chose the bundle which included a 128 GB mini SD card as well as a Fast Wireless Charger stand. The bundle was at no extra cost so the price was $839 plus tax. Great deal if you ask me.I am coming from a Samsung Note 8 and there are minor upgrades from the Note 8 but those minor upgrades was worth me buying the S9+ . The phone is snappy, the sound due to the dual speakers makes a world of a difference. The camera is better than my Note 8 and the AR emojis are fun. Once the Note 9 comes out, I will be sure to compare that against the S9+ but in the mean time, I will switch between this S9+ and my Note 8 as my daily driver.

Beautiful phone!,"My husband bought me this phone in the lilac purple color for my birthday,...it's gorgeous! I love the display and the infinity edge. For me this is a total upgrade from the S5 I've been using, I'm so glad I waited! Everything shows up bright and crystal clear. Even my email looks nicer!The emojis you make using the camera do turn out a bit creepy,...they look like you but not really. At my age I don't think this is something I see myself using too often in chat or messenger. It's fun for all of maybe 10 minutes.The camera is nice, the pictures come out clean and clear. However I do wish all the features were explained a bit more in the manualto make it easier to figure out. It's nice being able to scroll through the different modes with a swipe of your finger but the how-to's on using some of the different options would be nice if they were printed out in the manual for reference. I'm sure it would be easy enough to look on YouTube or Google,....Haha I suppose this is what happens when you go from an old phone and leap frog over a few generations and find yourself in the future. :pI'm not too crazy about Bixby though, there should be a way to reassign the button to something else and remove the app entirely if you choose. I also like my camera settings set so you say ""Smile"", ""Shoot,"" ""Cheese"", ""Record video"", or another trigger word,... but unless you completely turn off the voice for Bixbyyou can't use the voice command on the camera. One feature should not cancel out another,... maybe there will be a software update later on.Or maybe I have completely missed the setting somewhere and will bump into it somewhere after I've used it more?The speakers are excellent, music sounds great and phone calls come through very clear. Using speaker phone I actually had to turn call volume down, on my old phone it was hard to hear people talk and the mic didn't pick up very well either. Not the case here!I love this phone!It's a nice size, easy to hold, and looks great! It was also very easy to set up and after I played with it for awhile I found it simple to navigate with a few cool surprises thrown in for me to discover. Having read how similar this phone is to the S8 I can understand some people being annoyed at spending all their money and not really getting much more than they already had, but I did read before these were releasedthat they were similar and if I had an S8 I probably would not have bought this model. For the most part I still feel this is a great phone. I know for a fact I will have a great time taking pictures and videos of my kids and grandkids with it!*3/21/18-Added a few sample pictures,one is aclose up (approx.12"" away, begging dog wanted my lunch), another a couple inches away, and the others from about 15 feet. No filters just had the camera set to auto and let it do its thing. Pictures come out clear and so much nicer than from my other phone. I've been playing with the other features as well and results are great too.Using the volume button to snap a quick picture is convenient, it makes taking pictures with this size phone so much easier. I'll have a great time using this camera when the grand kids visit!The lock screen is a little annoying when you have to click the power button then do the swipe screen, but in a way it's useful, my old phone did all sorts of things on its own while tumbling aroundin my bag. The hidden home button and the power button are both quick and responsive, either one quickly wakes the phone up but the home button brings up the home screen if you press it when the screen is off. You can always change the time out settings so your screen doesn't click off as fast to give you more time, so not really a big deal for me.This is a fun phone to have. Battery life for me is great, I keep the display on bright because it's just so pretty. I also have the timeout screen set for 5 minutes. I just charge my phone once a day and I'm good to go!

"New, Worth it in 2020, November 2020 updates, One UI 2.5!","This phone is still very relevant in 2020.<br>Mine arrived new as stated, it was still in Android 9 and would not update to the current One UI 2.5 until a Tech advised me to insert a different network sim, working or not. I put in my friends Cricket SIM card, restarted the phone and once loaded ( be sure your connected to WiFi ), the phone started updating! After two updates I was on Android 10, One UI 2.5 and it runs like a charm. I then inserted my own SIM card back in the phone. The latest security update is November 2020. The S9 Samsung told me will continue to get security updates.The phone is beautiful and with 4gb of memory it’s snappy, solid experience. WiFi calling and Volte work but bare in mind these options are carrier specific, not your phone. I also entered the Developer menu and scaled back animations from 1.00 to x5 which speeds everything up. You can Google how to activate Developer menu. It’s easy to find and do. My other phone is an IPhone 8 Plus for work and the S9 is much faster, lighter to hold, better built. The phone came factory unlocked.As far as display protector it’s been a mixed bag with the S9 curved screen so I opted for a wallet style case that flips shut to protect the screen and gave up on all of the ones out there. The tempered glass ones either fit wrong or pop off eventually and very much interfere with the touch screen ability even if the sensitivity is turned way up. The floppy kind aren’t worth it, the Liquid shield apply ones will adhere and cure to your screen after about 2 days but though I’ve used one before on another device I don’t want to chance liquid getting into the speaker on the front of this S9. “ Going naked” as we say with a folder or wallet style case works.Battery life with just web browsing, calls, texting, some social media, an occasional game for 15-20 minutes I had no trouble getting through most of the day. Mine starts at 5am and I would pop my S9 on a cord charger about 4pm with about 58% battery. I will also add I run the “Greenify app” from the Google store on my phone which further saves battery, it’s a well known app. The fingerprint reader, Face ID all work fast. The Samsung theming gives you plenty of free and paid options for your needs or you can use a different launcher. I love the Samsung theming but decided to forgo that service as I did notice on the S9 once I activated it it leeched my battery, so I stay logged out of it and just change my wallpaper. The Amoled display is beautiful, I run dark mode and love it.Camera is brilliant, has pro mode and automatic, night site. I’m a photographer by trade and fussy about phone camera. Sound, speaker, is also loud and clear.Connections all work, Dex (Android 10), Bluetooth no problem, Android auto, screen mirror to tv, it all just works. The S9 is still very worth it in 2020. Mine is the USA G960U version if your looking to fully unlock for rom development you will need an International version.I hope this helped!</br>",2020年12月27日 在美国审核

WHY)A few apps should have a bit more optimization when compared to iOSAR Animoji isn't as good as the iPhone X's version (I mean, idc; but some might lol)Face recognition is meh compared to the iPhone X'sCons:PRICE... This, and the iPhone 8 and X are too expensive... I still bought it, but still... (if you're tight on money, buy an S8 or different new good android phone. And if you're really tight, buy a good used S something or sort of recent iPhone)Fragile, had to buy a case and screen protector day oneLike 2 bloatware apps but you CAN remove them thankfullyOverall, I don't think I'll ever pay 800+ for a phone again even though I keep mine for three years before I replace; I'd rather do something better with that money. However, it's a damn good phone and I do recommend it if you keep your phones for a while or you're someone that needs the best phone every year. Compared to the X that some of my friends have, this phone is better imo. The X does do a few things better, but I still personally prefer the S9. Coming from an iPhone 5s, it's obviously a HUGE leap for me in terms of phones lol. If you're like me and want to try Android rather than going back to iOS, buy a good phone like this one (or the Huawai P20 PRO, One Six Plus, basically a good android phone) and you won't regret it. Will I stay with android and/or Samsung in three years? I don't know, but if things keep getting better as they are right now for android, I sure damn will. :)",2018年8月12日 在美国审核

Apple guy who switched to Samsung and will never go back!,"I have owned Apple products for over 10 years now and loved them at the beginning. I thought I would never switch to another product, but with the increasing price and little new innovation on the new products I decided to try a new product. I came across Samsung and after much research I decided to try them out. I got the Galaxy S9 and all I can say is WOW! The camera is amazing I can take high quality pictures and adjust the lighting to fit the background, the battery life lasts forever I go 2 days minimum without having to charge it and I am on it constantly. The Face ID and fingerprint are great, I can even use the Face ID in pitch dark and it works! Storage is unbelievable I store over 7k pictures and still have room for apps and lots of contacts! Overall this is such a great phone I can honestly say I will never go back to Apple.",2018年11月20日 在美国审核
Now Galaxy S9+ is truly the flagship smartphone that has it all done properly,"iPhone user and totally converted after trying S9+. Bought EU model with Equinios processor, 256 GB internal memory and 400 GB SD card. I need it for shooting video and 656 GB of available memory I have finally no problem.Camera is to die for, love colors and depth, comparable to iPhone X, so iPhone lost its prevous advantage.Display is the best currently available on any smartphone. Samsung definitely leads the game here.Sounds is stereo with Dolby, what makes it way more pleasant than iPhoneX currently.In terms of speed, it is maybe because of software, I do not play games, but for everything else I feel that Galaxy S9+ is faster than iPhone. 6 GB RAM makes lot of sense, as well.It really feels like fast computer and going back to anything slower is painful.Fast charging and wireless fast charging are added bonuses, it takes few short hours and works perfect.At current price for global market models (2 SIM cards, faster processor, 256 GB memory) and I paid 930 $, it is way better proposition than iPhone X. It is much cheaper to pay 100% for the phone and pick some smarter plan than to buy on monthly plan. Do the math.Bottom line, as convert from Apple, I may witness that Galaxy is truly an achievement, design, quality, functionality and reliability. It is all there now.",2018年5月9日 在美国审核
Returned after a week because of Macbook Integration,"I decided to move to Android after 5+ years with Apple.

is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now ...,"I am thrilled so far.I have had this phone for only a week, so time will tell what longevity will hold for me.I can honestly say that if the phone I own now, is still 'acting' like the same phone 6-months or a year from now (in regards to not developing glitches/issues), that it will be the best phone I have ever owned.I have never and will never own an Iphone, and I have never been a samsung anything guy in the past either. I have never liked samsung electronics (always found them 'cheaper' than competitor products). My first samsung phone 20 years ago (flip phone) was complete rubbish. My Son's Galaxy 5 (or 6?) was a nightmare. THIS PHONE however, has won me over.- Reception - best.- App speed - best.- Battery - very good.- Glitchiness - none.- Voice quality - very good.- Visuals - outstanding.The ONLY thing NOT superior on this phone vs my last is sound. I have had HTC flagship phones inthe past couple of years and they are way ahead of their time with speaker/voice/sound quality. The bar was set very high with the HTC and I never expected the Galaxy to match it, nevermind beat it, BUT the Galaxy makes a valiant effort. I will miss that sound with my old phone, but if that is the only thing I have to sacrifice for an otherwise far superior phone, I can live with that.Only other concern I have is that the responsiveness to the screen, with or without a screen protector sometimes has me thinking it is not capturing my finger taps and swipes, but it is very minor (for now). I have read reviews where this has become a major issue for some so i will need to keep an eye out for that.I will post back after some time of using this phone to inform if it is still holding up to this gleaming review.I am on T-mobile with this phone as a point of reference.Lastly, I really wanted to buy an unbranded phone here from Amazon, but I had to buy from T-mobile because I have read that you cannot utilize the wifi calling feature with unbranded phones. While this is not a HUGE deal for me, it is a feature that while I don't use often, it would be a nice feature to have if I need it. That said, my biggest reason for wanting to buy an unbranded phone is to avoid bloatware, but honestly, this phone isn't too bad in that respect. Not that i have noticed thus far anyway.",2018年5月11日 在美国审核

Leaves virtually nothing to be desired!,"The screen is amazing, it takes better pictures than most point and shoot cameras, has amazing battery life, and the performance of the Snapdragon 845 blows almost all the competitors out of the water. The iris/face scanning works very quickly and is effective even through sunglasses for me (as long as they're not mirrored/reflective), and if you do need the fingerprint sensor Samsung finally put it in a natural, convenient location where you finger just kind of lands on it when you pick up or are holding the phone. Also, coming from an iPhone I can say Samsung Pay is by far the best mobile payment solution out there thanks to MST (magnetic secure transmission) which lets it work almost anywhere as it simulates a traditional magnetic card swipe rather than requiring stores to upgrade to NFC payment terminals.There are entire articles that do detailed reviews of phones, so I'll cut that review here as I have no complaints about the phone... possibly other than the Bixby button, but that can be remapped or disabled.",2018年8月24日 在美国审核

"Terrible, poorly designed phone","I wound up returning this phone. I HATED it. In no way did it justify it's cost. The Huawei Mate SE is much, much better. Granted, the screen quality isn't quite as good, nor is the camera. However, the software is better thought out and implemented and, as such, much more user oriented and modifiable. I used the S9+ for about a week and went back to the Mate SE. I was much, much happier until (lo and behold) I received an S9+ as a gift. Now I use the S9+ just so I won't hurt someone's feelings. Karma better remember this.<br>BTW, who was the idiot that placed the fingerprint sensor right underneath the camera lenses? You always wind up smudging them when you scan your print.The S9+ is one poorly designed phone.UPDATE : The hell with karma. I went back to the Huawei Mate SE. I can be nice for only so long.</br>",2018年4月30日 在美国审核
Not everyone is a fanboy,"Clearly I am not a Samsung fanboy. I purchased an S6 that I was unhappy with. The amount of ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software was incredible. The phone's performance was at best lackluster. I traded it in after a few months. Then the S9 came out with much fanfare and reviews that often put ahead of anything else. It's as bad or worse than the S6. Yes performance is way ahead, but the ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software is worse than ever.The touch screen seems ultra sensitive at the edge, but try touching in the middle. It's hit or miss, even with the sensitivity set to believe I have a screen protector which I don't. Opening the screen sometimes reveals the home page, sometimes it is some other random thing from an app. Then there's ""butt dials"" that I'm not sure are truly butt dials as I have had more in 3 months than I have had in in total over the last 3 years! While on that subject, I an be walking around with my phone in my pocket and it suddenly starts playing music. The local Verizon store has attempted to resolve many of these issues without success. They have offered to replace the phone, but the one that they sent me was ""refurbished"" and had many scratches on the screen-light but still scratches. I refused it. All this makes me wonder how the reviews could be so positive. Farewell Samsung.",2018年6月25日 在美国审核
Would recommend getting the S9.... S9 Plus if you're a camera buff,"Literally the best phone I've ever had, I loved it so much I decided to upgrade to the S9 Plus version. Here's my layman's review on both.PROs:- The night photos are where this phone shines, definitely able to get every detail possible in low lighting.- Battery life is massive with both phone: S9 has a 3000mAh / S9 Plus 3500mAh- Plenty of RAM: S9 has 4gigs/ S9 Plus 6gigs. Both perform very extremely well but 6 gigs worth of RAM seems like overkill as 4 gigs from the S9 suffice with little to no slowdowns.-Headphone jack on both version. Also comes with some sweet AKG earbuds.- AR emoji is relatively fun and great to show to people interested in checking out the phone- Thin phone- 4k Video quality- Great Speakers- Samsung Pay, literally can be used anywhere that accepts Cards as it mimics the magnetic strip (Not like Google Pay that relies on the ereader).- Live Translations with Bixby Vision- (Plus Version)Live photo mode. Really great feature, and editable-(Plus version) 2 Rear Cameras with optical zoom at 2x and digital at 10x, and dual captureCONs:- While night photos are amazing, daytime photos can sometimes appear overly saturated.- There isn't a noticeable size difference between both phones.- What is the point of Bixby? Really difficult to incorporate it into my daily life without actively thinking ""I should give Bixby a try""- While thin, it's somewhat heavy.- Besides the camera, there isn't a massive difference between S9 and S9 Plus.VERDICT:As stated above, I love the S9 so much I upgraded to the Plus version. Both phones run extremely fast with little to no slowdown, even having several apps open does little to bog it's performance down. Photos look fantastic at especially at night with both versions. My only issue is the new Bixby button: it's not something I would actively use but at least users can disable this feature. Overall it's a lovely phone, S9 works just as well as the S9 Plus but lacking a few features with the camera.",2018年4月19日 在美国审核
The best phone I've ever owned. Should last me a few years.,"I made similar comments about the S8. This phone is a great upgrade from that. Two things stand out for me. One is the improved picture quality at night and the second is the size. I have big hands and I work on screens a lot so my eyes are easily tired. Having a bigger screen helps.This phone feels strong and robust in the hand. It has heft that speaks of its quality. The screen is amazing and I get great battery life that is easily two days if I use it sparingly. Used heavily it easily makes it to the end of a long day.What would I improve? For one a slightly bigger screen. Also make them more affordable. Having to fork out so much money for a phone seems ridiculous. OK its the best phone in the world but still.

There is a speaker on the bottom like usual but the speaker where you put your ear up to talk on the phone doubles as a media speaker for everything that is on your phone, not just calls.

A high quality phone with tons of useful features,"The Galaxy S9 is Samsung's 2018 flagship phone that currently runs on Android's latest version. This device is powered by Qualcomm's 2018 845 processor. There is a headphone jack and a USB C port that charges the phone from 0% to 100% in 1 hour and 45 min. The phone has 3 buttons: a power button, a volume control button, and Samsung Bixby (voice assistant) button. One of the biggest changes from the S8 is the camera. The S9+ has a dual camera that performs well in low light. Some of the camera modes include auto, video, hyperlapse, super slo-mo, and food. The camera produces amazing images and 4k 60 fps video. For unlocking the phone you can use a pin, password, pattern, fingerprint, iris, or face. The phone has wireless charging that allows you to lay the phone on a pad without plugging it in. The curved screen on this phone is phenomenal. One interesting inclusion to the phone is a heart rate monitor that is next to the camera. This can be used in the Samsung Health app. The phone is thin and light and has a great feel. Samsung has done a great job with the S9.

Almost flawless,"First let me say that most of the negative reviews I have read about this phone are from people complaining about samsung bloatware, too many notifications, or bixby. The people who are complaining about this dont know how to use the phone. First of all you can disable a lot of bloatware apps and for the ones that you cannot disable, you are able to hide those apps. For notifications, you can disable notifications for any apps that you choose. As for bixby, you can disable the bixby button as well as turn off bixby home if you dont like it. I honestly forgot that bixby was on this phone.Now that I've gotten that out of the way, over all this phone is amazing and truly premium. Touchwiz is fluid and intuitive. The fingerprint sensor has been moved to an ideal location, the speakers sound really cool with Dolby atmos. It's TRUE surround sound especially when you watch a video in landscape mode, the sound is really cool. The intelligent scan has worked great for me but I dont use it that much. I've had this phone for about 2 months now and it's still extremely fast and snappy. The overall interface is beautiful.My only negatives about this phone are in regards to the camera because I wish it had a dual lens rear camera like the s9+. Not sure why samsung didnt make this phone with the dual lenses. The camera is still good, but this would have been cool to have. My other complaint is the camera interface is a little bit odd and takes some getting used to.Overall it's a truly premium phone. Best android experience you can get in my opinion.

Dont buy from Samsung directly.,"I bought the S9 directly from Samsung.com, and wow was that a huge mistake.

I cant be without a phone, my business depends on me talking to clients. I asked them to send me a new one and ill return the defective one once i switch my service over. They refuse. I'm blown away. Had I bought the phone from Amazon, Best Buy or, hell, even Verizon, they would have given me that option. I tried talking to managers, I tried using chat, email, nothing works.The phone itself inst bad, but Samsung customer service is disgusting.

An S8 but better,"If you've already used or owned an S8, the S9 is going to be a very familiar device.Same-fish design, same glorious Samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. Dont expect a drastic change from the S8 going to this phone.However, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. The bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the S8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? Samsung's skin is still drastically different from Google's vision of Android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and I actually prefer the aesthetics of Samsung Experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android Oreo.Only downsides I can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. There's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. That might just be me though as I'm rockin' the phone naked. Curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me.Either way, the S9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon.EDIT: added more photos",2018年7月5日 在美国审核
Nice enough phone,"Wound up settling for an S9 after my first couple choices turned out to not be fully compatible with Ting's network partners. Phone is decently fast (I'm coming from a E4Plus so my standards are probably low). The curved glass is a nuisance. It seems to be impossible to find a screen protector with good reviews. Not happy with the case choices either. Have an otterbox defender right now but it doesn't come with any kind of screen protection thanks to the...curved screen. The edge pull out menu is too fiddly to bother with.Bixby is a fracking nuisance. You have to agree to Bixby sending off your data in order to get to the control panel to sort of turn it off (you can't actually turn it off but you can make it require a double press of the Bixby button before you trigger Clippy 2.0).Android Pie update worked well enough. Took 4 or 5 restarts between the security and galaxy app updates before and after and the 9.0 update itself. I figured it made sense to get the update out of the way since I was coming from 7.0 that way I only have to relearn android once. Apparently you can't change the icon shapes on Samsung's implementation of Pie without installing a new launcher. The new icons look pretty doofy.The Samsung Smart Switch data transfer failed using the supplied dongle and cord from my E4 (the app errored out on the Samsung) but worked fine via WiFi.Fingerprint reader works well, facial recognition much less so.Camera doesn't seem amazing but I haven't really played with it much. There's a pretty intense yellow cast to indoor shots. I haven't done any outdoor shots yet. It's surprisingly easy to get a booger hook in the way taking a photo given how tall this phone is.In my perfect world the phone would be a bit wider and shorter so it'd fit in a pocket better. This phone sticks out just as much as my old phone. I usually carry the phone in my shirt pocket and do a lot of bending and lifting at work so my E4Plus has taken a lot of tumbles (shout out to Supershieldz and Urban Armor for it emerging unscathed). Given how hard it is to protect this thing and how how pricey it is I have some trepidation.",2019年4月18日 在美国审核
Great for pictures,"I purchased an unlocked Samsung Galaxy 9 smartphone on Cyber Monday, 2018. I chose this phone over the Samsung Galaxy 9 + because I thought that the size would end up being too bulky, and the price difference was about $150.The slow-mo camera, water resistance up to 5 feet for 30 minutes, and dual aperture lens on the rear camera were the selling points for me and luckily both models had these features.I purchased this phone with the intention of using the camera heavily so I wanted something that could take clear and crisp photos that wouldn’t become obsolete and blurry after two years. The camera comes with ten different shooting modes on the rear camera and four selfie modes. Additionally, I frequently use the selfie filters and timer modes. Another fantastic, unpromoted feature of this phone is the indestructible front screen. Compared to previous smartphones that I have had like the Note and the Motorola Droid Razer, the screen has survived many drops on pavement and for that I salute you Samsung.First con of a few is the Bixby button. I appreciate the thought, but I would much rather just Google my questions. Next, the Samsung Note 5 has a screen size of 5.7 inches while the Samsung Galaxy 9 has 5.8 inches, but weirdly the Note 5 was bigger altogether. I constantly press multiple buttons when typing on the keyboard because the keys are squished together. Finally, when I purchased this phone, the camera was perfect and clear. Over the first month, I noticed a black spec in the lens that leaves a black shadow on every picture I take with the rear camera. It’s probably dust, but to get rid of it, I would have to replace the rear camera, as well as the glass backing because it has since shattered.",2020年4月9日 在美国审核
"Some advantages on the S7 and S6, but some technical-- and tech support- issues that need to be worked out","I got this as a replacement for two S7 Edges that I had to return. I figured it'd make sense to try for a fancy new phone, seeing as it has been many moons since I've had an actual brand new phone. I was deciding between this and the OnePlus 5, but this came with a bunch of free stuff and I have had major issues with getting support for products that aren't sold or supported by my wireless carrier, plus the OnePlus had a couple of weird compatibility issues that I wasn't as much of fan of.Pros and cons here:+ Amazing camera-- performs great in low light, much faster than previous models, and some fun new features.+ Fast processor. Fast fingerprint sensor and many more options for unlocking that I haven't tried yet.+ Much faster startup than S7 Edge.+ Excellent battery life. I can go through the whole day without worrying about running out of power, which is great, because now I have to buy all new freaking USB-C chargers, because capitalism.- Bixby is truly horrendous-- would rather not have anything at all than a built-in personal assistant that is completely useless, doesn't understand basic speech, and can't really do anything.

Made worse by the fact that Samsung has attempted to needlessly gamify the Bixby concept, so you get experience points when you talk to it.- Samsung tells me that the voice-to-text that they use in the Samsung keyboard is the same as the Bixby voice recognition, which is effectively useless. It misses every other word and mistranslates most words. I had very few issues with my S6, S7, or BlackBerry Q10 before that.- Fingerprint sensor is mildly frustrating on the back but you do get used to it.- Lack of a home key is sometimes unreliable for full-screen applications.- Some issues with unreliable full-screen/split-screen performance within specific software. I've had this issue only with YouTube and Google Maps, but it's frustrating.- Battery, while taking a long time to get to 5%, will die almost immediately as soon as it hits, say, 3 or 4%. I know this is a question of software rather than hardware as far as how they display it, but my S6 and S7 were much more accurate in terms of how much life was actually left. It is the difference between having to run to a charger to ensure that your phone doesn't turn off in the middle of doing something and, well, keeping it on.- Takes FOREVER to charge with the OEM charger-- a couple of hours to a full charge and no quick charging on the factory OEM charger. Sometimes won't charge at all with lower-ampacity chargers, which is an obnoxious design flaw of planned obsolescence slash idiocy.- Some software issues that I didn't have on the S7 and S6 including with Netflix, some radio streaming apps, Facebook, and odds and ends with a couple of other things. I'm used to these things taking several months to get resolved.- I've had some charging issues that no one, including Samsung, Amazon, or T-Mobile, will propose resolving other than to replace my device. This is the third replacement phone I've tried to get for my S6 Edge, whose battery life started to wane to the point of being totally unusable after a couple of years. It's extremely frustrating to deal with this.I will revise my review in another couple of months-- will see how it goes.",2018年8月1日 在美国审核
Iphone x Has Nothing on This,"I had an iphone X but I sold it for this. The iphone x was a huge disappointment. I used to buy nothing but apple products, but I realized how far behind apple is. This phone has a much larger display and higher quality than the x. Plus there is no annoying top notch at the top. The camera is better, I took pictures on both phones and the samsung was the only phone to pick up the fine print from a picture on my wall standing 12 ft away. The iphone x was blurry and the print wasn't legible. This phone has an incredible aperture to take crisp pictures even in low light. I don't believe its oversaturated, it all depends on what area of the screen you tap on and the phone will adjust the colors accordingly. Overall this phone probably has one of the best cameras on the market.The specs are good, you'll be able to multitask without any issues.The battery life is about average for me, it's not as much as I would like but it's not terrible either. I use my phone a lot for business, emails, video etc.. it gets me through the majority of my working hours around 7 hours of on screen time.Coming from an iphone user this is much better!",2018年4月14日 在美国审核

Like the competition; Bixby stinks,"This is a pretty good smartphone.The camera still struggles under low light conditions, but that's true of all smartphones.Beyond that, nice display, water resistant, it's not much different than any of the recent competitors,or even those one or two generations out of date.So, no 4 or 5 stars.If you own an S6 or equivalentthere really isn't five or six hundred dollars worth of difference here.It's not less money and doesn't do anything all that much better.It has two drawbacks.First, is Samsung's proprietary bloatware and manipulation of Android.For that reason alone, this is my last Samsung phone.Second, and really objectionable, is the worthless Bixby. It does nothing for the user.It is extremely limited in its ability to customize. It only gets about 10% of voice commands/requests correct.Google is far better.And, Samsung is so smitten by its worthless Bixby feature it installed a button just below the volume rocker to turn it on. It's very easy to press the stupid Bixby button while trying to change the volume.In short, who needs to upgrade?For what?A marginally better snapshot camera?A reliable (for a change) battery?For Bixby?I bought this phone because my S6 was just about done and I had to change phones to use Xfinity anyway. Unless you have to get a new phone, ask yourself,regardless of brand, do you really have nothing better to do with $500 to $1000+?",2019年2月12日 在美国审核

A very powerful and advanced phone....but not perfect....,"This is a great phone with a lot of cool features and a top-notch camera, but I could do without Bixby and the overwhelming number of useless apps on it.In addition, price-wise, it is not exponentially better (10X) than the BlackBerry Z10 that I switched over from and suffers from the following issues that take it down a notch:-Google Play doesn't download the album art if you transfer music over from your computer. It's not the end of the world, but the Z10 wasn't missing any album covers in its library.I downloaded a pay-for-play music player and pushed Google Play to the next page because I wanted whatever album art I could get.Without it, I find it kind of bland.-I am astounded as to why e-mails, phone calls and texts are all in different places. The S9+ should have a hub ""stream"", similar to the Z10.I found that I needed to download the BlackBerry Hub for Android feature because it provides the user with one stream of e-mails, phone calls and text messages.BlackBerry Hub for Android is the best thing since sliced bread and it is available either free (without ads for 30 days and with ads after that), and 99 cents a month (without ads), thereafter. From the human factors perspective, this is something that Samsung should be offering, especially at its advanced rate of development.-When a calendar event opens, there's no option to ""snooze"".-Playing music with earbuds was a little disappointing. The BlackBerry Z10 had a built-in optional booster and the sound quality was much better with richer bass, even with a $10 pair of earbuds.The S9+ DOES have very good speaker sound, though.I bought this phone because I thought it was time to upgrade to an Android-based device that could run more apps, especially from the proprietary BlackBerry O/S that is going or gone extinct.The S9+ is a very nice phone, but it is a little lacking and not flawless.I am one that will probably not use it to play Pokemon or for any gaming.The core features I use it for are phone, e-mail, music and some Android apps.It's nice having a phone that can do the latter, but it would also be nice to have the best of both worlds.",2018年5月21日 在美国审核
Very slim and sleek - read this,"I gave it 4 stars because there is no perfect phone, if there was they wouldn’t need to keep creating new models. I purchased mine elsewhere but exact same model and love the slim design. I’m comparing it with my present iPhone 7+. I’ve only had the Samsung 9 for 7 hrs but it’s definitely top quality. However, I paid $600 but got a $200 rebate from a little known and new website called invisible dot com.It gets better, their plan is unlimited and on Verizon, and truly unlimited, and no data threshold where it throttles down. It starts and stays at 5mbps the entire time period but it’s great for streaming HD and works as a hotspot.

The back of the phone can get marked up rather easily.The battery drains annoyingly quick, Even with battery saver options on. It's the biggest and only real flaw of the phone and I wish the battery saver options were a bit more open to allow you to pick and choose what you want to do.Overall, I enjoy the phone and if having a longer battery life is a must then I'd recommend getting the S9 Plus because the battery life is quite a bit better.

Not my ideal phone but it is good. Right out the box I had to make ...,"Came from a Huawei honor 8. I got this phone as a gift... I was looking to buy a one plus 6t or mate 10 pro when the prices come down... But hey I have an s9+ now... Not my ideal phone but it is good.Right out the box I had to make some adjustments. Deleted a slew of aps or moved them to a folder. Changed the always on display to not, because battery life is a thing I need. Phone case, yeah I got a clear one and a skin, because the downside to a phone like this is everyone has one and I don't want to advertise I have an s9+ for theft reasons. So I got it in purple because black is bi gender and purple is for girls and gays so there is less value in the black market if stolen. Got me a skin and a clear case and a film screen protector, because I don't plan on upgrading till 2020 when you know 98% screen phones will be a thing (like bro I don't need the NSA always looking at me with a front facing camera).So yeah. I mean the camera is awesome. It is literally why you get an s9+. You get an iPhone x if you are an idiot who is allergic to money and wants to blow $5000 on the app store and when your iPhone breaks you don't believe in repairing so you buy a new one, like that is cool dawg.So yeah the nice thing about having the best phone is repair shops can fix it if it gets busted so yeah.I wish this thing had an IR blaster because jacking control over devices is useful. Like my ac etc. But I have an honor 8 to use as an ac remotewhen I can't find it... So that is good. I shouldn't eat at restaurant that play CNN fake news anyway, so annoying, one lady kept turning back on the TV when I kept turning it off. Like wtf yo.So I guess I can live without an IR blaster.

The battery on these are a joke!!,"I've had this phone for a year and i'd rate it as a POS. The camera is nice, although the upgrades make is less user friendly every time it updates. The battery has been a problem on these from the get go. I've seen articles where Samsung tried to fix the problem with updates and mine has only got worse. Why make a smart phone that requires you to charge it 3 times a day. I use my phone in the morning checking social media, charge it for 40 min on the way to work. When i get to work i use it to text coworkers 3-4 times in the morning hours, and the same in the afternoon and i have to leave it at my desk midday to charge again. Get off work and i use the maps to check for traffic and its almost dead again by the time i get home. My girlfriend has a 9 plus and uses it as much as i do and she charges once a day. Finger print reader is a pain with a case. I have to rub my finger around to get it to accept. The back is glas, the screen is glass. Both broke from a 2ft drop. I've had Galaxy phones for a LONG time and i've never had one as junk as this thing. I don't like iphones at all until i got my work phone. Its a iphone X It works circles around this POS.

Amazing with some shortcomings.,So my review of this phone may be a bit different than others I have never heard of anyone else having the complaints I have with the most recent of the Samsung line up. With that said I will start with what I do like the S9 has the best camera I have ever used that is the single thing keeping me on Samsung currently. I also love everything software wise besides Bixby I always hit it by accident coming from the Lg G6 I am used to volume down being there. But here's my issue with it the screen curve away from the viewer annoys the crap out of me if i prop my phone up with its stand to watch videos the curved part usually gets a glare and it makes the phone far less easy to protect with the screen being way more open to contact on dropping it. I have decided when LG makes a new phone like the G7 maybe I will go back because I really enjoyed the flatter screens and the Lg setup was more appealing (No Bixby) but I will miss this amazing camera if LG slips up in that department.,2018年5月9日 在美国审核
"Good phone, but too expensive and elaborate for what I need.","I didn't see the point in spending this much money on a phone, when something a third of the price will make calls, have internet access etc. However, my good camera packed up at this time. After reading how good the camera is on the S9, I hoped to save replacing my good camera, and travel only with the S9.However, the reality is that the photos are still from a limited size camera with a very small lens. I consider the photos to be very good from something this small, however, they can't replace a reasonably good dedicated camera. It can take great shots in the right conditions, and I'm very impressed with the panoramic shots.The ""ok Google"" feature is good. Face recognition works well. I haven't figured out what Bixby is supposed to do. I have wireless charging, which us useful, and will hopefully mean there is no plug damage, and I should get a couple of decades life out of the phone. It's still a nuisance having to charge the phone every couple of days.Note, this is from someone who has never taken a selfie (and probably never will). I use it for internet and data so rarely that I have these normally turned off to preserve battery life.If I had my choice again, I'd have bought something much cheaper, along with a good travel camera.",2018年12月16日 在美国审核

"Phone was a lemon, but the Samsung Customer Service is an absolute, unbelievable DISASTER...","Samsung does not care about customer satisfaction. For them customer-centric culture is a very foreign idea.This is my experience. I will never buy Samsung electronic device again and will convince all my friends and family to avoid that trainwreck also.Bought this phone new in July 2018, at Best Buy. Phone started to act up couple months later, not taking up the charge, finally turning into a brick. And since then it was a road through hell of Samsung (questionable) quality and dealing with the worst customer service I have ever encountered... It is unbelievable, because I expected Samsung to be on par with Apple, but boy, am I disappointed!So - it has essentially been the following cycle: would not take charge -- repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - - repair (2 weeks) - would take charge for a day, then would not take charge - then I finally decided to call customer service again, but demanding refund, being fed up with this whole brand altogether. It's been quite a ride with those guys, too! It took them first a few days to reply, oh sorry, I take it back - to do nothing, then I called last Friday (12/07) demanding refund again. Then I was told 48 hrs for decision. Then nothing, so I called Wednesday, after 72 hours and was escalated to someone else who told me it is up to five days, so I need to wait until Friday 12/14 (today) and they'd call me with the decision. So I waited till Friday's late afternoon because - of course - nobody called, and after being elevated again, spending about 2 hr and demanding information, I was told the phone cannot be refunded, not even exchanged! Only repaired again (because they have policies that say that main board has to be replaced). Next week I was supposed to get this phone on an international trip. Now I am stranded without one, I just haven't got some $700's around to buy new phones anytime I feel for it.It is unbelievable that they have some unrealistic policies and it does not matter that phone breaks 4 times (the same thing) and they would not replace it, let alone refund it, cause ""it wasn't motherboard"". My communications with even 2nd level manager was just as that - pointless.

Honestly just glad that I am finally able to disable it completely, wished I didn't have to wait so soon. Hope to keep this phone in good condition so I can resell it down the road. Plus, I got a one year warranty as prescribed.Note: I bought from Amazon and NOT a third party seller. If you do then it's on you.

When it does that it gives complete access to everything on your phone if you accidently hit the button on the side or swipe left. and it can't be stopped according to Samsung customer service.This virus is bad, ""REAL BAD""unless of course you do not mind sharing all you phone numbers , emails , texts call history email addresses, photos , videos , etc.I love the phone it is the best camera I have seen, but the phone itself stinks, because of this virus.if you accidentally pick up the phone and press the button or swipe too far leftBang! the virus is back in 6 different places and all your personal data is accessible to the virus even though you spent the time to turnthe VIRUS off in the 6 places and remove permissions ,one little slip of the finger and the virus is back in full force.I have no Idea why Samsung would insist on accessing my personal information when I have tried to disable their virus software BIXBY , and it still propagates back on the phone.Samsung told me it is not a virus, what is the definition of a virus, my thoughts are , if it is something you can not stop from propagating in the OS , and It has full access to everything on your phone , and once deleted or deactivated propagates itself back on the phone, and again gives full access to you personal files and information to the Virus called ""BIXBY""",2019年1月3日 在美国审核
Easy switch from iPhone!!!,"While I have had several Samsung devices in the past - I spent the last few years with several different iPhone options.In addition to the step price and ear buds priced separately, I am much more of a fan of Amazon apps / products and my feeling was these would adapt better to Android products.I am so thrilled I took the leap to make this change - and here is a list why:1.Super high quality phone - with simple set up.2.AMAZING camera with loads of different features.3.Dual sim - so enjoy BOTH work and personal number on the same device.4.DUAL WHATSAPP!!!5.Seamless integration for all Amazon apps (photos, shopping, music, Kindle, and Audible).Same was not true ot iPhone products.6.I have been duped by Apple to some degree - H have invested thousands in TV and movies through iTunes - hoping that one day they make these available on other devices, but happy that purchases through Google or Amazon will be should I move back to Apple in the future.7.Can't beat the price - was able to trade in an old phone and saved $200!!It is hard to say what the future holds but I am quite happy to be back with Samsung for now!!",2018年4月8日 在美国审核

Fingerprints Stick In Screen,"I got my phone from Verizon, but I am reviewing it here since it is the same phone. The Samsung Galaxy S9 is overall a great quality phone. Sometimes I won't get a notification for text messages and I have some problems with the screen. I got a screen protector for this phone and I found that it lifted up on the sides due to the curved screen. This caused dirt to get under it and the screen has a hard time processing touch through a screen protector. I took that off and now my fingerprints get ALL OVER the screen. More than normal. That would be fine if I could wipe them off, but they stick into the screen. (I never touch my phone before washing my hands after eating if that helps) No matter how hard I wipe (with a glasses cleaning cloth) they won't come out. Everything else about the phone is outstanding though and greatly surpasses the competition. Even with these problems it is a way better option than the iPhone X. Better camera and battery life!",2019年5月2日 在美国审核

DON'T BUY!!!,"Don't buy!!Two things are good... the touted good camera and processor speed. Sound is marginal and maybe worse than previous issues.It is NARROW, terribly so such that 1/3 of my time is spent correcting misspelled words no matter what keyboard I try. Yes typing on the horizontal position is ok, but awkward and you have to use 2 hands. Samsung dropped individual text notices and so now EVERYTHING sounds the same when notified making you pull out the phone, unlock it, then find out what the notice was for... drivel!! At least weekly I have to restart the phone for the dail numbers to work, otherwise it does not put calls and texts through. The screen touch is over desensitized with a screen protector sometimes requiring multi-touches to respond even when in the sensitive mode.It reminds me of Microsoft's Mellium PC format.",2018年12月29日 在美国审核
Do not buy if using T-Mobile,"Do NOT buy an S9 if you use T-Mo and plan to go overseas.

The s5 as it received updates it would run slower and the battery life would barely last 4 hours after 1 year. I have now had my s9 for 4 months and it is starting to go down the same path. The worse part is I try to refuse the updates but now Samsung forces them upon you. I contacted them for help and all they said was we recommend you do them and then nothing more. I bought an Android because I thought I would have freedom of software use and to refuse updates, that is no longer the case.

The second problem is that, we are in 2018 and I still don't get it why Samsung still hasn't added the "" Screen turns on by notification"" feature yet when 99% of the phones today have this feature.

Hardware is amazing. Software is literally the worst.,Samsung makes amazing phones. No doubt. The build is awesome. The software is abysmal. There's so much bloatware andall you can do is disable it not uninstall it.This is a common issue but I shelled out 900 dollars for a phone and Samsung has the nerve to tell me what I'm allowed to uninstall from it?! Bixby is terrible. Awful. Trash. And yet I have a button for it that I can't remap. Guess what I can do?disable it. Yup. A dead button is better to Samsung than a button I can use on my almost $1k phone. The update speed is one of the worst of any brand of Android phone manufacturers. I switched carriers so I don't get OTA updates. I was told that Samsung switch would work. So no big deal right? It doesn't. It says my phones are up to date and it's 2 months behind in security patches. My S7 active was on nougat when oreo was out and it said I was up to date. Samsung's solution? Visit a Best buy store every month to get the update. GTFO.The hardware is awesome. Wonderful camera. Amazing screen. Long lasting battery. But that software is trash.

"Battery life isn't as good! Great, fast phone nonetheless.","I love EVERYTHING about this phone, except for one thing. The BATTERY drains way faster than all my previous phones. I've used the iPhone X before to play Fortnite and the battery on the iPhone X didn't drain as fast as this phone does. It might be that Fortnite isn't optimized for android or something, I don't know. I've also played a lot of Asphalt 9 on this phone and the battery drains quickly too. I recommend getting this phone still, if you're not worried about the battery. This phone has a excellent camera, although the Google Pixel 2 XL excels in some areas. A nice feature about the camera is that you can change the aperture. The screen on this phone is the best! The screen is so beautiful and HQ! I took my iPhone 7 Plus out to compare and I just notice the ugly bezels on the iPhone screen. I don't think I can use phones with bezels again after using this amazing phone! The phone is very fast, of course with a Snapdragon 845, you can expect it to do anything. Runs Fortnite perfectly fine if you want this phone to play Fortnite. Multitasking is very easy.

The screen ruins the device,"Lets start with the positives. It's fast, its responsive, the camera is good, ample storage and USB-C. Also has a headphone jack which is sadly scarce in 2018Now the negatives. The biggest one is the rounded edges of the display (and the reason why I will probably be selling this phone). they make it impossible to hold the phone with one hand, as it will ALWAYS detect your palm as an imput and mess up the touch sensors. It also gives a warping effect for any video being watched, so the edges are always deformed. Also this screen scratches way too easy, I have only had it since April and the screen is already scratched to the point where its intrusive. Had a note 5 since launch day and it had not a single scratch on the screen, vs this which was getting scratches within a few days of getting it.Now lets talk about bixby and the bixby button. Bixby is a waste of space, as the original siri worked better. Not to mention google assistant also is on the device, which works a lot better. Now when I tried to bind google assistant to the bixby button, but this is the next issue, you can't remap the DEDICATED HARDWARE BUTTON. I thought samsung would of learned from the S8 reviews, but I guess they didn't. Don't worry, they made it to where you're able to ""disable the bixby button"" where basically it puts it on a 3 second press rather than a tap, and otherwise remains active.Now for just some things that don't classify as ""negatives"" but I just personally don't like. The 18:9 or properly called 2:1 just seems weird, and it pushes the top buttons a little too high for convenient use I have decently large hands but still finding myself straining my thumb to hit drop down menus or open notifications. Also 99% of video content is 16:9 or 21:9, making 18:9 weird for bothI also prefer the dedicated hardware buttons of the older galaxies, as you either hide them, which means in order to have a home button you need to swipe up. It is always popping up rather than having me scroll when I swipe up, which gets incredibly annoying extremely quickly. The other option is to lock the buttons to the screen, which just makes no sense, as not only do you waste battery powering them (since they are white with a light gray background), but you also get burn-in since its an oled display. Also at that point whats the point in onscreen buttons, you could just have physical buttons that work better and allow front fingerprint scanners.All in all there are some very strong positives about the phone, but they get completely outweighed by the negatives imo.",2018年8月7日 在美国审核
Poor quality for price.,"This is, by far, the worst phone I have every used. Samsung bloatware eats up half your storage so that 64G you're buying is 32G when you actually buy it. The phone requires a case for protection so, just buy that when you buy the phone.Protect the screen. Camera isn't any better than less expensive phones and my Moto X4 had twice the camera quality at half the price. Battery will begin to fail within a year. Phone may or may not have gorrila glass 5.

... upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week,"Recently upgraded from the S7 to the S9+ and I'm terribly disappointed. Last week, I decided to upgrade from a Samsung S7 to a Samsung S9+. I even went all in with the BOGO deal from Verizon and upgraded Junior at the same time.Rarely have I been so disappointed in a tech purchase! And Samsung, I hope you have people watching for this sort of post. I'll be RETURNING. THIS. PHONE. tomorrow. Major shortcomings include ""Bixby,"" microphone placement, and voice recognition.First, the ""Bixby"" personal assistant is a train wreck. I don't know who decided that an unholy union of the Yahoo! home page and Google Assistant was a good idea, but they seriously missed the mark. And it CAN'T. BE. DISABLED. Nothing enrages me more than software bundles that can't be disabled.Second, you have to hold the phone in your hand to be able to talk on the speakerphone, or the microphone is muffled and useless. Seriously, Samsung?! the whole point of the speakerphone function is to be able to put the phone down.Thirdly--and this is the deal killer for me--the voice recognition for talk-to-text, voice dialing, and talk-to-email is just abysmal. These features worked nearly flawlessly on my S7, but on the S9+ I'm flying into daily rages over the garbled nonsense the phone ""hears"" when I talk to it. I have no accent and enunciate very clearly and it does no good. Even if I shout single words and go completely over the top on my enunciation, I can't send a single text message of the simplest imaginable words.

It’s at least as laggy as the last phone. It’s not worth the price, flagship or not. If you’re OS agnostic, get an iPhone. This is way more trouble than it’s worth. It arrives bloated and you can do nothing about it.Also, in typical Android fashion, you get a less and less responsive device as time goes on. Every app you install makes the phone that much slower. This is an Android problem, same thing happens on the Pixel 2 XL. I should have stuck with the Pixel which is uglier, but not full of bloat.It has a nice screen though, but I like the iPhone’s screen as much. This is hardly an upgrade, but another disappointment from Samsung. Maybe it’ll catch fire like the Note and I’ll be able to be rid of this phone.",2018年4月14日 在美国审核

Defective phone,"I had the S8 and screens were slipping and sliding/opening and closing.That was resolved either with an update or one of many calls to Verizon (don't recall.) Also lost audio at 2 1/2 years of owning.My boyfriend shot some compressed air into the audio part and I could hear much better. But I had already ordered the S9 since I didn't think we could fix the audio on the S8.I'm having so many issues with it.I was on the phone with Verizon for 6 hours yesterday - different techs. After exhaustive trouble shooting, it was determined that I got a defective phone!What are the odds?When I try to google, email or text, I get knocked out into home screen.Very frustrating to try 8x to complete a 6 line text.Perhaps it's that the screen is too sensitive. It's not the apps - we put it in Safe Mode.We changed everything around including Samsung keyboard to Gboard, thinking that was the problem - wasn't. I'm glad that nobody else got a defective phone who has given a review.Aren't I the lucky one?I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone.Wish me luck please!Thanks.",2018年3月22日 在美国审核
Completely broken notifications. Curved glass is a disaster. Excellent display.,"I am completely perplexed that this thing has such bad notifications.I use LG, Pixel and Iphone, saw it all, and had reasons to abandon Samsung long time ago. Every cheap LG just worked better than Samsung for me.Decided to try S9due it's small size; the only other option was Google Pixel but its display is just too bad. The only thing worse than the display are those large bezels, and the need to find and install some 3rd party apps that would allow to auto-hide the soft buttons, when you want to get more out of that abysmal display. Heck, except in Youtube, the buttons are alwaysthere, making that 5"" screen more like 4.5"", in a body that's wider than S9. What a nonsense..Anyway, S9 notifications:No notifications on locked screen:I have to take it, unlock, swipe down (needs both hands) and then I'll see notifications. Iphone/Pixel/nexus turns on the screen for a few seconds, I can see if it's anything interesting, if not I go with my work, the phone turns off the screen.Limited notifications on locked screen:Shows two lines vs full screen + scroll on iphone. Some settings available that don't help much. Androids in general are not that good as iphone, as they always are trying to bundle notifications. If you try to avoid that, at least they'll be bundled by the app.Raise to wakeup and show notifications:With iphone/Pixel/Nexus, I would pickup the phone and the accelerometar would wake up the phone, showingnotifications. As soon as I put the phone down the screen goes off. When I pickup S9 nothing happens - again unlock and swipe procedure...Notifications while using the phone:Some message comes in, the phone does NOTHING. Sometimes it vibrates, sometimes it sounds, and sometimes it does show the popup.All this regardless of Notification Sounds settings and Silent mode. WTF ?App Icon number:Not reliably cleared or set on Google Inbox, Outlook, Google Play, to name a few.Note: some of these problems are tied to Notification Sound being off. So, they tied together Sound and Visual part of the notification system. Maybe that's good, but it's them who tried to distinguish between Visual and Sound Notifications inSettings. Naturally, these certainly are two different things as their use model is different.Samsung knows that but they failed to get it right. It's understandable why they failed - read below about the SW update I got.Anyway, sometimes some things work for a while (e.g. after I change different options) but then get broken again. Classical Samsung...All in all, I am relying on my Pebble to show me notifications.Some 3rd party apps allow coping with most of these problems but they are unreliable, sometimes power hungry or not persistent. So why Samsung doesn't care ?Well, just two days into Preorder (I already got my phone) and I get Software Update with important bug fixes. So, these guys are trying to deliver the software with zillion options so naturally it's not yet ready and is full of bugs. They start lots of things, andrarely nail a single one.First crazy option: Edge screen Notifications. You got to check out that hopeless attempt to implement ... ...i don't know what.Second crazyoption: Turn On screensaver when screen is off. it's screen **saver** for a turned off screen ? WTF ?Third crazy option: Always on screen showing me the clock (duh) and that I have notifications... Sure I DO! I receive about hundred or more different notifications daily. The phone is ALWAYS in front of my face when working and driving - show me the notification, not an icon saying there's one...Fourth crazy option: You can enable vibration when you pickup the phone, if there was some notification. Duh, what about SHOWING that notification.I was thinking working hard getting different 3rd party apps until I fix the notifications to suit my needs. But still, that would leave me with the curved screen;Curved screen means there are no cases that allow comfortable grip as the case cannot extend fully above the LCD. I find much larger phones more comfortable in my hand - e.g. Samsung's own S8 Active, Pixel 2 XL with a proper case are easier to handle. So, my argument that I should get S9 because it's the smallest premium phone doesn't apply anymore.In addition, curved glass easily breaks as the glass is exposed. So many broken S8 phones around. I hear they've put much better **glass** into S9.Duh..And not to forget the screen protector - THERE ARE NO GOOD glass screen protectors on the market (yet). I don't know what's wrong but glass protectors requires you to increase the screen sensitivity in the phone settings. Well, that option doesn't work good. I type fast and often use my phone for work email. I can't go and repeat every other letter. Also, glass screen protector, as of today, don't cover the full screen. In fact, they have some glue on the sides for the better grip, actually covering the whole curved edge.All in all, I am returning this one, and will wait to see what LG G7 will look like. Otherwise, will wait for Pixel 3. Until then, iphone 7, with all it's problems, is still a better deal for me than S9.Some notable positive sides:Samsung Internet browser is just awesome.LCD is excellent. Even better after Apple forcefully reduced the LCD brightness on iphone 7-,to ""help"" aged batteries. Don't know about iphone X, should be also close to 700nits like this one.Starting camera with double click to Power button.Photos *with flash* in dim conditions are ages ahead of the iphone.Home button is there - just press glass a bit harder.Speakerphone is much louder than Iphone 7.---------------------------------------------------------UPDATE on screen wake-up on Notification:Googled a bit to see what can be done. Apparently, people mention that Samsung differs from IOS and stock Android in that you should depend on Edge light, LED light, vibration, sound, but not screen wake-up. So, Samsung tried to be more clever than Google or Apple. Lets see if they succeeded; I google a bit more and there are posts going back to 2015 about different issues:1. Some people actuallyLIKE that there are no screen wakeup on Notifications. But their screen is WAKING UP ! S6, S7, S8, S9. People suggested lots of thing but nothing helped those poor souls.2. Some people are like me and would want notification - just can't get them.3. Some people argue why would somebody want to be in Group 2. Duh, what a bunch of schmucks - that should be a configurable option, to satisfy both groups, and no discussion needed.3. Some screenshots show a very promising option in the security settings- ""Wake Up screen on Notifications"". Well, that seems like it, except that I don't have such option.4. There are reports on all kind of apps that will screw up the notifications. While Googling, a Verizon help page for S9 came up, showing that the screen will not turn on when... Outlook is installed. Aaaargh. I need that one for work. Anyway, after removing it and after doing the factory reset its still the same for me.I am reducing this to one star due to so many bugs. Started with Notifications, but I don't know what else is there...",2018年3月18日 在美国审核

GREAT DEAL ON A BRAND NEW OLDER MODEL SAMSUNG GALAXY!,"Okay, it's not 5G and, in fact, is a two year-old model, but this Galaxy S9 does everything....and more....than I need it to do, and it still gets all the latest updates from Samsung. The phone was listed as ""like new"" but, it was, in fact, BRAND NEW, for all intents and purposes. The phone was delivered in pristine condition (not in its original packaging but without a single scratch on the front or back)) , and, although it was loaded with a U.S. Cellular branding, it was network unlocked and the rep at Boost Mobile told me that it's IMEI number indicated that the phone had never been activated! Yes, it took quite a bit of time to update the phone and then successfully migrate it to my current cell carrier and phone number, but, still, a great deal, as, after an introductory credit from Amazon for opening a new card account with them, my net cost for the phone, including shipping, was $180.00, HUNDREDS less than the phone cost when new, and I did not need to make any commitments or enter into any kind of service contract to get the phone at his very reduced price. Yeah, it'll be considered an outdated antique in another year, but, hey, I DON'T CARE.

I have been amazed by the connectivity and accuracy of this phone. I have been up most of the peaks in the North, often in mist or drizzle, and this phone hasn’t lost signal once. Even in heavy forest, the signal remains strong and its got me out of tricky situations more than once. it’s also water resistant, although I use a case for added protection, and a waterproof case when necessary. That said, even in the waterproof case the signal remains strong. I can’t comment on its use for gaming because I don’t use it for that.

The phone is fine cosmetically as no physical wear was observed. This was such a great deal and she wanted this phone so badly but no disappointed after almost 2 weeks use!!! Would love for this to be resolved. Come on guys business has been too good over the years. It’s electronic which I understand that unforeseen issues may arise but all the joy I was getting from her now all complains and questions if I bought a renewed phone!!,2019年7月25日 在美国审核

Big upgrade,"I had an S4, but Verizon won't support it after 12/31/19, so had to find a replacement. I was plenty happy with the S4, but the S9 has been a great upgrade. I am not a phone person, meaning I don't live for the thing. It's just a tool. That said, I have been impressed by the S9's charging speed, battery life, and screen. It also is much faster at processing actions.Only thing I miss is the size of the phone; the S4 was just right. The S9 is too long, and for no good reason I can figure. The rolled edge-to-edge screen is a worthless gimmick as well. But what a beautiful screen...I got the S9 on an Amazon deal day of some sort, so the price was finally what I felt a phone is actually worth. My wife and kids have Apple products that cost more and do less.",2019年9月7日 在美国审核

Todas las malas reseas son de diferentes vendedores (para diferentes versiones del mismo S9, osease el azul, el plus, etc...), ya que todos los vendedores estan mezclados en el mismo producto en amazon.Las buenas todas son de Shop4you Mexico, a quienes yo tambien les compré y puedo atestiguar que si funciona con mi chip nacional de ATT Mexico.",2018年8月7日 在墨西哥审核

Mucho mas barato que en cualquier tienda de Mexico,"Decidí a reemplazar mi S6 por fin. No me arrepiento.A pesar de no ser una gran mejora sobre el S8, si que lo es sobre el S6 o S7 asi que si estas en las mismas condiciones que yo, te recomiendo el ""upgrade"".El teléfono es bastante rápido, al igual que el detector de huella dactilar para desbloquearlo. El botón de Bixby es bastante molesto al principio, yo he desactivado esa funcionalidad pues no le vi ningún beneficio. Utilizo mas Google Assistant asi que me vendría bien poder reprogramarlo para abrir este asistente. Lo molesto del botón es que al principio lo confundía mucho con el volumen del teléfono, se tarda un poco en acostumbrarse.Esta es la versión desbloqueada traída de EUA lo cual tiene ventajas y desventajas:Ventajas:- Version desbloqueada completamente libre de ""Bloatware"", como la que Telcel y otras empresas agregan a los teléfonos vendidos por ellos.- Actualizaciones disponibles directamente por Samsung. Mas rápido que el teléfono se actualice que si lo compras con Telcel.- Precio mucho menor que cualquier tienda en México, pues Amazon solo ""cobra"" la tarifa de importación directa sobre el precio en EUA. (En realidad la cobra la aduana de Mexico, pero Amazon hace el manejo del pago con cargo a ti)Desventajas:- Garantia valida en EUA solo.Sobre la desventaja solo puedo comentar que como quiera puedes regresar el producto al estilo Amazon, pero Amazon no te va a devolver la tarifa de importación, solo el valor del producto.Yo pensaba en comprar el teléfono en EUA directamente así que lo de la garantía no me importaba tanto. Además nunca tuve un problema con mi S6 así que espero sea igual con el S9.Recomiendo para protegerlo contra golpes la funda Spigen Neo Hybrid también vendida por Amazon.",2018年4月20日 在墨西哥审核

Be advised that you will not have the same plan options available with this phone as you would with other GoPhone's,"The primary reason that I have purchased several GoPhone's in the past is the existence of packages that are designed for people who use their phones very infrequently. For example, with other GoPhone's you can buy a plan for as little as $10 that will give you 100 minutes with 30 day expiration or a $25 package with 250 minutes with 90 days before expiration. The ""best"" plan with this phone for a light user is $25 for 250 minutes and ONE month expiration. Effectively, that is 3X the cost for the infrequent user compared to GoPhone plans available on other phones. If your use of cell phones is similar to my own, you will want to get a 3G smart phone that has the more flexible plans available. I paid $100 for a 3G Android GoPhone one year ago and it has worked well for me with expenditures of $100 per year for usage ($25 per 3 months x 4).",2014年1月25日 在美国审核

No crashes yet. Little slow, but can't complain considering how little it cost. Camera doesn't seem great but haven't played with it a lot.

Nice product for the price,"The only reason I bought this phone is I like Nokia products, and I am happy that it meets my expectations. The only drawback I found in this phone is the build quality, its screen as well as its back body. I think because of the sharp edges the screen is prone to breaking easily. Infact, the first Lumia 520 fell off my hand (from almost 2 feet height) and broke, there were large cracks on the screen, luckily Amazon replaced it with a new piece.It takes good pictures, the screen quality is good,touch is super sensitive, battery life is decent, Windows has sufficient apps.

Lumia lover but married to android after divorcing IOS,"As title says, initially I owned iphone for over 5 years. I owned all iphones except the first one. Last year, just for change, I sold iphone 5 and bought used lumia 900 cyan. It was a great change after owning iphone for years. I still remember the clear black display and glossy curved screen. Within 2 months I bought lumia 920 off eBay before release. I used it for 4 months and was very happy with everything except the weight. I usually keep my phone in upper shirt pocket ,so I always felt lumia 920s weight. This year I sold Lumia 920 and bought HTC One. Great Phone, great resolution, stable OS, great speaker etc.Recently in Amazon Deals I found lumia 520 for 79 dollars without contract. Amazon has made one click too easy. So without thinking I just clicked.I got the phone within one day.My notes on this phone:Stable OS. I love windows 8. Clean OS and a good change from ios and android. Once it gets good apps then I think It will be on top soon.Great looks and availability of swappable multi color back covers.Awesome battery life. It reminds me olden days. I always used the battery saver mode. I charged this phone 3 days ago and it has some 35% left. I have to admit I didn't use it more than an hour for past 3 days. But doing the same with my HTC One, the battery will be dead in just 1 day. May be non availability of LTE runs it longer.Screen is good but not great. Though the resolution is almost same as lumia 900 ,I feel lumia 900 screen is much better than this one.The PPI on this phone is more then lumia 900 but lumia 900 screen looked sharp.I never found pixels in lumia 900. In this phone certain colors clearly shows pixels. The color of screen does makes difference. Green colors show pixels more then blue.If you planning to cut SIM and use it then be careful. I think the thickness of regular SIMgives very tight fit on this phone. Though micro Sims slips very easily.Camera is not great. It's an average camera for basic photography.Price is unbeatable. Spend 3 dollars and its unlocked.I didnt feel there is any signal problem on this phone. You can hold any ways unlike iphone.Speaker is average. Sound is just enough.Voice is clear over conversation.Overall i recommend this phone for the low price.Can be a great secondary phone.",2013年8月23日 在美国审核

The operating system itself isn't terrible, but I'm not a fan. There aren't as many apps like the other operating systems, n some of the ""apps"" are just a link to the webpage so I uninstalled and just pinned the link so it was less space used on the phone. My complaints about the phone first off the side unlock button stopped working like maybe a month after I got it (if that). So since I have to either hold down the camera button n back out of it or plug in the phone just to wake it up, very annoying. Another thing is that the whole auto focus on the camera sucks I've had a handful of people try and take a photo and they can't because it comes out blurry.Also my phone did not come with a micro sd card, probably one of my first phones that didn't include at least a 1g. I wanted to give it one star but I have to give it 2 because it's pretty good at not dropping calls. Gets service everywhere regular AT&amp;T costumes get. Also as a testament to how bad this phone is my husband lost his phone and I suggested buying one of these as a temp replacement and he looked at me like I had 3 heads n said ""that hunk of junk, no thank you!""Oh and I can't believe I almost forgot, lately my phone as been shutting off randomly, sometimes it turns right back on and sometimes I have to plug it in to turn it on (because the lock button doubles as the power button).

Good Phone Especially for a GoPhone,"I will be fair and preface this by saying I'm typically a devout Samsung and/or Droid Market user; however, when I dropped my latest LG phone (shattering the screen), the Nokia Lumia was an inexpensive and suitable solution. The seller shipped the phone very quickly which was fantastic! Even though I had a micro SIM, I was able to put it in place well enough for it to work which is another plus. I actually like the ""tile"" idea and that it continuously updates my e-mails, messages, weather (etc) so I don't miss anything. Also, the GPS is just as good as any other phone I've had (maybe even better in some cases.) I also like that I don't have to call my voicemail because the name/date/time is listed along with the ability to play back the message like a regular audio recording. What are the downs? The biggest issue I have is that some of the free apps available on other markets (Words with Friends for example) aren't available or you have to pay for them. The graphics and qualities of the apps are pretty basic, too. All in all, I will eventually get a more upgraded phone, but I've got to give credit where it's due, and this phone will always remain my backup in a pinch.",2014年2月28日 在美国审核

Windows sucks,"The phone on itself is not bad but I decided to give only two stars because of the Windows processor. I had to get a new phone after I broke my android phone and until I get upgrade to a new phone. Going from android to Windows suck. Windows make the navigating through the phone app. Complicated. For example, one of your contact as several phone numbers, a facebook account and one or several email addresses and you end up with a list of numbers from which you have to choose from before you can send one call. If your contact has three different phone numbers (cell,home and work) you have to choose which one you want to call,off the list were the writing is very small. No direct fast call. And navigating to use other application is fastidious. Really not user friendly, unless you spend countless hours adjusting the settings. Also, lot of applications are not compatible with windows phone. I couldn't access my email provider because it is not the common provider. Bottom line, good for people who don't use the smartphone capabilities. Sound is good, cannot custom ringtones, even following instructions.

Excellent for the price,"I've had this phone since 7/26/13, the first day it went on sale.I purchased it from the AT&amp;T store, and I later purchased a second one on Amazon.I wanted to use the phone a good month before giving it a review.I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy S3, which I owned for about 7 months.Prior to that, I had an iPhone 3G.I also have my wife's iPhone 4 to compare to.I love the Android OS the best, but decided to sell the S3 because of a battery plummet issue that I could never get resolved other than a soft reset, and the miniUSB port went dead.I could not charge nor connect my phone to a computer (no rooting, no transfer of files, etc).Because I am anticipating some flagships Android phones to be announced soon, I've held off on buying another Android.I eventually plan to have an Android as my primary phone.I purchased the 520 as a transitional phone.WP8 has always intrigued me.I briefly thought about the Lumia 920 back in November when it came out, but I really like Android and it's integration with Chrome Browser.I use a lot of Chrome extensions that make it a pleasure to use with an Android phone.I am a Google fan and many apps are important to me.Google Voice, Tasks, Keep, Chrome to Phone, Gmail.During my day, I check email on my phone, text via Google Voice on my desktop Chrome browser.I also like youtube.I don't do much social media such as Facebook/Twitter.I'm not a gamer either.I rarely use navigation as my sense of direction is pretty good, and I don't drive into unfamiliar territory very often.GPS is not of great importance to me, but it's nice to have when I need it.Likes (in no particular order):- Price.What else can one get for $100 or less?- WP8 is smooth, fast, no lagging, responsive, and stable.I've had a couple random reboots when an app crashed (UC Browser)- FM radio!!! with Amber/GDR2 release.I enjoy listening to local talk radio.Also, in an emergency situation where the cell towers may be overloaded, an FM radio may be essential and the only way to get critical information.- Reasonable syncing with Google Contacts and Calendar- Size.Although I do like phablets and screens &gt; 4.7"", when I'm at work, it fits in my pocket.However, I do plan to get a larger phone.- Wifi and Bluetooth radios are excellent.The 80211.n wireless is very stable.No dropped connections.On Speedtest, I get up to 30 mps down and 4 mps up with Charter cable.The bluetooth reliably connects to my Hyundai's bluetooth with no issue for over a month.With my iPhone 3G, there were times that the phone would not connect, and I would get this annoying ""pairing failed"" message that would not stop.I would have to turn the bluetooth off on the phone, and reconnect.No so with the Lumia.No dropped connections.It pairs with my Windows Vista laptop, and can stream music, send and receive files easily.That is one feature missing on iPhones (being able to send/receive files via Bluetooth.Also pairs with my Plantronics 320 headset easily.- Supersensitive screen.I can use ferromagnetic objects to tap, scroll and swipe.- Easy drop and drag of music and ringtones by connecting the phone to a computer via the included USB data cable.I can easily add custom ringtones by dragging to the ringtones folder.- Decent mapping/navigation app.I like how Here Drive displays your speed and alerts you if you drive above a set limit.The GPS finds a signal quickly, better than my prior SG3.- Camera can be used while the phone is locked by pressing the dedicated camera button.- Battery life is decent.I charge the phone overnight, and at the end of the work day, it's often at about 60-70%.I check email, light browsing throught the day.I don't do much calling because my office does not get a good cell signal.I just had one incident of rapid battery drain for some unknown reason.It was at 24% at lunch (I didn't charge it overnight), andthen dead a couple hours later.I don't know how it happened.BTW, I have wifi/bluetooth always on, screen set on medium brightness, and double tap to wake disabled.- User replaceable battery and expandable memory via microSD card.- 4G (technically 3.5G with HSPA+) has been speedy enough for me, but I use wifi mostly.- Works with AT&amp;T postpaid.I popped the SIM in the phone, and got 4G/data right away.As I understand, it may work with other AT&amp;T MVNO's without unlocking.- AT&amp;T unlocked it for me!No problems.I called customer service, gave them my IMEI #, and in a little while, I was given the unlock code.I am a Premier Member and have been an AT&amp;T/Cingular customer for 11 years.- Customizable back covers.I plan on getting a red battery cover.Red looks sharp to me.Dislikes- Screen is a fingerprint magnet- App selection, for me, is poor.It's not Nokia's fault and I knew that prior to purchasing the phone.With time, I'm hoping that the selection will improve, and that Google will develop some more apps.Some of the 3rd party equivalents just aren't as good.For example, Goroovester is inferior to Google Play.I used multiple browsers on Android.I wish Flipboard and Google Current was available as I enjoy those.Banking apps such as USAA and VALIC have no WP8 apps.I probably could go to the mobile website.- App quality is often inferior to the Android equivalent.Skype, a Microsoft product, is better on Android than WP8, in my opinion.WTF???On Android, I can send files and images.WP8, absolutely not.Not a deal breaker, but Skype was purchased by MS.I do like to check traffic before going home, but Nokia Here maps don't often report traffic incidents and conditions as accurately as other platforms.I compared it to my wife's iPhone 4 (Apple maps and Google maps), which reported incidents that were absent on Nokia Here Maps.- No Adobe flash support.- No wireless file transfer (save bluetooth), but on Android, there's ES File Explorer and Airdrop.- Personal preference, but I'm not a huge file of the Tile look/GUI.I prefer icons and widgets as on Android.- Camera quality is OK, but not great.It serves its purpose for pics I use for eBay/Craigslist, and sending to family.I realize that this is an entry level phone.- No notification center (A WP8 issue more so than the the Lumia 520).I know that others have said that you can arrange the tiles so everything important is near the top.However, a notification would give all my important info at a quick glance.Besides, some of the live tiles do not update constantly, but rather every 30 minutes.- Lack of customization.On Android, I like being able to have individual email accounts give a notification sound and others silent.On WP8, that isn't possible.I hope that is something Microsoft will add in a future update.Also, I'd like to be able to have the volume set differently for specific apps rather than one master volume.Lack of a front facing camera, camera flash or NFC is not an issue for me as I didn't use it on my SG3.I miss my Android, but for the last 5+ weeks, I have been able to survive on WP8.The platform and app selection will likely improve as the Lumia 520/521 has probably added a lot of new WP8 users.I will keep the Lumia as my backup phone and media player once I get a new Android.Overall, this is a very nice phone, but as a Google user, it doesn't work for me as well.I think this is a great phone for new smartphone users.For basic functions, it covers all the bases well.",2013年9月2日 在美国审核

Not very satisfied... Android phones are way better,"I used to be a Nokia supporter and loyalist, but I have to say this phone is not up to my expectations. Most of the issues are with windows phone as opposed to Nokia, but it was Nokia's choice to go with windows mobile (as opposed to Android for example).Pros:1) Good phone with all basic features of a standard smart phone2) GPS capability even in offline mode (I have not tested this, and I don't use GPS for my driving. So this plus point is irrelevant to me)Cons:1) The contacts cannot be stored on the phone. The windows OS forces you to sync with one of the many online accounts such as hotmail, windows live, facebook, Nokia customer account etc. This is a BIG MINUS for me. As much as I understand the usefulness of such a feature, I believe Nokia (or windows) has no right to force that way of storing contacts on their customers. There are folks like me who don't want to keep our contacts in hotmail or other email accounts. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that I keep many many contacts in my email acccount like hotmail that includes my insurance agent, and other businesses I work with on a sporadic basis. I don't want all those showing up in my phone cluttering my contact list. If I have 150 contacts in my hotmail or google account, I probably call only 20 of them on a regular basis (or even occasional basis) - so I want to store only my essential contacts in my phone locally. Also I can't throw my office contacts in my hotmail account, and without an office server to connect to, and notbeing able to store my work colleagues locally on my phone, this is a real mess. I would give a rating of 1 just for this reason. I want to keep my contacts locally on my phone, and so far it has not been possible. This causes me a lot of trouble.2) Cramped keyboard buttons resulting in wrong typing more often than acceptable3) Very few apps in windows marketplace. Nowhere near Android.4) Camera quality is not great (but this doesn't matter tome too much).I don't care about GPS feature, I need a good smartphone that will allow me to keep my contacts stored locally, providing access to useful apps. This phone fails to provide me with that experience. The fault is mostly on windows mobile platform as opposed to Nokia - but at the end they are inseparable when it comes to end user experience.I switched from Android, and if I can go back in time, I would avoid purchasing this phone and stay with some Android device.",2014年7月9日 在美国审核

AT&amp;T don't provide cheap plans (the cheapest prepaid plan is $25 per month smart phone plan). Also it is hard to unlock this device work with non AT&amp;T SIM cards.If you are an existing AT&amp;T customer or your carrier uses AT&amp;T network (H2O wireless, Net10) you can buy this phone to use with your existing SIM card.

So, this should work alright."" Wrong! it is simply an infuriating operating system! I really really don't like it. Beside that, this phone tends to freeze up, just like a computer which is overloaded for its resources. And, it tends to dial itself, without me asking it to. On top of that, there are no waterproof protective cases, or any quality protective case, which will fit it.I thought I'd save money by purchasing a Nokia Lumia 500. Nope.

buy this phone if you need a good budget device,"I purchased this phone as a temporary replacement for my broken iphone4s over a year ago when the price was first starting to drop below $100. I dropped the nokia multiple times but once from my ear at 6' onto my slate flooring it broke, so i went online and bought another 520! the screen resolution isnt the greatest, but on a 4"" screen it is hardly noticable. OS allows you to move all downloaded apps over to your micro SD card (not included) which really helps with space on the internal memory. over all i am happy with my purchase, i did have an issue with the buttons not working after a while but i fixed them myself by sliding in a thin piece of plastic cut from a soda bottle just above each button to help it make contact when pressed. since then i have experianced no problems. ive noticed the phone lags if you install your apps to an SD card with a slow read/write ability so i recommend a class 10. another PRO is that since it is a windows phone you can control your pc from on the go thru a free app called TeamViewer. also, the HD video quality is better than i ever imagined from a 5mp device. i can play videos i've recorded to my 50"" tv with no pixelation!",2014年12月21日 在美国审核

I have given up and am ordering an android,"I thought ""oh, MS Windows, goody"" - because I am not that tech savvy, love Windows on my PC, and figured this would be easy to operate.Then, too, overall the reviews were really stellar on Amazon and elsewhere.Unfortunately, at least for me, it is not easy to use. It is a headache to figure out this OS (in contast to my Ipod Touch which has been a breeze to operate even though I was not previously familiar with any Apple OS).Figuring out how to enter contacts, and then finding them, is a pain.The button for the camera is hard to push and the touchscreen camera ""shutter"" takes forever to take a photo.The phone runs out of battery power quickly.This phone is heavy. In short, I loathe carrying it and forget to take it with me much more often than I have ever forgotten any other phone.I knew I did not like it very much when it arrived. I should have sent it back.When my new LG Android comes, I'll pay much closer attention to whether it is a keeper.",2014年2月24日 在美国审核

It's estimated to be at least 10 business days+round shipping time(overall about 3-4 weeks). They don't even provide loaner/replacement service.
