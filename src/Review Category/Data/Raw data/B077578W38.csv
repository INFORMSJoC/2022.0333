THIS PHONE WAS NOT PAYED OFF,"I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&amp;t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price)trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could",2019年4月17日 在美国审核
Exceeded Expectations,"I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream.

"Great Phone, Nearly Perfect","So before I made this purchase, I read through a lot of reviews on a lot of different sellers who had iPhone X's for sale. This one seemed to have the most consistent positive stream of reviews, although every single listing I came across had at least a few people reporting bad experiences. Buying something Amazon Renewed seems like it's always a risk, so I suppose you may have a bad experience, but the phone I received came on time, and was essentially in flawless condition. It came with a tempered glass screen protector already on, and the battery health was at 92%, supporting peak performance capabilities. The cameras are crisp, no damage to them at all, and the speakers sound great. No SIM/WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity issues whatsoever, and really I was pleasantly surprised at how great this phone is. The only thing was that in a couple of the crevices on the phone, chiefly around the camera's protrusion, there was a tiny bit of dirt/grime, but a toothpick and alcohol did the trick. Overall I would say this is a great purchase, as iPhone X's are currently going for $899+tax (new) from Best Buy, and this was almost new for $559+tax (~$611). Would recommend!",2019年11月7日 在美国审核

That is a shame. :( For those who question my knowledge, I took it directly to Verizon and they also tried multiple sim cards in it and none worked. The phone continued to display NO SERVICE.

Absolutely disgusted!!!!,"I purchased an iPhone X. The whole reason I made this purchase was because it was “Amazon guaranteed”. It arrived on a Thursday; Immediately when the phone arrived I noticed issues. Upon making my first call, the phone would turn off and the restart 5 or 6 times in a row, not even allowing me to access the Home Screen. So I called Amazon. I talked to Ryan E.A “customer support representative” at Amazon. Ryan gave three possible options1) bring the phone to an Apple store and they will either fix the problem or replace it,2) return the item with possible two week reimbursement.3) ship it to Apple and they would fix the problemI chose to set up an appointment at the Apple store to have the problem fixed.At which point Ryan E. Booked the appointment for me, over the phone, with an Apple representative as it was a Amazon guaranteed product. Tuesday I drove 200 miles away to the Apple store. The Apple representative performed a diagnostic and informed me the main processing chip was faulty and therefore the phone needed to be replaced and they even had the exact replacement in store. As Amazon had already verified everything would be taken care of cost wise, I called Amazon to provide a “geniusbar work authorization &amp; service confirmation” form for replacement as it would cost $549.00. Ashley C, who told me that they would not pay for the replacement and the only option for me was to return the product and get a refund. I then told Ashley exactly what Ryan told me. Ashley said I was wrong and that amazon did not set up an appointment for an apple store repair, and that I would need to prove the appointment was made by a representative of amazon. When I explained that I had email verification she then said ""I see the email"" then refused to follow through on replacement even though and told me that my only option was to return the phone or keep it upon bringing up what amazon had previously promised like magic I was disconnected. At that point since I had an appointment and I didn't want to take up anyone else's time; I decided to leave. When I got back to my car, I once again decided to call Amazon. This time while talking with the representative Ashley I was told that the phone I purchased was not amazon guaranteed, even though the actual iPhone X amazon listing specifically says ""Amazon Guaranteed; eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days"". Furthermore, Ashley told me that a return and refund is my only option I brought up that amazon listed the product under Amazon guaranteed specifically states ""Quick support for claims and troubleshooting. Eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied."" she continued by stating the product was not amazon guaranteed and stated that the listing is removed and they can't do anything further. When I asked to speak to a manager I was transferred to Sam G. who by the way was incredibly rude, and refused to help me in any way and refused to replace the product, or assist me with anything other that returning the iPhone. I am disgusted at the way this whole situation has been handled. Even after reviewing amazons guaranteed policy I still cannot find where it states amazon has the ability to refuse to follow through with their guaranteed product replacement. I do know that I will not only be bringing this up with the BBB but also the attorney general.",2021年1月20日 在美国审核

It was what I expect ,Now for the people who are reading this message it is important for you to know. if you want a really good offer for a really cheap price go ahead and take the chance Buy this iPhone. There’s no scam is the real deal. now note this you are buying a used iPhone. Second thing that you need to keep in mind Is the battery capacity if you’re looking for a phone you want to try to aim for 95% battery capacity is your best bet when I received mine I got it at 80% battery capacity so that’s also another thing to keep in mind when you’re buying a used phone make sure you’re looking at that battery capacity it’s really important another thing you will receive scratches on the display and the back glass in my opinion this is nothing to cry over just throw a case on it and it should look pretty good. you also want to make sure that your face recognition is on point make sure that everything on the phone is responsive after Unboxing thank you guys so much for taking your time in reading this long message hopefully you bought your product and enjoyed it.

Easy to set up. I honestly feel like it’s a new phone. The first thing I checked was the battery health and it was 100%! Everything functions perfectly. Love the Face ID. Great camera and sound. Once you get used to no home button, you won’t miss it. Without it the screen fills the whole phone. So the overall phone size is not too big, but you get more screen size - a win win in my opinion.

I had read reviews saying the phone would not turn on, so this was a bit concerning as I pressed that side button, fingers crossed that luck would still be in my favor. It was almost fully charged!! Now the last test. Was the phone paid off? Truly unlocked for any service?? I had also read reviews saying the phones could not be used on network due to not being paid off or in some cases even stolen!So I called my service provider, gave them the imei and my phone number and it was switched over without any issues at all.I am SUPER SUPER happy with my purchase!!

Not as they claim,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail.I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true.As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck.As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head.I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry*a bride from this father-in-law.Happy phone hunting!",2019年9月19日 在美国审核
iPhone in good condition,"It came in a plain white box with a functional charger (not original) and no headphones. The phone was covered with a clear plastic and had really minor scuffs (barely noticeable, I used a bright white light to search for scratches) at the base of the phone around the speaker and charging port. I would describe the appearance as excellent.No issues with setup. I tested camera, video call, video recording, phone call, touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity to fitbit, speakers and car. Everything worked fine. Works like a new phone. Battery health is at 84% (I wish it was over 95%) but it works much better than my old iPhone and I'll replace the battery in time if it does not hold charge. It got a bit hot while using it which I'll assume had to do with the phone consuming a lot of data from the installation and setup process.This phone was purchased for use in Trinidad &amp; Tobago on bmobile network. It connected easily without an issues therefore the phone is unlocked as stated. This was my first 24 hours with the phone and I'm very pleased with this renewed purchase. Synergy was the only seller that I found with little negative reviews and I am glad and feel relief that I chose this seller.If there are any issues within the next few weeks, I'll update this review.Update April 2020: With regular FaceTime use I realised that that is a minor flaw with the camera. The screen has intermittent black flashes that last for a second. I've noticed it and the person on the other end of the call noticed it. Other than that, the phone works as described.",2020年1月8日 在美国审核

Phone arrived and works like brand new.,"4/29: Wow! I really thought that this could go south, however, once it arrived it was working as a brand new iPhone, luckily I had a key to open the SIM tray, otherwise I would have had a hard time finding a way to open it. It's been now almost 3 weeks since first started to use the phone and not one trace of a damage or defect has been found and I like all of the features it includes. Kudos to the seller Electronic Deals who sent this one like new and made me happy for the upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone X.UPDATE 6/9: This phone has not failed at all since first use, the only detail is that when you turn it back on, unless it is plugged to the charger wire, it will take a lot of time to boot up, other than that, there are absolutely no complains for this product.Update 3/24/21: The phone has made it so far intact, not a single damage from falls (my hands are so slippery sometimes) and though the battery is two years old or more (as the phone as well) it doesn’t take long to lose the charge and when it’s at 1% it takes longer to turn off.It has issues with face recognition at some point, but those were more of a software issue than hardware.

Very Happy,"I bought this renewed iPhone X for my wife, who was very reluctant to upgrade from her v7 iPhone. The reason for this was during her last upgrade 6 years ago, she lost most of her contacts and photos. However, this upgrade was flawless. Apple has improved this process so well that even my techno-phobic wife found it impressive. The entire process took about five hours to complete, as it transferred all her contacts, notes, pictures, apps and everything. The only glitch I had was after installing the SIM card.The phone dropped the first 3 calls she made, so I checked the SIM card, reseated it, and that fixed the problem.The phone itself was in very good shape. In fact, it looked brand-new. My wife loves the face recognition (not on v7). The battery life seems good, it's lasting the entire day.

Absolutely 0 issues and problems since the day we got these iPhone X. Both phones we got are fully unlocked. We used both iPhones under VodaFone when we lived in Italy until May 2019. Now, one iPhone X uses AT&amp;T and the other uses Verizon. This just to show that the product description remains true, it is 100% unlocked.

Glass back is the same with no visible scratching from arm length or even close inspection. Camera and glass lens cover work very well.At 92% battery life is still good, as ""Renewed Premium"" says battery will be 90% or better. The only visible flaw were a few very light scratches on the bezel but are barely noticeable. I have a case covering it now so its very out of sight and out of mind. The phone also came in an Amazon Renewed branded box with a generic but new phone charger set with some warranty info.There is supposedly a 20 point inspection the phone had about 9 weeks ago according to the warranty card.More peace of mind than purchasing off FB marketplace but you pay slightly more for it.Setup was a breeze for my Cricket Wireless SIM Card.

I wasn’t the least bit disappointed with this purchase,"I bought this for my Wife for her birthday in January to replace her iPhone 7. Neither she or I are tech nerds and couldn’t care less about having the latest and greatest when it comes to phones. We both have used the iPhone platform for at least a decade, so naturally, we stick with it due to the familiarity with the operation and use of these Apple products.I was a little worried about when reading reviews as some people loved this product and others complained about scratches and imperfections. The one I received was flawless. I didn’t see a single scratch or blemish on it. The battery was dead when it arrived, but quickly fired up after being charged for a few minutes.The battery life seems fine, even though the battery life feature says that it had a max of 86%. My wife hasn’t had an issue at all with it draining in an inordinately fast manner and she used it a lot.She especially likes the privacy feature in which the screen isn’t visible to others from the side.Since she and I both aren’t keen on the facial recognition feature that replaced the Finger ID on this phone, she just uses the 6 digit passcode to unlock. It was slightly annoying at first, but not an issue considering that’s how it used to be in the “old” days of iPhones anyway.This phone does everything my wife wants it to do and arrived in absolutely pristine condition. The box is generic, there are no ear buds with it and the lightning cable and block are also generic. None of these make any difference to her since she has Bluetooth ear buds already and we have about a dozen blocks and cables already. The seller made it clear what would come with the phone, so we were already okay with that.All in all, this was a great value.

Great price for a refurbished phone,I bought this phone as a birthday gift for my dad. He had an iPhone 6 and the battery was on its last leg. He would literally make a few calls and it would die. He was going to get the battery replaced for $59. But I told his wife to asked him to wait so that I could surprise him with a newer one. Upon arrival I opened it and the phone is flawless like if it was never pre-owned by anyone. They did a great job refurbishing it! Once I gave it to him we switched his T-Mobile SIM card into it and went through the process of transferring everything from his old phone to the new one. Everything went smooth and in 10 min he was able to make and receive calls. All his apps also transferred which he loved!!!

Great phone. Choose your seller wisely!,"PLEASE NOTE: iPhone X 256GB was my purchase. I returned the first phone because I was not happy with the screen quality. I felt at arms length it had visible scratches on the screen I could see.I wasn’t after perfection but knew it could be better. I am leaving all 5 stars now because I returned the first and had a replacement that met my expectations in around 5-6 days (that’s me shipping back first phone and then them shipping another phone to me upon receiving my return).They also covered all fees associated with return process.No scratches at all on second phone. Basically flawless. I recommend picking your seller wisely. I searched and found hybrid IT and they did not disappoint throughout the whole process.If you pay attention to the ratings of the particular seller you are buying from, you can get a better idea for what you can expect.This phone is excellent and I am glad I chose the particular seller I went through on this refurbished phone.

FANTASTIC! Like new phone! 10/10!,"Like most folks, I was a bit scared of ordering a 'renewed' phone. As a matter of a fact, I have ordered some in the past, but none this expensive. Im not sure if I just got lucky or what, but my phone, on a scale of 1 to 100, was a 98! Near mint condition! only upon super close inspection did I find 2 tiny little scratches.. besides that, the phone was basically brand new. No evidence of a replaced screen with a cheap after market or anything like that. Battery holds 100%, functions and sound all 100%. Updated nicely and was fully 100% unlocked. Im very happy with this purchase! :)",2021年3月30日 在美国审核
"So far, So good","This unlocked iPhone X is a replacement for one that was returned because of poor battery health. This one, the replacement, has 100% battery capacity. I'm guessing the battery was replaced or the previous owner never used it. In any case, this iPhone X looks and works like new. I can't see any scratches or blemishes, and I looked close, very close. My SIM card for US Cellular works fine and no issues with connecting voice or data. The company that refurbished this phone sent out the replacement to me before I sent back the defective one., which is a plus for them. I waited a few weeks before writing this review to make sure it continued to work. So far no issues. If they are all like this I would buy from them again.UPDATE 4/25/22: It is still working like new. I added an Incipio case to protect it. I have been using it as a Hotspot for my laptop and works without issue any problems",2022年4月11日 在美国审核
Works perfectly fine.,"So I was very scared to but this phone because first of all I had never bought a phone on amazon and second well the phone was not brand new. Also this page did not have many reviews. But the information I read about the phone was everything I needed, plus they have free return in case it didn’t work out . So I bought the phone. Wow it looks and works like brand new. No scratches at all very nice and it works perfectly. I wanted the phone unlocked because I currently live in Mexico and yes it works just fine.

Do not be discouraged!,"Looking through the reviews, I was pretty hesitant to get the phone. I think with any phone that is bought used there is a great risk of issues. The phone itself came in great shape unlike some of the other reviewers claimed. There was a bit of an issue activating the phone due to whatever carrier might have had the phone before it was unlocked. Regardless, it just took a trip to the carrier store to get the phone switched over.As of now, the phone works great with little issues.

Nice buy in 2022,"Upgraded from my iPhone 7plus,this was a noticeable upgrade between that. Got used to no physical button and face recognition as well. The price was awesome for the 256gb version, I don’t like buying pricy phones but this one for the space it provides was well worth it for me.Camera isn’t as cinematic like the newer phones but it’s still good and can use for high quality photos and videos.I will say the screen did take some getting used to, my iPhone 7plus had a “bigger” screen going left to right, but the iPhone X has a much bigger screen top to bottom. It’s “skinnier” but longer, which shows more notes, webpages and and text top to bottom,but is smaller text in exchange left to right. I’ll definitely upgrade to a bigger phone with a bigger screen going forward, but this will do for now!",2022年3月7日 在美国审核

So far so good.,I took a gamble ordering this phone I wasn't feeling the negative reviews but the positive reviews outshine the negative. I was prepared when opening my package so I recorded myself doing so in case something went wrong during transit but it was in good condition and looks brand new. facial rec. doesn't always catch on the first try but oh well I gave 4 stars cause of that. battery was at 73 when I figured out how to check it idk what percentage it goes up or if it dies down as you use it usually it charges 100% with my other phones but I'm charging in hopes it charges to higher percentage. not too sure why they ask me to rate battery life. but 4 stars is good enough. id put 5 stars if it charged 100% obviously. overall its worth the money for me you have my approval. gang,2020年12月11日 在美国审核

Quality Product as Advertised from Amazon Refurbished,"This product (Apple iPhone X from MobileSpree) seems to deliver as promised from user reviews. Following additional user reviews from YouTube, the device appears to still be installed with an Apple Certified OLED screen and I was unable to observe any screen burn-in. I am a little disappointed that iOs software indicates Battery Health is at 84% Maximum Capacity, but this still meets the promise from Amazon Refurbished devices of being at least &gt;80%. I did not see any blemishes or scratches; thought the device had a polished screen, I noticed a little grime (probably oil residue from hands of previous owner) along the power and volume buttons.Overall, I am currently satisfied with device.

Really good for refurbished phones,I bought two of these phones one came with 100% battery life and the other one came with 95% battery. Everything on the phone looks new. Hardly no scratches at all. The one phone came almost dead and the other with a little less then half charged. And on the one phone it looks like there is a screen protector on it but it’s just the screen raised for what ever reason it’s not coming off it just looks like it has a thick glass screen on it.

The phone was too small for the box and I could shake it and hear the phone being tossed from side to side in the box. I wasn't too happy about that and was worried that the phone might be damaged.In the end the phone was perfectly fine, no scratches and it really looked brand new! I was so surprised and happy to find that the phone WAS unlocked as advertised and that the battery life was at 87% which is more than I expected.

Definitely a good buy -Highly recommend,"Wow ..I was really thinking this phone would show up and looking used .. but I was wrong!!It was in super great shape, no scratches or wear on it at all . The only sign of use was the very fine wear on the silver metal outside trim - which is covered by my new phone case anyways, right !!!!Silly me, I ordered the iPhone X, which is actually slightly smaller than the iPhone 8+, that I was upgrading from, but upon closer examination... I noticed that the screen is actually slightly longer than the iPhone 8 plus and just barely smaller screen when you consider the fact that it’s from edge to edge design and no longer has the action button in the middle.I really love the new feature of face recognition that saves me so much time and is very convenient at work knowing... apps just open so easy now &amp; knowingthat no one can steal my phone, or pick it up and get information that is vital personal information on credit cards and such. There are just too many new features to name them all but it is definitely an upgrade from an 8+!!!It did take me a few days to get used to the phone, &amp; how different this phone is overall, the Touch screen is just very different ...&amp; because I’m just not a very techy person...but I caught on really fast within three days I was in love with the phoneI would highly recommend buying from this seller, definitely worth saving the",2020年3月13日 在美国审核

Do not hesitate to update your old phone.,I bought this to replace my old Iphone 7. I was skeptical like everyone trying to buy a phone that you will put in your sim card.

The phone charges well and a full battery lasts the day. Both front and back cameras take great pics!Memory is what we expected and is much better then the 32gb on the old phone. These things really make a difference. The seller was great, reliable and honest. I got more than what I paid for and more then I expected!!

An upgrade at a fraction of the cost!,"I really like to buy Amazon renewed products when I have the opportunity.Not only have I saved a TON of money, but I like giving things a second life, but with the safety of being able to return it if it arrives broken or damaged.I have purchased iPads, my HP laptop, my smart sprinkler controller and other smart phones renewed and have yet to be let down.I was a little worried when this iPhone X arrived in some strange box that just said, ""smart phone"" and when I opened it up and saw that the cables were all generic.I was worried it was a fake, but it was the real thing.It wasn't quite as clean as I hoped it would be (physically) but it didn't have any real cosmetic damage, so I cleaned it up, popped in a T-Mobile SIM card, ran a software update and BOOM!We were off and running.It looks and works like a brand new iPhone X.I love that I was able to upgrade from my iPhone 8 without having to pay full price for a brand new device.If you're considering trying an Amazon renewed device, I can attest to them.So far I've had really good experiences.I took off a star because I expected it to come in original packaging and with OEM cables etc. and for it to be clean like new, but otherwise it was perfect.I sincerely hope this review was helpful for someone else!Feel free to ask any questions!",2021年8月12日 在美国审核

Battery Scam,"I’ll tell you what I’ve learned from this experience:1. Most likely, your battery will come at barely 80% or below. Mine came at 78% and “severely degraded” and I had to replace the battery at Apple - this adds $75 on the price you see.2. If the phone has ANY indication of a drop, send it back. Either the front or back panel was most likely replaced with non-Apple parts, so the phone will be garbage.Check your screen for “True Tone” color and if the hardware doesn’t fit in the casing.3. Gently remove the screen protector as soon as you receive the device. Refurbished suppliers use these to hide scratches, etc.4. Finally, search for the Phone’s identification number and make sure it’s not stolen.Generally, I think this is a hit or miss sleazy industry. I’m VERY disappointed in Amazon for sending out devices that are not to the specifications they list (especially battery life).Electronic Deals (the refurbishing company) was totally unresponsive.I had my device thoroughly checked at Apple, and felt like paying for the repair was less of a hassle than sending it back, even if this poor review isn’t worth the money I lost.",2021年3月13日 在美国审核

Do not waste your time...horrible experience all around,"I was hoping to get a new, unlocked, refurbished iPhone to surprise my boyfriend. The phone came, and was a little dinged up, but nothing too horrible. I also noticed that the battery life was already stated to be at ~85%, which is not what I consider refurbished (should be like new??). Nevertheless, I still gave it to him and he started the process of switching everything over to his new phone. He wasn't able to get his SIM card to recognize, so we had to go to the T-Mobile store. They told us at the store, after quickly looking up the phone serial number, that this phone is LOCKED and is registered as a lost or stolen phone. It is completely unusable to us, and we WASTED HOURS of our time. I am in the process of sending it back for a refund (as well as the accessories we bought separately which we now can't use). The seller, Chubbiestech, is completely unreachable when I call the phone number to try to get more information on ensuring a successful return. I have not been able to contact them and hopefully can get the information I need from Amazon.Overall this experience has been horrible and upsetting and a waste of time. I am extremely disappointed and embarrassed that I gave this as a gift, only to find out this unusable phone has likely been stolen from someone and sold to me.",2021年4月19日 在美国审核

Hit or miss purchase...,"Please read before buying: My phone has been holding up great after a month of using it. Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won’t turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I’d say that I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it’s a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i’ve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn’t been entirely paid off. Also, their “refurbishments” aren’t really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There’s only one problem that really isn’t that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished.

its whatever,"I'm reviewing this more as what you may expect from a renewed device.Mine was purchased through seller: Kiss Electronics IncThe phone is in decent condition, has the usual damage from being in a case all its life, doesn't show much damage which would come from being out of a case. It also came with a glass type screen protector as they do despite not being too scratched up.The screen, however, was cracked. I have attached a picture of where the crack is.Kinda cringe that I received a phone with a crack in the screen, but it is very minor and should not affect the usage. I'll choose to keep it despite this problem, because it's too much effort to send it back, and it will still fulfill it's intended use. No point in sending it to a landfill.Turning it on, it appeared to be set up or prepared with apple configurator, as it did not ask for any setup steps aside from wifi connection. This breaks apple's terms of use I'm pretty sure.It accepts a sim card fine so at this point I added it to my apple DEP and to my MDM, to which it did just fine (meaning it wasnt previously enrolled to anyone else's company).The phone is fully functional, no battery service messages, truetone works, no warnings, faceID is fine, nothing indicating the phone having had a third party repair. Came with 86% battery life left, I cant be bothered to test the capacity. Overall it functions perfectly as intended.I was feeling extra bored today so I decided to validate Amazon's promise on the device accessories that the cable is MFI certified and the charger brick is UL listed.It came with a sharkk branded charger and cable.The charger brick has a license and model number printed on it which come up as registered by Shenzhen DBK Electronics.I can not find any connection between sharkk and DBK.I did find just one of the other 13 model numbers on the UL cert to also be a sharkk product.For the cable, sharkk is not listed in Apple's MFI Authorized Manufacturers list.Shenzhen DBK is also not in Apple's MFI Authorized Manufacturers list.it was included a sim card removal tool which was actually really good quality. it is much flatter than the normal stamped steel ones and had a much higher quality finish.I bought this to issue out to an employee as a company phone.",2021年5月12日 在美国审核

"Camera shutter sound won't turn off, even when the phone is muted and all sound settings are off","The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great.However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera.As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!).Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.TLDR: nice phone, in great condition, good price, came on time, but this particular phone is unusable for anyone who likes to take pictures",2019年7月25日 在美国审核
IPhone X -This entire process is doable by anyone who uses a smartphone.,"This iPhone X was purchased to replace a vintage iPhone 6. Free shipping and delivery as promised. The package camebubble wrapped with no shipping or handling damage. This iPhone X looks like new. It was free of scratches, bumps or bruises. The only thing notable is that the battery only charges to 85%, even through it indicates 100%. It came with a screen protector, SIM card key and a charging cable, also.The Xhada 60% charge, so startup via theguided instructions was initiated. There was a bit of drama during the transfer of my backup from the old phone via bluetooth.I had to reboot the X and switch to iCloud to restore the backup via WiFi.Once I learned to do that, the data and APPS were on the new X in a few minutes.Next I removed the SIM from the 6 and installed it in the X. This entire process is doable by anyone who has used a smartphone.

"Nice Looking Phone - Battery Degraded/Used (Lying ""Functions Like New"" Ad Copy)","When you buy a phone that says ""renewed"" and advertised as looking and functioning ""like new"", you would expect the battery to be new or close to new.It's already degraded and only has 87% capacity.While this functionality will be (just) okay for a while, I'll be facing another $60 cost in the next few months.Why say renewed when, at best, maybe some glass was replaced or something.Renewed and functioning like ""new"" means that ALL of the functionality should be like new.The battery health is part of the functionality.The overall cosmetic condition is very good and I was only able to locate the smallest of blemishes anywhere on the phone.The screen is in excellent condition.I recommend on ANY phone purchase, you get a protective case.I ordered the Otter Box for mine.Considering the condition of what this phone is replacing, I am glad to have it but I am angry that the ad lied about how the phone ""..functions like new.""It should be made clear; especially since I chose a Prime listing with expectations that the condition would be accurate.",2021年10月18日 在美国审核

Honestly it’s kinda infuriating for me,"This phone is so suitable for what I needed in a phone—really long battery life, more security with Face ID, and a decent amount of storage. But one issue has plagued my phone: the touch screen. I’m not sure what it may be (an almost invisible imperfection on the screen or a hardware problem are probably the two most likely suspects), but my screen tends to glitch the hell out on me from time to time.Sometimes it’s when my phone is starting to warm up, sometimes it’s when I’m on low battery, and sometimes it’s at totally random times. The glitches mainly affect the very bottom of my screen, either making it impossible for me to swipe up to change apps or unlock my phone, or constantly wiggling around my whole screen without me touching it; additionally often clicking on things I never clicked on. It’s so infuriating that I’ve brought my rating down to a 2.Surely this isn’t an issue for anyone else, right? Because I’ve looked this up extensively and seemingly I’m one of very few people having this issue at all. Hell, not a single person who bought from this seller here on Amazon has had the same issue as me from what I’ve seen! I’m glad that there are some people out there who know this issue exists and they have solutions to them, but I can’t solve the issue I’m having with my own phone because of accessibility issues when it comes to certain tools or computer programs to fix the issue.Lesson of the day: don’t buy a used phone from Amazon. I was let down for the first time with my old 6s, and now I’ve been let down for the second (and last) time with my X. If you’re gonna get a used phone, just hope your friend or one of your family members is getting a new phone, or just buy a new phone if you’re getting impatient waiting for that lucky day of yours to come.",2020年1月14日 在美国审核

No help for dreaded ghost touch,"I ordered the phone and it worked well for a few months until it started the dreaded “ghost touch”. I took it to the apple store as they have a program to fix it for free as it is a known hardware issue. They would not fix it for less than $279 because there were third party parts. I contacted the seller (within the 90 days) to find out the next steps and they suggested a few rests to “fix” the problem. By the time I did the “fixes” and the ghost touch came back, I was told it was too late to return and now I am stuck with a phone that types and changes screen on its own. Needless to say I am unhappy with this customer service as it is clearly spa defect that is known and that I had nothing to do with and it is being held to some ridiculous warranty although it was brought to the attention of the seller before hand. I can’t help but feel like I have been duped. The cosmetic parts of the phone were great, it’s the hardware that is the issue.",2021年2月25日 在美国审核

iPhone X Rewound,"My Pixel 4 over heated and warped the cover so badly that it wouldn't close at all. So I decided to try iPhone again.

Their support basically consists of Web FAQs and some answers, but not everything. But this iPhone X is much easier to use and does a lot more than the old 7 did. I did purchase a clear plastic case for it which means I'm less likely to bust it by dropping it. I've had it about a week now, and have spent some time organizing the Apps into common groupings while also down loading a few apps I use regularly that are not on the iPhone 10 to begin with.

IT'S NOT FULLY UNLOCKED and WORST customer support,"As soon as the product arrived I tested it and see what went wrong, I am surprise but also disappointed in the same time. So here are my pros and cons about the item; Pros :What I love the most about it is the touch screen, I was very surprise how the touch screen works perfectly smooth, the battery life is great and the screen so crispy clear.Cons :Since the seller didn't provide the real picture of the item so It's very disappointing to find out that there are tiny scratches around the camera as you can see from the picture 2. It is not noticeable but it's not acceptable for me. Also it's not fully unlocked. Why ? Because I tested to make a phone call using my SIM card (Total wireless) it seems to work with LTE, however the internal speaker is very deep as in the other voice of the person I was talking to is very far although it's already on the highest volume.Then me and my husband tried to use his phone to call my number, but unfortunately it didn't work, so I thought maybe we have to be a little bit further, then he went outside while I'm inside calling using his phone.But again it didn't receive anything. As you can see on pic 1, it went to a voicemail meanwhile the iPhone didn't show anything. But I didn't take a pic of this iPhone received the voicemail notification on inbox.However I didn't try using speaker or headset so I have no clue about that.ALSO, the most annoying thing is that I tried to call their customer service andI spoke to one of them over the phone regarding my issue but she didn't bother to ask what would be the issue about the item etc instead she refused to help me create a shipping pick up label for UPS and persistently saying that they only provide UPS label for drop off. As I explained my situation that we do have stay home order but she only saying that I can request pick up service and other shipping services but it'll be in my cost, she was also mentioned that I can return the item when the stay home order is over, which I don't know when. Then again she refused to help me to create the shipping label for UPS pick up. In the end she hangs up the phone on my face. When I report it to the seller via message box the other customer service completely ignore my concern.Anyways, their refund will be issued 3 days after the item has arrived which after the inspected the whole thing with the item. I asked them about how long the item will be arrived they didn't even give me an estimate time.This is my first time experience but It's SO disappointing. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM A 3rd PARTY SELLER.It's too much hustle in your part if you're hoping to get it done quickly. Hope this helps.",2020年7月16日 在美国审核
Beautiful iPhone X!,"Beautiful iPhone for $330. I traded it in with my carrier T-Mobile for a $830 credit towards the iPhone 12 Pro Max. They said the previous carrier was Sprint (not T-Mobile as advertised), but since Sprint &amp; T-Mobile have merged this was no big deal. The seller shipped it the same day, but because of one day of bad weather back East, UPS took OVER 2 weeks to deliver it to Los Angeles!

Saved so much money buying used.,"So with the first iPhone X I bought, the microphone didn’t work. So test all the features before you start making the phone your own. Lesson learned.

At times there are really minor glitches, like I won’t be able to press send after typing a text or I’ll have to say “hey Siri” really loud. But then it’ll work fine. It’s odd, but it doesn’t happen often enough to make me regret not spending $500 more on a phone I’ll just replace in a couple years anyway. Plus Amazon bought my old iPhone, so I got some money out of it anyway! Would recommend renewed for sure.",2021年6月17日 在美国审核

The Amazon renewed program is broken,"I ordered iPhones from two different suppliers with mixed results and returned both. Although I returned them because I ordered the ""all carriers version"" (A1865) and received the GSM-only version (A1901), my main issue was the variation in what ""new from arms length"" means. One phone I received was truly almost new looking. Just one small scratch on the screen and what looked like some pry marks inside the bezel, I'm guessing from replacing the glass, but the second phone I received was trashed, the back was scuffed, the bezel was badly scratched and all was easily visible from arms length. I don't know how anyone could interpret the second phone as being ""renewed"".<br>The other issue is with the battery life criteron. According to my research online, Apple recommends replacing the battery when it falls below 80% lifetime. That's when the problems begin to occur. For reference, my 5 year old iPhone 6s still has a remaining battery life of 94%, so 80% is pretty much done for and needs replacing. Both renewed phones I received, however, had battery life between 80-85%, which means they were almost needing to be replaced. So it is a ""renewed"" phone, but the battery will need to be replaced very soon. So I ask myself, if I'm paying $500 and screens and glass backs are being replaced, why shouldn't the battery be replaced as well? What would that cost, an additional $10? $500 seems like a lot of money for a phone with a bad battery (or close to it).my suggestions to Amazon with regards to their ""renewed"" program: please ensure that the sellers actually hold to your criteria, and also I would have the batteries replaced as part of the program. Otherwise you're just selling 100% used phones at 100% refurbished prices, and for me that's misrepresenting the product as well as charging about $100-$150 too much.</br>",2020年10月8日 在美国审核

IT WOULDN’T CHARGE. Took to to a tech shop the following day to get a wireless charger incase the port was an issue and that didn’t work. They tested it and told me that the battery life is degraded to the point where charging it cannot bring it back to life. I decided to contact the seller and ask for a partial refund so that I can fix the phone. I explained that I’m overseas and I can’t return it because it’s ridiculously expensive. I stated that I will keep the phone and I’m willing to pay to fix it but I need to be compensated since I have to fix what should be an already working device. I initially asked for a $60 refund because that’s what it’s cost me to replace the battery. Seller was adamant that they will give me a $30 refund or return the phone. He also went on further to say all personal information should be removed from the phone before returning or it will affect my refund. HOW ON EARTH DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THIS WHEN THE PHONE WONT TURN ON?! .. Amazon is a whole different story… NOT HELPFUL! They both disgust me and I will never purchase electronics from Amazon again.

I was not able to get a replacement so I had to purchase another iphone, then return this one and am currently waiting for my refund.The second one I purchased had a perfect screen performance but I was not able to record any videos on any app including sending a video message. It always came out sounding staticy and barely audible.For this Amazon gave me a refund to purchase another one prior to sending back the old one.When I received the 3rd iphone, I was sure this one would be perfect but I was wrong. It has the exact same problem as the second phone at first but it appears to have cleared up. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 2.",2021年2月28日 在美国审核

Horribly Repaired product. Beware.....,"I ordered this iPhone for my wife. I got the product and the moment I took the phone in my hand, I could find the Siri button felt little different/loose than my existing iPhone X(which I purchased brand new a year back). Also noticed a major scratch on central frame which would have caused original display damage. Also I could totally see that the display was replaced and the sealing glue was oozing out from left upper side of display. Such kind of phone would not stand against water spills. It took me just 5 mins to figure out the product I was delivered was horribly repaired. I didn’t expect this from Amazon! Very very disappointed.",2019年6月20日 在美国审核
Bought 3 for my preteens,"Two out of the three were great. They had around 80% battery life, no scratches and worked great. The last one came with 50% battery life. It also has a glass screen protector where others didn’t. This last phone had some weird pixelated issues on one part. It wasn’t too bad. I decided to see if we could work through it. It just got worse. Phone would turn off randomly and would just keep resetting. The pixelation issue got worse. I tried to return, unfortunately I was just out of my return window because of health issues. I hoped I could get it fixed or a refund since I had bought so many of them. It’s been a month after they received and I haven’t gotten anything figured out with them yet. So 2/3 were good and still working but the last one well it’s caused a lot of tears and stress. So be wary. It is completely my fault for not returning it right away and trying to just deal with it. Not all the phones are equally good though.",2021年6月30日 在美国审核

Was good but Face ID stopped working. Returned phone.,"After about 30 days the Face ID quit working. Worked when we went to bed and was met with a “Face ID has been disabled” message upon waking up and unlocking phone. Restarted the phone and was stuck in a “boot loop” and eventual 4013 error when trying to restore to factory settings on a MacBook Pro. Finally was able to restore after an entire day on with apple care to no avail by restoring to factory on a windows laptop via iTunes. Face ID still didn’t work. Thankfully the 90 day amazon warranty was still in play which means I’ve had to repurchase the phone and return the first one which is obviously a hassle. Silver lining the phone is 40$ less now than a month prior but still irritating. Also, now for whatever reason the phone won’t play YouTube videos and another day with YouTube and apple reps haven’t provided any help of note. Hopefully the new refurb doesn’t have this issue when it arrives.But the phone did arrive looking awesome basically new no issues there with a screen protector pre installed and battery level showed like 90% upon receipt and first charge.

Perfect so far other than one irritating defect,"I'll start off by saying this phone is pretty decent for the price. Once I got everything set up and my SIM card from my previous iPhone in place, it worked really well. No scratches, audio is good, battery life is fine, and the storage capacity is amazing.However, the one major problem I have with this phone is that the charging port won't hold the part that plugs in. No it's not the charger it came with that is flawed, I have tried multiple chargers that are completely compatible and functioning, they just won't stay in. The only way I can get it to charge is if I jam the plug in and nudge it to the left. Doing that allows it to charge, but I can't hold it or use it easily without the charger slipping loose and falling out again. It's really annoying but not worth exchanging honestly, just something to expect or be wary of when buying a pre-owned phone, they're not going to be perfect. I may see if I can trouble shoot this issue myself or get it looked at if I'm really desperate, but since it at least has the capability to charge when it's sitting still and I'm not using it, it's something I can deal with.",2021年6月1日 在美国审核
Touch screen defective,"This phone screen gave me problems from the start. I put a thick screen protector on it and was told by a friend who is pretty savvy with cell phones that perhaps the screen protector was too thick and that’s why my touchscreen wasn’t responding like it should. It worked good enough most of the time but it seem to always give me some problems. Of course after the warranty was up the real problem started and if I would be out walking in 40° weather my screen would not respond at all. I tried putting on a new screen protector thinking that would help and saw that the edge of my screen was broken. I think this phone would’ve been OK for the long-haul if I would have used a more protective case, this phone never worked 100% like it should have , it was my first iPhone I learned a huge lesson.",2022年3月28日 在美国审核

This UNLOCKED phone was in fact LOCKED and the carrier was unable to activate it.,"I have never had an iPhoneX before. I'm sure it has great features and Apple lovers have little or no complaints. I gave the product a crummy rating because I ordered the unlocked version of this phone. I then went to my carrier (Verizon) and was shown right on the screen the field that said ""Carrier Locked"". Then I spent an hour with Amazon customer support on chat trying to get a refund. It's hard to get a refund when the chat person keeps asking if they can call you and you tell them, ""No, you can't because I have no phone."" I may be crazy, but once the return goes through and I am refunded for this phone (and the Zagg glass sheild I was dumb enough to apply BEFORE I went to Verizon), I will order another one of these, but I will just get the Verizon version. If that doesn't work, guess I'll worry about what to do next.Update:FYI, I went ahead and got the Verizon version. Worked out of the box once I installed the sim card.

I can’t complain enough!,"I Purchased Three iPhone X 256 gig phones from this seller. I was very skeptical about purchasing a renewed phone from Amazon. Upon unboxing my first phone I was super impressed! the phone looked practically brand new and there were very minor imperfections, not enough to make me disappointed in my purchase. However ,upon using the phone I realized that it was glitchy it would open and close apps by itself and it would often freeze . it was really just a very annoying phone .But I didn’t want to discount this company so I texted the Customer Service per the instructions on their page ,there was no response. I literally texted them over 100 times and no one ever responded. when I reached out to them through the Amazon app they did respond quickly with auniform answer that didn’t actually answer the question I asked. However , I ordered another phone ,transferred my information and return the original phone. because the phone was defective, I was fully refunded (note: there are various restocking fees for this seller) the second phone I Purchased ,was also defective. The phone itself had much more damage than the first and the screen came with a few scratches , not a deal breaker. My big issue is the phone is a few millimeters larger than a normal iPhone.it doesn’t properly fit in an iPhone case. I don’t know why it’s mishaped.the functionality of the phone is OK , so far it works fine I have yet to have any trouble with it.the shape of it causes problems because in order to use the side buttons , I have to take my phone case off and put it back on constantly. for the price I paid for this phone ,I don’t feel likeI should have to deal with that hassle ! I’m not sure if I’m going to purchase a third phone from this company. Maybe the third times the charm?other refurbished phone seller on Amazon havethe same kind of mixed reviews... so IDK . I’ll update my review if I decide to order from this seller again. My current phone is definitely going back.UPDATE: The third time was not the charm! I Purchased a third phone, thesize is OK.

No!!! Stuck with a phone that doesn’t work!!!,"My VERY first negative review. The phone received has pixel issues &amp; turns off without warning! No way that this could have passed a quality control inspection.

Your return will be processed when we receive it. Have a good day!” - their response. You must return your non working phone (that was supposed to be renewed) AND essentially be without a phone until they send you a replacement. This phone will be returned for REFUND &amp; I was forced to purchase from another seller. NEVER again. ALSO they charge YOU to ship/return your faulty device, even though Amazon policy reads “ You will need to return your item at no charge to you. If we do not receive your return after we issue you a refund or a replacement, we may charge you the original amount you paid for the item.“ They never said “we are sorry for the inconvenience” OR offered any customer service.

Screen Durability,"My daughter had dropped my phone from not even a 1 ft. fall and the screen itself popped off of the actual phone! The screen continued to work without being entirely on the phone, and hanging by a wire. I had tried to simply pop the screen back on but then the whole thing turned black and I wasn't able to see anything but I was still able to fell vibrating from notifications. I went to get it fixed the day after and come to find out the screen that was on there wasn't even the original screen, and on top of that the person who did put the last screen on put it on wrong resulting in the screen coming off. In my opinion, the fact that the screen WASN'T the original, it should've been stated in the description. And I also wasn't able to use my iCloud due to ""not enough storage"". But my other phone was only a 16GB and I still had space to give. Other than that everything else works fine.",2021年3月18日 在美国审核

Unexpected Touchscreen Issues,"While the iPhone X provides numerous features that are improvements over the previous models, it exhibits some problems with touchscreen functioning while the battery is charging. This results in one of two undesired behaviors:<br>1) Portions of the screen not responding to touch. This is usually in the upper corners.2) Greatly delayed response to touch such that the screen does not appear to respond at all followed by periods where the screen seems to be under the control of some outside force because multiple actions take place in rapid succession that completely ignore any actual touch commands being made in the moment.Best response is achieved by limiting interaction while the phone is charging.</br>",2022年1月20日 在美国审核

I tried all the normal ways to shut off the sound, and with research found that the only was to disable this feature would be to jailbreak the iPhone -- which I didn't want to do! Ultimately the feature proved to be too annoying, so I'll be returning and hopefully receiving a different model.",2020年3月28日 在美国审核

The display died!,"On September 9, 2020 I purchased an Apple iPhone X 64 GB factory unlocked smartphone. The price for this unit was $429.99. I was able to transfer the contents of my iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. The iPhone X worked for approximately a week, and then I went into a black screen mode. I Googled repairs and then contacted the Apple site to see about making the black screen go away. Nothing worked! I finally took the phone to my Apple Store in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester New Hampshire and the technician took the phone into the back room. The technician came back and informed me that the phone worked but the display did not. The display was aftermarket, not an Apple product. But for an additional $270+ I could have an Apple display installed. No thank you!!! I’ll return the phone to Amazon. The Apple technician stripped the iPhone X of all information and returned it to its original new in the box state.What I’m looking for now is a return authorization for the phone and a refund of the $429.99 to my credit card.

WORST PHONE EVER,"Okay but has some issues. It causes videos to upload very pixilated, my App Store wouldn’t work for a month, my keyboard lags, camera quality isn’t that great. Overall pretty dissatisfied. Wouldn’t buy again *update about 8 months later. : I feel like I wasted a lot of money on this phone because now I need to buy a new one. My last phone (iphone8+) worked great and lasted several years. This is a newer model and it is literally the worst. It lags ALL THE TIME. It over heats, it freezes, and shuts down. Nothing runs smoothly. Let’s not forget FACETIME DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE. I always face time my friends no problem, then all of a sudden when I switched to this phone FaceTime never connects. It will ring end ring and that is it. I honestly hate this phone. This is NOT an Apple iPhone, it’s a cheap fake knockoff phone posing as Apple. Yeah sure I have ios but I don’t believe for one second this phone is of Apple quality. Easily the worst money I’ve ever spent. Save your money, buy somewhere else.",2020年10月22日 在美国审核

Little disappointed.,"I am struggling a little bit here and and realizing the iPhone X is not new, it has been certified for use with no issues.When reading the description, the seller stated the battery life is at least at 80% which the one that was sent to me was not.Also, the screen jumps around on its own.I have to turn off or restart the phone several times in the one week I have had the phone thus far.I will also mention the top part of the screen does not always work.Again, I have googled for fixes and nothing seems to work.Will probably exercise 90 day warranty and send it back =(",2021年6月30日 在美国审核
RIP off.,"I got this thinking it would be just like in the description..there is nothing that infuriates me more than receiving a product like a phone that has some generic battery from China that heats up within 2 minutes of opening an app that really upsets me. I contacted the seller and they said I could send it back, well I dont have time for that , stuck done here in quarantine without another phone and things to take care of I am stuck with this cheap crappy phone.

Pretty good for used phone,"The iphone 10 came with all the stuff it said it would come with. (charger.) Battery life was good. Charges well. Pretty good phone. The only problem was when I spoke on the phone. I could barely hear the caller but the caller could hear me. I had to always put the phone on speaker to hear the person calling. Which isn't too bad, but if your in an open area, it can kinda be annoying. But its not too bad because its advised for people not to put phones very close to ears anyways because of radiation.But overall good phone.",2021年2月24日 在美国审核

Yesterday the phone locked up for 12 hours. I could not make or accept calls or even turn the phone off. I have replaced the SIM card, done several factory resets, and had both ATT and Apple run diagnostics. Apple suggested that it is probably a bad board. SO, beware.

Some sounds when watching videos would be muffled to inaudible. Then, a few months pass by and the Face ID is no longer functioning. I give it a few more months before the whole things falling apart. My intuition tells me this phone had previous water damage, a part or two were repaired and then sold on Amazon. There should be some type of quality control that goes into selling refurbished electronics because it is quite clear none has gone into this one.",2022年1月8日 在美国审核

Screen damage was covered by a protector!,"Purchased the phone back in March! Was very happy with how it appeared as a refurbished phone. Even came with a screen protector already on it which I was impressed by, but should have actually checked why.I just had to replace the screen protector this week... discovered that the phone had some pretty bad scratches and buff marks in the glass. And when I wiped the screen to put the new protector on I discovered that they had put a very thin polish on some of the scuffs on the end of the screen, which came off with the cleaning wipe. I did not expect the phone to be perfect, due to it being refurbished. But I was disappointed that it was not previously noted in the description that the screen would be more damaged that typical.This is my 4th refurbished phone and my screen has never been this bad. The screen protector does hide it very well. But still frustrating none the less. So if you get a phone with a protector I recommend removing it and checking the screens quality.",2020年7月25日 在美国审核

Apple support confirmed the problem and I was told to take it to a certified technician, who quoted me $150 USD because the warranty was expired.

Eventually turned on only for none of the buttons and the top half of the screen doesn't work. Water got in because the water resistant seal was previously broken.

Not an unlocked phone! Beware,"Really disappointed with this seller and the phone. Don’t waste your time or money! To begin, when we received the phone and tried to connect it to a carrier we were told the phone is locked. Informed the seller and they insisted it was unlocked. Attempted to connect to another carrier and again told it was locked. Contacted the seller a second time and instead of fixing it they tried to give me steps to do the job myself, as annoyed as I was having to do it myself, it still didn’t work. After many messages, the phone still was not unlocked!!! Finally we decided to return it and it’s been delivered for a week now and still NO REFUND has been issued!!!Throughly disappointed!

Some issues...,"My updated review: (2 stars): Had some issues with the phone. Battery life quickly plummeted to 80% and noticeably discharged faster. Camera lens seems unstable and rattles sometimes taking blurry pictures and video. I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn’t do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might notMy initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape.Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear.But there is a noticeable scratch in the display that is visible at greater than 12in distance.

"This was a Verizon phone, not AT&amp;T.","We bought this phone because of the thousands of great reviews, and were really bummed to find that while the phone worked it was not unlocked for AT&amp;T. We even took it to both the AT&amp;T and Apple stores to try and work with it and get it working, but both said that the phone was not on the right network to be able to work and be unlocked for AT&amp;T. When the Apple store looked at the settings they said it was only unlocked for Verizon and had appeared at an Apple store two months prior for the same issue and had been returned to Amazon. So this phone has been sold twice and wasn't able to work for the buyer for how it was advertised. It was super frustrating, so we just went ahead and bought a good phone from the Apple store, which we just have done from the start. I'm sure it would have been lovely if we got what was advertised, but we didn't.",2021年4月8日 在美国审核

Don not buy!!,I purchased a “renewed” iPhone X. The phone does not charge to its fullest capacity. The phone gets hot when it’s on too long. And my biggest issue is that the apps from previous owner is burned onto the screen. I was finally able to get a quote from the Apple Store to fix the issue which would cost about $125-$175.I contacted the seller and they offered me $20 and I would have to pay for the rest of the repair. My other option was to exchange for another phone.After all the back and forth now I would have to wait a week or so for a replacement from a company who mailed me a damaged phone to begin with? Or $20 to put towards the repair of a phone I just bought? This seller has poor customer service and a lack of internal communication.

All three Best Buy’s I went to yesterday didn’t have everything to replace it, and I have 3 appointments at different apple stores today. It’s out of warrant and on-apple care edgings, so I’m gonna end up pocketing $69 dollars in addition to the 340 or so spent so far.

Over the course of the next 2 days, with a call to apple support to determine that there were no software or hardware issues, 2 calls to AT&amp;T, and 3 trips to the AT&amp;T store, the phone was determined to be blacklisted and reported as stolen by the original owner.

Aside from this dead zone the phone would also register a bunch of false input and do all sorts of crazy things without me even touching the screen.CellCow claims to have a 30-point inspection before sending these out but that is obviously not the case.

"Horrible phone, faulty technology","The farcical recognition barely worked, the battery life was absolute crap. Originally the first phone I received was locked for AT&amp;T when I bought a FULLY UNLOCKED phone. I only had the first one for a couple days before Sprint told me that it was AT&amp;T locked. So then I had to exchange it for what I actually paid for. Then the second device I received only lasted a month before I started having problems and then I noticed the battery life was horrible and the facial recognition was barely functional. I barely even used the device, but I had to constantly have it plugged in if it was just going it be sitting there not being used or it would die so fast and even faster if I even used the device. Now I find out the logistics board is complete crap and the device won’t even turn on at all. I also found out that I bought the phone with the a crappy logistics board to begin with. So now I have to either spend 800+ and buy a completely new phone or 700+ for a new logistics board. Definitely telling my friends to avoid this company completely. I was given a faulty device, that wasn’t at all worth the money I paid for it. I wish it was possible to give zero stars. STAY AWAY, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.",2021年5月12日 在美国审核

And when I did make an effort early on to return it they were very unclear and broad about their instructions. Also the calling line did not even work.

Seller switched out original battery for cheap aftermarket one with less than 80% health.,Noticed my battery was dropping in health fast so took the phone to the apple store: they confirmed the battery was RECENTLY (within 3 weeks) switched and replaced with a very cheap and unreliable aftermarket battery that will eventually be completely shot within the next couple months (conveniently when the warrant and return policy would end). Seller probably keeps and resells the good batteries and sends us the cheap aftermarket ones. Makes me wonder what other cheap parts they switched out on us.

I would love to be able to review it properly if received withoutcracked screens so my first impression was not very good. Definitely not worth the money spent.,2019年12月12日 在美国审核
The touch screen is just not right,Ever since I got the phone I've been experiencing a few malfunctions with the screen but it got to the point where half of it wouldn't work. I need to lock and unlock the phone constantly to make it work properly and sometimes that wouldn't even do.Considering the money I have to spend on fixing it I can tell that this was not the worthiest purchase.,2020年4月7日 在美国审核
Bad refurbished iPhone!,"I purchased this iPhone for my moms bday. She transferred to this iPhone &amp; within 2 days the phone now only rings once &amp; has a blue hue on the screen. I contacted the company for a new iPhone, they said that I wld have to purchase another on for $360, then return the broken one for a refund. So it’s either I am forced to purchase another iPhone, or leave my mother without a phone for at least a week to do the return &amp; get another phone. This company’s policies definitely aren’t favorable to the consumer!",2021年10月11日 在美国审核
Bad Phone!!,This sucks. Got the phone for my wife and it has “ghost touches” which pretty much means that the screen recognizes touches that aren’t actually happening and makes the phone go crazy to where it is unusable. This started happening pretty much right after we got the phone and is only getting worse! Just save the money and go buy from an Apple store.,2021年1月6日 在美国审核

Large screen but fits in a pocket.,Had two weeks to return it. My original intent was to have a big screen with a phone small enough for my pocket. I read all the negative reviews. It took a few days to learn buttonless mauvering...but I learned it. Facial ID perfect. But for day to day use with no fear of back glass breaking I decided to swap the X for the 7.But at the last moment I decided to keep the ten. It does have the largest screen yet fits in my pocket.,2018年9月11日 在美国审核
One of the greatest iPhones ever made,"This is an amazing iPhone. Call it iPhone ex, Cross, Marks the Spot, Ten, who cares? Having it four years now without any problems is a testament of time. The newer iPhones are slightly nicer looking and take marginally better photos and videos. However, this is typical of Apple. Very incremental with high prices. I do realize that the best thing about iPhone is how much better and stable the battery life is, along with known and proprietary iOS--outstanding at worst. Even with the latest iOS updates, the iPhone X is so fast it is even faster than the new 2021 iPad Pro. (I should not delve into serious design issues just the other day.) The A12 processor is just blazing fast. The performance of iOS 14.7 is just as good as the performance that of iOS 11 back in the day. The camera did not exactly take the greatest video and photo quality at first, but iOS 12 the algorithms improved a bit. There is only one minor issue I have lately, and it may be a setting or carrier issue, but sometimes the cellular data does not load Internet browser web pages when not connected to WiFi. I noticed that VPN is enabled when using cellular instead of WiFI, which this feature can be disabled, but then immediately enabled again until WiFi network has been connected back to, where using cellular data stops. In other words, turning off cellular and using WiFI only causes errors loading web pages, even YouTube videos sometimes. It may be an automatic security feature (cellular hackers exist, maybe, but is that much harder due to encryption?). Having 256 GB of storage for a phone back in 2017 still works out well today. I might consider iPhone 13 next year, but hoping that 8K and 16 MP camera can be a thing then. Make sure you have a good case and screen protector for iPhone, or any smartphone. iPhone is less fragile than iPad, for instance, as they are smaller, and may be made of more expensive materials that are more durable, but the small form factor keeps the MSRP in check. Almost no complaints on the iPhone X. It is still, in my eye, mostly current technology. Not much has been improved upon. The speakers are amazing, perhaps an engineering feat--the newer and larger iPhone 12 Pro sounds slightly tinny and less bass, but soprano voices sound a bit 'off' on iPhone X. (I am an audiophile, or the average person may not distinguish such nuances.) Five stars. Definitely a must-have, if you can still buy one, and if you already have one, upgrading might not be needed. It depends on your needs and preferences aside from what is 'affordable.' Great screen, very good battery life (maybe drains a little more than it used to but not by much), excellent sound quality, and more reliable than some people being skeptics at launch. The notch is rather cool, I actually like it. A neat design feature. Little details like watching movies in full screen, the clock and cellular/WiFi status moves into the notch areas so nothing is obstructed. That cannot be easy to do both technically from hardware and software coordination. The headphone jack is history as of this model, which is OK, because headphones are bad for your hearing, and sometimes do not fit your ear. Sometimes I forget that headphones are still relevant since my younger days. I do not use face recognition, but what I have read, it works very well. X = Excellent. A+ product, Apple!",2021年7月29日 在美国审核

"Phone Lasted 130 Days, Refurbished Phone Warranty Is 90 Days","I bought a refurbished iPhone that I received on June 24, 2018. On November 3, 2018, while using the phone, I could feel the phone getting way too hot (for no reason), and then it shut itself down. I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days.<br>I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said “too bad, so sad” the warranty is 90 days. So, no, I do not recommend buying a refurbished iPhone, and I especially don’t recommend buying one from this third-party seller (Prime Mobility).</br>",2018年11月20日 在美国审核
IPhone X is complete BULLCRAP!,"STAY AWAY From APPLE products! When Apple’s Marketing Chief Phil Schiller gave his blessing to the iPhone X, ""So if you happen to be hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water... don't worry, dive down, grab it, rinse it, let it dry, you'll be fine.”You would *Think* Apple would stand by its product.WRONG! As it happened to me, I stopped my phone in shallow water, only 3 feet deep, for a few seconds, and IMMEDIATELY my phone bricked. I purchased my iPhone X for $1199 and I would expect my phone would last a few years and have the peace of mind that my phone would still work after that incident. Well I was more than angry when Apple would not even attempt to replace my product, but charges me $549 to replace with a $#%$ refurbished product. The Staff at genius bar were snobby and would not even care!You work hard for you money, you spend your hard earn dollars for a good quality product, but APPLE is only scamming you and stealing from you!THINK ABOUT IT!

"If Buying Amazon ""Renewed,"" make sure it's ""Renewed Premium""!","I learned the hard way on this purchase. I bought the Iphone X through Amazon Renewed store in December 2020. There IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH IPHONE X (&amp; later) TOUCHSCREENS going bezerk, all the apps opening and closing, links opening, randomly dialing people, etc. The only way to get it to stop temporarily is to turn the phone off and back on. This is known as ""ghost touch"" and is a manufacturing defect. Because of this defect, Apple ""graciously"" extended the warranty on their defective yet crazy expensive product for 3 years FROM THE INITIAL RETAIL SELL DATE. This is NOT the date YOU buy it refurbished. This is the date the brand new item was sold to its first owner, which on an iPhone X is apparently sometime in 2018. If the 3 year warranty is expired, APPLE WILL NOT FIX YOUR EXPENSIVE PHONE OF THEIR KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT AT THEIR EXPENSE. You will get to pay for that yourself. After paying hundreds of dollars for a fancy phone, expect to pay about $300 to replace the screen through an authorized Apple repair facility, or up to $200 through other cellphone repair clinics.Currently, this Iphone X is the most expensive paperweight I've ever had. Very dissatisfied with Apple on this. They need to do better.",2021年6月10日 在美国审核

This one won't properly detect my sim card, which I know is an issue with the phone because the one I was using previously did not have an issue along with the one that had been returned.

Screen has micro scratches,Advertised as refurbished.Screen has many micro scratches - can’t see them when it is On.But when off / dark screen you can see them.One is a blemish that causes the phone screen to click itself.It clicks itself often.Took into Apple dealer (not Apple) because there is a screen chip problem with the X also.However they ran the diagnostic 2x and said nope it’s fine — but look closely when it’s off.These abrasions are triggering.,2021年11月3日 在美国审核

It feels like they bought a fair condition iPhone off of eBay and resold it for up to 100$ more than they paid for them. Everything is working though.

I don't think these folks are ""renewing"" anything. It came looking dirty as crap, caked up funk around the camera from being in a case for so long and never cleaned. I was able to clean it myself but it was never refurbished or renewed by anyone. Just adjectives these companies use to sell the higher grades of used phones. Anyway, I still prefer amazon's pre-owned over anywhere else. Like I said out of a dozen phones only one had to go back,and it wasn't bc of cosmetic issue,it was software.

"As advertised, functions well- except one issue","In the aspect of this being an Apple phone, it functions well, and in general there is no huge issues.BUT at first it wouldn't work on any apps and I finally took it to my Verizon store just to have them tell me that ""for whatever reason Iphones aren't playing well with VPN's""so I won't be able to use my VPN until I go to an Apple store and they can do some sort of patch (fix) that will make it okay.Frustrating!I routinely use my phone for business and need the VPN so I resorted to using my old iphone 6 for as long as that worked and now mysteriously it isn't accepting the VPN anymore either. UGH!Technology is well and good but these power plays by big companies seeking to live off our digital fingerprint (and the info from it they can sell/use) gets old, and is really to the point of being flagrant.From the refurb aspect, it was good too, well packaged and came with all expected items.For the money involved it would be nice if the hardware it came with was brand, instead of off brand.",2021年6月2日 在美国审核

Great phone! Would buy again!,"Fantastic phone! Don’t be freaked out if when you go to your settings where it says network and it says “phone not allowed”.I got this phone as a replacement for my iPhone 8 and the battery was so bad it couldn’t be off of the charger for even 60 seconds without shutting down. I ordered it before Christmas so I had a long wait so when I finally got it I was so excited but when I went to the network settings it said “phone not allowed”. So then I go when I look it up online and it says some thing about how that typically can me and the phone was blacklisted because it was stolen which really freaked me out. But then I found another article online that said this also can happen if a phone is wiped or refurbished.

But if I had just believe that first article I wouldn’t have even bothered calling my wireless carrier. So if you end up having this problem don’t be alarmed I would absolutely buy a phone from this company again it was in perfect physical condition not one scratch or blemish anywhere which is something I was was worried about with buying a renewed phone.The only thing that I would warn against is if you do end up purchasing a phone and you get it and it is not up to your satisfaction you will not get any sort of a refund until the company that you purchased the phone from receives your phone and then from there it could be up to 10 days before you get said refund so when it comes to buying a refurbished phone keep that in mind.",2021年1月13日 在美国审核

Really great experience!,"Really great experience! I was completely sold by the storage space and sale price.

Set-up was a total breeze, and the easiest I’ve ever had to set-up a phone, so the value in that alone is huge. Everything got transferred over — settings, apps, data within the apps, etc. It came with a screen protector already applied, a generic charging cord + plug, and no headphones — but I already had chargers, and headphones from my previous phone.

esteticamente excelente pero ...,"Quiero comenzar diciendo, que esta resea es casi 1 mes despues de mi compra, y esto es lo que he obervado:PUNTOS POSITIVOS: esteticamente llego impecable, sin ningun rayón, funciona el faceid (solo que a veces es dificil que te reconozca), cargador y cable funcionan bien, el precio, en teoría le hacen un check up de 20 puntos de inspección, aunque ya me hizo dudar porque la batería no esta al 90% al menos.PUNTOS EN CONTRA: la batería llego al 89% (en la tarjetita dice que lo minimo que lo entregan es con 90%) por lo cual me dura menos de las 4 hrs de pantalla, ya se me apago una vez de la nada al estar utilizando la camara (esto si me hace sospechar de algun problema posterior, tendre que seguir monitoreandolo), y la seal del telefono es muy pobre, no se si esto sea un problema o asi sea con todos los Iphone X.Las camaras si estan muy justitas a comparación de los Iphone actuales (mod 12).Dejo esta resea como testigo del estado del telefono, esperando que en un futuro siga funcionando bien, sino tendré que apegarme a la garantía.",2021年3月25日 在墨西哥审核

Highly recommended,"I was very hesitant to buy a renewed iphone, especially off Amazon. But I was completely shocked and amazed on how extremely clean and brand new this iphone looked. There was absolutely no scratchs, no marks, no dust particles visible anywhere on the iPhone and no signs of usage. Apps and cameras work completely brand new. My iPhone 6s was giving me alot of problems such as randomly logging out of apps, randomly going to a black loading screen, not being able to answer phone calls and constantly having to restart the phone. So far with the iPhone x, there is no such problems I had with the iPhone 6s. I highly recommend.",2021年7月19日 在加拿大审核

Wahnsinns Teil!,"Sehr schnell, sehr groß und die Akkulaufzeit ho ho hoooo ;-) Wenn man WLAN und GPS nicht ständig aktiv hat, hält das Ding locker 4 Tage durch. Das ist der Hammer. Derart Laufzeit kannte ich zuletzt von meinem alten Tastenhandy. Auf dem Ding macht das surfen richtig Spaß aufgrund der Größe. Hatte kurz davor das HTC One X. Ich muss zugeben, daß dies in Punkto Design und grafische Aufmachung des Systems etwas schöner war. Aber durch einen Defekt musste ich es zurückschicken und Amazon hatte es nicht mehr auf Lager. Also bestellte ich mir dieses Schlachtschiff und bereue nichts. Man kann halt nicht alles auf einmal haben. Und die Größe, die dadurch bedingten Möglichkeiten und die enorme Akkulaufzeit sind für mich wertvoller als pures Design. Den Pen hab ich noch nie gebraucht. Kann ich nicht viel drüber sagen. Eröffnet aber sicher nen paar interessante Features. GPS funktioniert einwandfrei. Da hatte ich bei meinem alten Galaxy s einige Schwierigkeiten. Da gab es damals nen Serienfehler bei dem das GPS überhaupt nix mehr getaugt hat. Das hatte meinen Standpunkt überall im umkreis von 500 Metern lokalisiert. nur nicht da wo ich wirklich war. Dauernder GPS Abriss usw.... Beim Note 2 jetzt absolut präziese. Wlan funzt super. Sprachqualität astrein. Doch doch, kann ich wirklich empfehlen. Zumindest Leuten, die nen halben Tablet PC ihr neues Handy nennen möchten ;-)",2012年12月14日 在德国审核
Tolles Smartphone,"Nun, die vielen Vorteile wurden ja schon mehrfach aufgezählt und daher werde ich hier im wesentlichen die für mich persönlich nicht ganz so tollen Punkte herausstellen. Daher ist diese Bewertung mit Sicherheit nicht ganzheitlich objektiv.Und es bleibt zu betonen, das Note 2 ist ein echt geniales Teil, und hat eindeutig die 5 Sterne verdient.Zu Anfang trotz der Ankündigung von Nachteilen hier ein paar positive Punkte, meine persönlichen Highlights:+ Akkulaufzeit = erstaunlich!Wer bereits ein Smartphone hatte wird begeistert sein, dass der Akku auch bei intensiver Nutzung sehr lange hält. Ich hatte zuvor ein Sony X10, dort war es kaum möglich einen Tag mit intensiver Nutzung ohne Nachladen zu überstehen. Das Note 2 hält trotz Video schauen, MP3 hören, im Internet surfen, Mails schreiben, telefonieren einen vollen Tag durch.+ Transport = tragbar!Ich hatte etwas Bedenken... stört diese Größe im Alltag beim Transport?Nach einem Tag war ich erstaunt wie gut sich das Smartphone ""versteckt"" wenn es nicht gebraucht wird. In einer Männer-Jeans-Hosentasche ist es beim gehen nicht negativ zu spüren und auch setzen geht ganz gut, aber bitte nicht in die hinteren Taschen stecken ;-)In der Jackentasche ist es eh kein Problem.+ Display = brillant!Das Display - und darum kauft man sich ja ein Note 2 - ist brillant. Die Helligkeit ist für den Alltag sehr gut. Die Auflösung hätte noch höher sein können, ist aber dennoch so gut, dass man eine volle Webseite lesen kann ohne besonders weit zoomen zu müssen. Was richtig Spaß macht ist das Video schauen - und durch das Display kann man auch mal zu zweit rein schauen.+ Stiftbedienung = effektiv!Das beste am Note 2 ist ja die Stiftbedienung.Ich schreibe mittlerweile alle meine Notizen nur noch über das Note.Vorteil: ich habe immer alles dabei.Die Auflösung und Geschwindigkeit reicht für ein halbwegs natürliches Schreibgefühl - wenn auch die glatte Oberfläche gewöhnungsbedürftig ist.Durch die Displaygröße hat man mehr Platz als auf einem üblichen Notizzettel.Ich nutze die App ""Papyrus"". Hier ist es möglich die Notizgröße zu definieren z.B. A4 und dann per zwei Finger Bewegung zu Zoomen und zu scrollen. Damit kann man trotz der Displaygröße komfortabel ganze A4 Notizen anfertigen.Die Notizen lege ich dann als PDF im Google Drive ab und kann von dort per PC aus zugreifen.Nun aber zu der Liste der für mich persönlich nicht ganz so glücklichen Dinge rund ums Note 2:- Die An/Aus TasteDas ist bestimmt Gewohnheit, aber ich empfinde die Position der An/Aus Taste als sehr unglücklich. Das Sony X10 hatte die Taste oben, damit hatte ich nie Probleme. Das Note hat diese Taste rechts an der Seite. Mir passiert es leider immer wieder, dass ich das Note 2 unabsichtlich ausschalte, weil ich beim Halten auf den Taster komme. Auch beim Verändern der Lautstärke kommt man auf den genau gegenüber der Lautstärke Wippe liegenden Ein/Aus Taster.- LautstärkeeinstellungDas Sony X10 war mir immer zu leise. Das Note 2 ist schon deutlich lauter - das ist auch super. Nur leider ist die Differenzierung der Lautstärke im unteren Bereich sehr grob. Wenn man also nur sehr leise Musik hören will gibt es nur zwei Stellungen ""aus"" oder ""nicht wirklich leise"".- Notizen als durchsuchbares PDFNun zum für mich wirklich größten Nachteil, obwohl es nicht wirklich ein direkter Nachteil des Note 2 ist sondern eher der Nachteil einer fehlenden Software Lösung. Meine Hoffnung war, dass ich meine Notizen - und das war ja einer meiner Kaufgründe - als handschriftlich dargestelltes, aber gleichzeitig durchsuchbares PDF ablegen kann.Nun, die mitgelieferte Notiz Applikation S Note kann das schon mal nicht. Also geht man im Google Play Store mal suchen - leider war das für mich bisher ohne Erfolg. Die einzige Möglichkeit, die ich fand ein handschriftlich durchsuchbares PDF zu bekommen ist Evernote. Leider bietet diese App aber keinen Editor für handschriftliche Notizen an. D.h. man muss eine Handschrift-Notiz-App nutzen und dann zu Evernote exportieren. Aber irgendwie ist das alles nicht sehr durchgängig. Das Telefon hat ja eine Handschrifterkennung eingebaut - es sollte eigentlich ein leichtes sein während dem Schreiben im Hintergrund die Worte zu erkennen (bei Mehrdeutigkeit eben alle Möglichkeiten) und daraus ein PDF zu machen, welches im Hintergrund die erkannten Worte hat um danach indiziert suchen zu können.Naja, mal sehen, es gibt ein paar, die wohl daran arbeiten - ich hätte mir das eigentlich von Samsung direkt gewünscht.- S NoteKurz zu S Note. Ich finde das Programm nicht sehr glücklich. Es bietet zwar einige nette Features. Aber es benötigt z.B. beim Start recht lange bis man endlich schreiben darf. Eine Notizapp sollte mir sofort nach Start zum Notieren zur Verfügung stehen und nicht erst eine Auswahl der Vorlage aufzwingen - das sollte einstellbar sein (oder hab ich hier etwas übersehen?)- S PlanerInsgesamt eine sehr gut gelungene App. Ich nutze den Google Kalender und alles wird gut dargestellt. Leider kann man die handschriftlichen Notizen nicht auf dem PC im Browser sehen. Aber das liegt ja wohl eher an Google. Da wäre ein Browser Plugin perfekt - keine Ahnung wo die Notizen gespeichert werden. (auch hier wäre ich über Infos ob es doch irgendwie geht dankbar)- Stift TasterDer Stift hat eine Taste. Diese wird benutzt um Text zu markieren. Es wäre cool, wenn man die Funktion hier frei konfigurieren könnte. Also z.B. ein Move. Damit wäre das schreiben von Notizen noch komfortabler.- USBBei meinem Sony wurde nach Anschließen des USB Kabels an den PC der Massenspeichemodus genutzt. Nachteil: das Phone kann selbst nicht mehr auf die SD-Karte zugreifen. Vorteil: das geht an jedem PC, auch mit einem Windows XP ohne zusätzliche Treiberinstallation. Das Note 2 hat diese Möglichkeit nicht, es verbindet sich über den MTP Modus. Vorteil: das Smartphone kann gleichzeitig auf den Speicher zugreifen. Nachteil: bei alten XP Installationen ist ein Treiber erforderlich. [Warum Samsung die Option wie beim S2 herausgenommen hat manuell auf den Massenspeichermodus umzuschalten - keine Ahnung].Dank einem Kommentar muss ich zur Ehrenrettung von Samsung meine Rezension korrigieren:Der UMS (USB-Massenspeicher Modus) ist wohl bei allen Android Versionen ab Ice Cream Sandwich weggefallen. Somit ist es eher ein Nachteil von Android und ich müsste die Frage nach dem ""Warum?"" an Google richten. (Danke an ""Gekritzel"" für den Hinweis.)Und laut einem anderen Kommentar gibt es wohl Android Apps, die einen UMS Modus erlauben. Das werde ich sicherlich demnächst mal testen. (Danke an ""Ralf Meis"" für den Hinweis.)Kurz noch ein paar Details zu MTP und UMS Modus:Der Unterschied ist im Wesentlichen dass es XP Installationen gibt, welche ohne zusätzliche Software nichts mit dem vom Note 2 verwendeten MTP Modus anfangen können. D.h. sitzt man vor solch einem Rechner und will kurz auf die Dateien des Note 2 zugreifen muss man zunächst einen Treiber installieren.Dies betrifft nur XP Installationen ohne Windows Media Player 10. D.h. für alle, die eh nur mit Win7 oder Win8 zu tun haben ist dies kein Nachteil. Ich war nun schon zweimal in der Lage an einem System zu sitzen, welches eine alte XP Installation hatte und war etwas genervt, dass ich nicht wie gewohnt einfach auf die Daten zugreifen konnte.Der UMS Modus, wie z.B. bei meinem alten Sony X10 emuliert eine externe Festplatte. Somit kann jede XP Installation von Haus aus ohne zusätzliche Treiber auf die Inhalte des Smartphones zugreifen.Nachteil bei dieser Variante: üblicherweise kann das Smartphone während es mit dem PC kontaktiert ist nicht auf die Daten zugreifen, dies ist beim MTP Modus besser gelöst.Gut, soweit mal. Und nochmals der Hinweis, das Gerät ist trotz der Punkte oben ein absolut geniales Smartphone. Und wer weiß, vielleicht gibt es ja für den einen oder anderen Punkt Lösungen, die ich noch nicht kenne - ich bin gespannt!",2012年12月4日 在德国审核

"Note 2, aso das soll groß sein","also vielleicht am ersten Tag, dass man empfunden hat, dass dieses Handy groß ist, aber danach hat man nur das Gefühl das alle anderen winzig sind.Sogar viele Vorteile enstehen durch die Größe:o)beim Telefonieren ist das Mikro wieder beim Mund anstatt an der Wange.o) man braucht keine Brille zum lesen,....Das Plastik stört mich nicht, finde eher das man bei Plastik nicht so den Verschleiß sieht. Hab nen Walkman von sony der schaut jetzt nach 6 Wochen derartig beschädigt aus weil aus Metall.und mein Galaxy S hatte genauso die Plastikteile und funkt noch immer supi.Ja sicher am Anfang hab ich mir auch gedacht uh ist das dünn, trotzdem der Rückteil hat dadurch Vorteile( meine Meinung)Und die Argumente, dass manche sagen uh das ist aber billig(für mich gleichzusetzen mit nicht lang haltbar) gegenüber dem Iphone --&gt; mein Galaxy S hat schon manches Iphone von Freunden überlebt, und ist mir sehr oft heruntergefallen.

Es gibt immer eine Steigerung,"Mein erstes Android Handy war das Galaxy S2 und ich war damals begeistert. Ebenso bin ich begeistert vom Galaxy Note 2. Es gibt nicht wirklich etwas zu meckern, nur auf hohem Niveau. Trotz Android 4.1 und Project Butter scrollt man immer noch nicht ganz ruckelfrei, obwohl genug Rechenpower da ist. Das Note 2 könnte auch etwas schneller auf den S-Pen bei handschriftlicher Eingabe reagieren, halt so als wenn man auf echtes Papier schreibt. Das ist aber auch schon alles, denn der Rest ist perfekt. Das Note 2 hat so viele Funktionen das man sich Tage damit beschäftigen kann bis man alles durch hat. Ich denke die meißten werden nur an der Oberfläche dessen kratzen, was man machen kann. Gehäuse und Design sehen in der Grau-Blauen Variante sehr schick aus, auch wenn ich eigentlich lieber ein schwarzes gehabt hätte. Was das Thema mit der Größe angeht. Für mich war gerade die Größe ein Kaufargument und es liegt sehr gut in der Hand. Wer große Hände hat schafft es sogar noch es mit einer Hand zu bedienen. Allerdings kann es dann leicht herunterfallen. In gängige Hosentaschen passt es auch hinein, nur beim hinsetzen stört es etwas. Aber ich bin sicher das Note 3 hat dann ein faltbares Display ;)",2012年11月3日 在德国审核
Mehr Smartphone geht nicht,"Gehäuse öffnen und Akku einlegen...geht gut und schnell. Negativ der recht dünn wirkende Gehäusedeckel aus Plastik.Sim einlegen...wäre kein Problem, so man MicroSim hat. Hatte ich nicht, aber eine Schere. Einfach die Simkarte beschnitten, einschieben, fertig. Verbindungsqualität bei Sprache und Daten ist sicherlich providerabhängig, das Note 2 macht aber auf jeden Fall das beste draus. Konnte ich direkt vergleichen mit einem Smartphone eines anderen Herstellers.OLED-Display...wunderbare Farben blinkwinkelunabhängig. Sehr empfindlicher Screen, nicht gegen Kratzer sondern bei Berührung. Manchmal reagiert er schon, bevor ich überhaupt selbst eine Berührung merke.Der Stift, endlich ist ein Steckplatz standardmäßig wieder da, ist wirklich ein guter Helfer. Erkennung einwandfrei.Der Quadcore-Prozessor scheint nicht einmal annähernd an seine Grenzen zu kommen. Spiele, Videos, Multiwindows...alles absolut ruckelfrei.Netzteil ist schön stark, so dass das Laden recht zügig geht. Nehme ich jetzt auch für andere Geräte, bei dennen das Netzteil eher eine Sparversion war.Software...Samsung hat seine Apps schon drauf und Google natürlich auch. Einiges ist doppelt und kann weg. Mittels Root und entsprechender App kann man hier sehr gut aufräumen. Rooten aber auf eigene Gefahr!WLAN, BT, USB...schön schnell. Keine Qualitätsprobleme bei der Übertragung.16 GB Speicher, davon 10 GB nutzbar. Wahnsinn. Ich habe bei der Samsungaktion mitgemacht (läuft noch) und eine 64 GB Karte gratis dazubekommen. Welches Smartphone erkennt eine 64 GB Karte? Nicht viele!

Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - eine gute Wahl !,"Sicherlich hatten auch andere Käufer des Note2 die besonders schwierige Entscheidung zu treffen - Galaxy S3 oder Note2 ?Beide sind technisch fast gleichwertig und auf der Höhe der Zeit.Telefonieren, Videos filmen, Bilder knipsen, ansehen, Radio oder MP3- Musik hören - hier ist das handliche Galaxy S3mehr als bestens geeignet.Wenn man aber unterwegs im Internet surft, Mails abruft usw. ist es angenehmer in ein größeres Display zu schauen!Ich habe vor dem Kauf mehrmals beide Geräte nebeneinander angesehen, in die Hand genommen und mich wiederholternsthaft gefragt - was will ich hauptsächlich damit machen!Das Note 2 hat einige Funktionen (S-Pen) die nur dieses Gerät hat und dieses Extra bewog mich letztendlich zum Kauf.Ein Bekannter hat das Galaxy S3 und ist hochzufrieden damit, ich bin aber jetzt nach dem Vergleichen unserer Geräteim nachhinein mehr als zufrieden, daß ich mich für das Note2 entschieden habe.Für mich ist das Note2 das bessere Smartphon und kein aufgeblasenes S3!In meine Hemdtasche passt es immer noch!Ohnehin geht der Trend zu immer größeren Displays.Das Galaxy S4 kommt im April und im September das neue, noch größere Note3!Wer nutzt sein Smartphon eigentlich grundsätzlich nur einhändig?Ich habe noch das Samsung Wave3, erst gut 1 Jahr alt, kleiner als das S3 oder Note2, trotzdem benötige ich zum Eingeben von Daten usw. immer beide Hände.Somit hat sich die Frage wegen der größeren Abmessungen des Note2 erledigt.Fazit nach einer Woche Nutzung: ein prächtiges Stück Technik !!",2013年3月25日 在德国审核

Me imagino que hubiera pasado.....En fin agradecido a Amazon por su buen hacer y su exquisita atención teléfonica.Esperemos que el problema no se repita, por que Amazon solo cumple durante los 30 primeros días, luego al servicio técnico del fabricante.Por lo que aconsejo que mientras dueren los 30 días ""den caña"" a lo que compren, al menos si ha de fallar que lo haga en este período, luego sería esperar al SAT del fabricante.Por cierto samsung tiene un chat de servicio técnico al que le expliqué el caso y a la pregunta de si mencionado problema era habitual o si tiene solución fácil, las respuestas: no le consta, devolver a quien se lo vendió que ya se lo enviarán a samsung.Repito gracias a Amazon por su servicio.&gt;Por cierto el teléfono un gran aparato en lo poco que lo usé.SaludosP.D.

"TOP Handy, perfekte Größe!","Hier nur die Punkte, die nicht schon in den hervorragenden Rezisionen des Handys genannt wurden:Positives:+ Akkulaufzeit gefällt mir sehr gut, gefühlt 40-50% länger als beim S2.+ Man kann den Energiesparmodus aktivieren, welcher den Prozessor drosselt und merkt _kaum_ einen unterschied.Die 4 Kerne sind auch im Energiesparmodus zum Surfen / Mailen / Facebook / Youtube schnell genug!Im Energiesparmodus läuft das Handy merklich länger.Negatives- Der S-Pen funktioniert nicht auf den Sensor-Tasten unten. Das ist der größe Kritikpunkt! Man muss dieStift-Bedienung immer wieder unterbrechen um mit einem Finger auf die zurück-Taste zu drücken. DasNervt sehr!- Der Rand um das Handy und der Rand um die Kamera (worauf das Handy aufliegt, wenn es auf dem Rücken liegt)sind kratzempfindlich.- Das Aufladen des Akkus per USB (500mA) dauert eine Gefühlte Ewigkeit!Ansonsten: Keine Angst vor der Größe!

Geniale Technik mit schwachem Gehäuse,"Ich habe das Note jetzt einige Zeit in ständiger Benutzung und bin nach wie vor begeistert!Herrlich intuitive und königlich bequeme Funktionen und Bedienung! Es ist bisher mein bestes Smartphone.Auch heute noch entdecke ich staunend neue Funktionen. Es ist ein genialer Begleiter mit einem sehr guten Akku, bzw. langer Laufzeit. Bei vollem Programm hält das Note bei mir bis zu drei Tagen ohne Steckdose aus. Das mag wenig erscheinen, ist es aber nicht, wenn man die Display-Größe bedenkt und dass in seinem Herzen ein hochleistungsfähiger 1,6GHz Quadcore Prozessor schlägt. Bei normaler Nutzung hält der Akku locker eine Woche.Es gibt kaum etwas, dass mit dem Note nicht erledigt werden kann. Sogar Festplatten können mit einem Adapterkabel angeschlossen und bedient werden, bei YouTube findet man interessante Videos mit weiteren Möglichkeiten. Von der Leistung her ein absolutes Arbeitstier und flinker als mein Laptop.Meine absolute Begeisterung schmälert leider ein kleines Qualitätsmangel mit dem Gehäuse... Der Rahmen, der um das Display verläuft hat sich mittlerweile verformt und es ist dadurch ein Spalt zum Display entstanden, in dem sich Staub ansammelt. Wenn das noch schlimmer wird, werde ich das reklamieren.Was noch schade ist, das ist der sehr kratzanfällige Deckel (Rückseite), der mittlerweile ziemlich zerkratzt ist.

Aber genau richtig so!,"Zuerst das Negative:Zum reinen Telefonieren ist dieses ""Handy"" zu groß!Zum reinen Arbeiten wie mit einem Notebook ist dieses Tablet zu klein!Nun das Positive:Wer ein Gerät sucht, mit dem man unterwegs arbeiten und auch noch telefonieren kann, und dabei nicht zwei oder gar drei Geräte mit sich herumschleppen will, liegt bei dem Note 2 genau richtig.Ich habe den Kauf noch nicht eine Minute bereut, auch wenn meine Arbeitskollegen zu mir immer sagen, dass ich mit einer ""Mobilen Telefonzelle"" rumlaufe. Wer mit solchen Kommentaren leben kann und einen universellen Alleskönner haben möchte, dem kann ich das Note 2 nur empfehlen.",2013年5月1日 在德国审核
Riesig und einfach super!,"Mein erstes Smartphone, und dann gleich so ein Brocken! Ich habe lange hin und her überlegt, ob das Note 2 nicht zu groß ist für das tägliche Mit-sich-herumtragen. Aber es passt trotzdem in die meisten meiner Handtaschen und sogar viele Jackentaschen. Und das riesige, klare Display ist einfach eine Wonne für gestresste Augen. Mit dem Stift lassen sich Nachrichten superschnell schreiben, denn nach kurzer ""Lernzeit"" erkennt das Gerät fast alle Wörter auf Anhieb. Sogar die Anfängerschreibschrift meiner neunjährigen Tochter kann es problemlos entziffern. Ich habe noch gar nicht alle Möglichkeiten ausgelotet, aber es macht einfach Spaß, damit zu arbeiten. Meine Tochter liebt es, Fotos per Stift zu ""verzieren"". Einziges Manko bislang: Fotos mit Blitz sind farblich irgendwie verfälscht. Ich arbeite in Innenräumen mit der Einstellung ""wenig Licht"", dann geht es. Habe mir eine schickes, schmales Flip Case von Avanto (""Wallet"") dazugekauft, denn eine Folie auf dem Display wollte ich auf keinen Fall. Die billige Plastik-Rückabdeckung liegt jetzt in der Schublade. Fazit: Ich würde mich jederzeit wieder für das Note 2 entscheiden!",2013年1月5日 在德国审核
Das beste auf dem Markt,"Hallo! Bin vor ein paar Wochen vom S3 auf das Note 2 umgestiegen und bereue diesen Schritt in keinster Weise.Die Auflösung ist nicht merklich schlechter, bei.5,5"" würden sich aber 1080p lohnen. Die CPU ist echt der Hammer und bringt mit den 2gb RAM deutlich mehr Leistung als das S3.Richtig gut finde ich auch die Mutliwindowfunktion und natürlich den Spen- durch den man einfach noch mehr Möglichkeiten hat.

Ich habe es nicht bereut.Die Akkulaufzeit ist sogar noch besser als beim S3, das Display einsame Spitze. Tolles Gerät ist der S-Pen, der zuverlässig funktioniert.

Auch im Alter noch immer ein Knaller (und im Vergleich zu meinem LG G2),"Nachdem ich kürzlich für längere Zeit mein LG G2 nicht zur Hand hatte habe ich wieder mein ""altes"" Note 2 (behalten als Backup Hand) zur Hand genommen. Was soll ich sagen. Mein G2 ist wieder da und ich benutze immer noch das Note 2. Das hat mich dazu verleitet eine kurze Rezension zu schreiben.Das Note 2 ist in technischer Hinsicht natürlich schon ""veraltet"". Dafür hat es aber noch immer so einiges auf dem Kasten. Ich habe es damals für 550€ gekauft und die jetzigen rund 350€ sind meiner Meinung nach noch immer angemessen. Das Display ist eine wirklich Freude. Natürlich ist FullHD schon schärfer, aber nicht zwingend notwendig. Youtube Videos etc machen auf dem Display einfach mehr Spaß als auf einem kleineren Display.Auch die Performance hat mich sehr überrascht. Das Note 2 steht dem G2 in gar nichts nach. Die meisten Apps starten gleich schnell, manche Spiele (Plants vs Zombies, Temple Run) starten auf dem Note sogar merkbar schneller.Die Vorteile des Stylus, und das MULTITASKING, das auch wirklich eins ist und man 2 Apps gleichzeitig offen haben kann sparen mir nicht nur im Alltag sondern auch im Job immer mal wieder viel Zeit ein.Die Kamera ist immer noch eine sehr gute. Die Qualität hat sich in den neueren Geneationen mehr in den MP gesteigert, jedoch wenig in der eigentlich Fotoqualität. Bei Fotos am Tag ist kein Unterschied auszumachen.Der Klang von MP3s erscheint mit am Note 2 auch besser als vom LG G2 (Kopfhörer sind die Parrot Zik und Bose Soundtrue AE)Wer nicht die neuste Generation benötigt bekommt hier immer noch ein Hammer Handy, dass immer noch Spaß macht und selbst den meisten ""modernen"" Handys, zumindest fühlbar, in nichts nachsteht. Der einzig kleine Nachteil ist das wippen der Rückseite, möchte man auf dem Note schreiben während es auf dem Rücken liegt. Das liegt am Akkudeckel. Ich habe mir 2 andere gekauft die das Problem gelöst haben. Einen mit Lederoberfläche für mehr Grip im Winter und ein edles aus Aluminium (kühlt schon im Sommer (http://www.amazon.de/wortek-Akkudeckel-Backcover-Aluminium-geb%C3%BCrstet/dp/B00CP2UTCU/ref=sr_1_1?s=ce-de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409843300&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=wortek+akkudeckel+note+2)Immer noch eine volle Kaufempfehlung.",2014年9月4日 在德国审核

Das Display ist brillant, die Kamera macht sehr gute Aufnahmen, die Bedienung ist fast selbsterklärend, die Schrifterkennung mit dem S-Pen ist phänomenal (überhaupt die ganzen Funktionen des Stiftes), die Funktionen sind gut durchdacht, der Prozessor ist sehr schnell und bringt mehr als genügend Leistung.Anfangs war die Umgewöhnung auf ein Gerät diesen Ausmaßes zwar ein wenig schwierig - das ergab sich aber mit der Zeit.Fazit: Rundum zufrieden",2013年1月18日 在德国审核

Galaxy Note II - das Ding dazwischen,"Ich bin eher der konservative und stationäre Typ: am liebsten arbeite ich immer am gleichen PC und mit einer Tastatur, die schon richtig schön eingetippert ist - eine neue Tastatur ist mir ein Gräuel.Im Laufe diesen Jahres musste ich mich zunehmend umstellen: zwei parallele Arbeitsplätze, eine Nutzung des Notebooks nicht nur bei Schulungen sowie Präsentationen sondern auch für den Support von unterwegs aus. Dazu kamen verstärkt virtuelle Maschinen und Remote Desktop Verbindungen zum Einsatz, gleichzeitig stieg die Zahl der Aufgaben und Besprechungen im Team spürbar an.Vertrat ich Anfang des Jahres noch die Position: ""Tablet? Nee, wozu denn?"" und ""E-Mails auf dem Handy? Ohne mich!"" war ich im Herbst soweit, dass ich mir ein Android Tablet zulegte (Galaxy Tab 2 - 7.0). Es ging mir vor allem darum, bei Besprechungen rasch und bequem alle Informationen zur Verfügung zu haben und möglichst direkt über das Tablet zu dokumentieren - um mir den Zwischenschritt über ein Blatt Papier zu ersparen. Erste Erkenntnis: ein Tablet ist ein Tablet und kein PC - Protokolle über den Bildschirm des Tablets einzutippen ist mühsam. Ergo musste eine Bluetooth Tastatur dazu. Echt bescheuert, mein Rucksack wurde immer schwerer. Es wurde nicht einfacher sondern komplizierter.Unterm Strich kein Zugewinn. Mit einer Ausnahme: mit dem Tablet haben eBooks endgültig Einzug in mein Leben gehalten. Nicht nur für Fachliteratur, auch die leichte Lektüre - inzwischen schätze ich es z.B. in der S-Bahn zu sitzen und zu lesen, ein Buch würde ich nicht mit rumschleppen. Ich bilde mir ein, ich lese sogar mehr als vorher. Mit meinem Kindle bin ich dagegen nie so recht warm geworden.Zufrieden war ich also nicht. Wollte aber noch nicht aufgeben. Bereits während der Entscheidung für das Tablet hatte ich mir auch das Galaxy Note angesehen (noch das I, das II war angekündigt aber noch nicht verfügbar), entschied mich aber für das Tablet. Zum Glück, die Erfahrung die ich sammeln durfte war wertvoll!Nach dem ganzen Frust reduzierte ich meine Anforderungen auf folgende Punkte:* ich möchte ein einziges Gerät für meinen mobilen Bedarf haben, nicht mehrere!* Stifteingabe! Mit der Hand schreiben und eine Schrifterkennung dazu!Es gibt nur ein einziges Gerät das darauf passt: das Galaxy Note II von Samsung.Probier's einfach aus, sagte ich mir.Gesagt, getan.Leute, dieses Ding dazwischen isses! Ich habe bestimmt keine einfache Handschrift, aber das Galaxy kommt damit sehr gut zurecht, auf Anhieb! Die Kombination von Stifteingabe, Schrifterkennung und einer Größe zwischen einem Smartphone und einem Tablet ist genial. Mit 5,5 Zoll ist das Display gerade groß genug, damit man flüssig und ermüdungsfrei darauf lesen kann. Gleichzeitig ist es an der Schmerzgrenze dessen, was man sich zum Telefonieren noch ans Ohr halten möchte und es passt auch noch in die Hosentasche einer Jeans. OK - ich hatte vorher ein HTC One S und war von daher schon ein etwas größeres Telefon gewöhnt. Wer direkt von einem eher kleinen Smartphone auf das Note II umsteigt hat möglicherweise ein paar Probleme sich an das Format und Gewicht zu gewöhnen.Innerhalb von ein paar Tagen hat sich das Note II als Allrounder bei mir etabliert. Die Entscheidung, das Note II zu behalten und dafür das HTC One S sowie das Galaxy Tab 2 - 7.0 zu verkaufen fiel mir sehr leicht und sie fiel rasch.Es gibt ein paar Dinge, da ist das Note II einfach unschlagbar: Du stehst irgendwo und willst etwas notieren? Handy raus, Stift rausziehen, es poppt trotz Bildschirmsperre sofort ein Notizblock auf und ist bereit zur Eingabe. Entweder frei Hand drauf los schreiben oder ein wenig disziplinierter, einen Tick langsamer mit Schrifterkennung. Schneller und unmittelbarer geht es kaum.E-Mails lesen auf dem Smartphone? Konnte ich mir nicht vorstellen. Auf dem Note II kann ich meine Mails problemlos lesen, markieren und sortieren. Antworten ist auch kein Problem: da ist er wieder, der Stift, der Sieger über die Bildschirmtastatur ... 8-)Das Note II kann noch ein paar Dinge mehr, die ich inzwischen schätze: HDMI Kabel ran und das Note II versteht sich mit jedem Beamer oder Bildschirm. Per HDMI lässt sich das Note II auch wunderbar mit meinem Netz-Receiver koppeln und entwickelt beeindruckende Entertainment Qualitäten in einem astreinen Sound.Kurz: ich habe das Galaxy Note II ständig in den Fingern und setze es so intensiv ein, wie noch kein anderes mobiles Gerät zuvor.Gibt es auch einen Haken?Bei aller Begeisterung: ja, den gibt es. Sogar zwei:* Das Note II braucht eine Menge Strom. Unter Last und bei gleichzeitig angeschlossenem Netzkabel kann das Note den Ladestand gerade so halten. Aufladen ist praktisch nur möglich, wenn das Galaxy nicht aktiv genutzt wird.* Die automatische Helligkeitsregulierung taugt nix. Sie ist viel zu dunkel eingestellt und lässt sich leider nicht justieren. Hier sollte Samsung dringend nacharbeiten, denn der Bildschirm ist der Großverbraucher beim Note...Trotzdem: uneingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung!",2012年12月22日 在德国审核
Ein gelungener Nachfolger,"Moin. Ich habe das Note 2 jetzt seit einigen Tagen und möchte nun auch meine Meinung zu dem Gerät äußern. Ich hatte vorher das Note 1 und vergleiche deshalb primär beide Geräte miteinander, da viele potenzielle Note-1-Nutzer eventuell vor der Entscheidung stehen, sich das Note 2 zuzulegen. Da es im Internet bereits ausführliche Tests, Benchmarks und alle möglichen Daten zu dem Smartphone gibt, versuche ich mich kurz zu halten und auf die Punkte einzugehen, die ich am Note 2 gut finde und die mich weniger überzeugen.Was mich an dem Gerät überzeugt:+ Die Hardware ist aktuell und vor allem sehr schnell. Apps und alle möglichen Dateien werden sehr schnell geladen und absolut flüssig dargestellt. Sogar anspruchsvollere PDF-Dateien mit vielen Bildern und Texten (z. B. das GameStar-Magazin) werden nun wesentlich schneller scharf dargestellt als noch mit dem Note 1, wenn auch noch immer nicht perfekt. Auch ist das Scrollen durch längere Listen sowie das Zoomen in große Bilder und im Internetbrowser wesentlich angenehmer und flotter. Einzig beim Go Launcher stottert die Darstellung noch, wobei mir jedoch kein Gerät bekannt ist, bei dem das anders wäre. Die Geschwindigkeit vom Note 2 ist klasse und für einige sicherlich ein Grund, umzusteigen. Der Unterschied ist meines Erachtens absolut spürbar.+ Der Stift ist jetzt etwas dicker und liegt somit besser in der Hand. Zudem gibt die Mine bei Druck etwas nach und verbessert so das Schreibgefühl. Auch lässt sich durch die Bauart der Knopf für die Gesten jetzt wesentlich einfacher finden (selbst ohne Licht). Am meisten gefällt mir aber der Druckpunkt, der mit dem neuen Stift deutlich besser geworden ist. Beim Note 1 musste man aus meiner Sicht zu stark aufdrücken, was auf Dauer etwas anstregend werden konnte. Zudem wurden die Aktionen zum Teil nicht erkannt, weil der Druck nicht groß genug war. Beim Note 2 werden die Eingaben durch den Stift durch minimalen Druck so umgesetzt, wie ich es mir gewünscht hatte. So macht das Arbeiten mit dem Note 2 glatt doppelt soviel Spaß. Ich muss aber auch erwähnen, dass ich das Gerät fast ausschließlich mit dem Stift bediene, da ich kein Fan von Fettfingern bin und den PDA-Flair einfach mag. Wem die Stiftfunktion also nicht so wichtig ist, kann diesen Punkt also überspringen.+ Das Display ist wie vom Vorgänger bekannt wieder sehr scharf und kontrastreich. Da das Note 2 auf die PenTile-Matrix verzichtet, werden vor allem graue Farbtöne jetzt ohne die zum Teil nervigen Abstufungen angezeigt. Dies wurde noch beim Vorgänger kritisiert, wobei ich auch das Display des Note 1 sehr gut fand. Im direkten Vergleich fällt auf, dass auf manchen Bildern der Bildschirm vom Note 2 tatsächlich etwas kontrastreicher und natürlicher wirkt. Aber das ist eben auch alles Ansichtssache. Auch begrüße ich den Umstieg vom 16:10- auf das 16:9-Format, wodurch Videos und Bilder in dieser Auflösung nun ohne die schwarzen Balken am Rand dargestellt werden. In der heutigen Zeit macht dieses Format natürlich absolut Sinn.+ Die Griffigkeit ist meiner Meinung nach deutlich besser geworden. Das Note 1 lag mir teilweise etwas zu rutschig in der Hand. Das Note 2 ist durch die geringere Breite nun griffiger und durch die Akkuabdeckung wesentlich rutschresistenter.+ Die Akkuleistung ist besser als die des Vorgängers. Aber auch hier merkt man, wie das normale Arbeiten die Energie verbraucht. Das ist aber nun mal bei jedem Smartphone so und noch immer ein großer Kritikpunkt. Trotzdem hält das Note 2 gut und vor allem länger durch.+ Es überzeugt mich zwar nicht unbedingt alles, aber das Note 2 hat jetzt einige Komfortfunktionen zusätzlich spendiert bekommen. Ich bin zwar kein Fan von dem ganzen Kram, aber wirklich gut finde ich die Anzeige an der Vorderseite, die bei ungelesenen Benachrichtigungen blau blinkt. So macht einen das Gerät auf Neuigkeiten wie neue E-Mails oder SMSen aufmerksam, ohne dass man es aktiv benutzt.Es gibt aber auch einige Dinge, die ich weniger gut finde.- Das Gerät wird zum Beispiel nicht als USB-Massenspeicher erkannt, was diverse Nachteile hat.So werden zum Beispiel Bilder vom Smartphone im Vorschaufenster auf dem Rechner nicht angezeigt und müssen zum Betrachten geöffnet werden.- Das Display ist zwar toll, aber eben auch nicht sonderlich hell. Hat man zum Beispiel einen besonders weißen Hintergrund, dann kann man das ganz gut erkennen.- Auch ist die Verarbeitung des Gerätes eher gewöhnlich. Der Stift kommt sogar richtig billig rüber und wirkt eher wie ein Gimmick aus dem YPS-Heft. Zudem ist der Spalt am Displayrand anfällig für Staub. Allgemein wirkt das Gerät zwar solide, aber eben auch sehr plastikhaft und zum Beispiel beim Akkudeckel richtig billig.- Auch verstehe ich nicht, weshalb zu einem grauen Gerät ein weißes Headset und Ladegerät sowie Kabel mitgeliefert werden. Zudem wird bei meinem Note 2 die USB-Verbindung mit dem mitgelieferten Kabel ständig unterbrochen, wenn ich das Smartphone in die Hand nehme. Mit einem anderen Micro-USB-Kabel läuft hingegen alles ohne Probleme.Alles in allem ist das Note 2 ein würdiger Nachfolger. Am meisten wird man sich über die spürbar bessere Geschwindigkeit freuen. Die anderen Verbesserungen sind zwar nett und logisch, aber eben auch absoluter Luxus. Wer mit seinem Note 1 zufrieden ist, muss nicht umsteigen. Wer dagegen das Aktuellste haben möchte und Wert auf eine gute Geschwindigkeit legt, kann bedenkenlos zugreifen.",2012年11月4日 在德国审核

Mehr als zufriedenstellend,"Hallo,ich Besitze das Handy schon seit ca. 1 Monat und bin restlos begeistert.Aber bevor ich das Handy gekauft habe. War ich sehr skeptisch wegen der Größe. (ist wahrscheinlich einer der häufigsten Gründe beim Note 2). Hab 2 Wochen zum überlegen gebraucht ob ich mir das Handy kaufen soll. Naja dann ist es geschehen. Lieferung kam ziemlich schnell (2 Tage). Es war am ersten Anblick schon sehr groß. Ich hatte davor das Samsung Galaxy S2 gehabt. Aber nach 1 Woche hab ich mich an die Größe gewöhnt. Sogar das S3 von meine Mutter kommt mir jetzt schon klein vor, weil ich einfach gewohnt war etwas großes in meiner Hand zu halten. Und wenn ich das IPhone 4 von meine Freundin halte finde ich es echt schon winzig xDARBEITIm Arbeitsleben fragt man sich, ob man sowas überhaupt mit sich tragen kann, ohne das es stört.

"Gelungener Wechsel von Apple zu Android, von iPhone 5 zum Note 2!","Lange hat es gedauert, immer wieder habe ich es versucht und nie konnten mich andere Smartphones von Apple abbringen.Mit dem Galaxy Note 2 ist dieses Kunststück nun doch endlich gelungen.Android ist inzwischen sehr ausgereift und steht iOS in nichts mehr nach. Die Bedienung ist nicht unbedingt komplizierter, sondern einfach vielfältiger. Man hat halt mehr Möglichkeiten. Wer vom Apple-Lager kommt, muss sich da schon erst mal umstellen, aber wirklich vermissen wird man nichts.Nachdem ich zwei Tage in den Umstieg investiert habe und alle Apps, Daten, Kontakte auf das Note 2 übertragen hatte (sofern möglich), gab es seit dem kein Bedürfnis mehr, das iPhone in die Hand zu nehmen. Dass es so einfach wird, hätte ich nicht gedacht. Bereits eine Woche später habe ich das Applegerät zurück gegeben. Bis dato (und das ist nun schon einige Monate her!) vermisse ich es überhaupt nicht.Die Gründe für dieses Smartphone sind insbesondere:- Akkulaufzeit: An einem Tag bekommt man den Akku eigentlich nicht mehr leer. Die meisten Nutzer dürften wohl auch ohne Weiteres 2-3 Tage schaffen. Das ist einfach herrlich. Beim iPhone (egal ob 4, 4S oder 5) habe ich stets Probleme gehabt, den Akku über einen Tag zu retten, der länger als 8 Stunden geht... Einer der größten Pluspunkte für mich!- S-Pen: Er war der Grund, warum es nicht das Galaxy S3 wurde. Ich finde den Stift einfach klasse. Man kann mal eben schnell beim Telefonieren oder unterwegs eine handschriftliche Notiz hinkrakeln, was mir manchmal lieber ist, als mit der Tastatur rumzutippen. Außerdem lassen sich Bilder und Screenshots ein wenig bearbeiten, kommentieren, usw., was bei der ein oder anderen Email schon hilfreich war. Probleme lassen sich so einfach besser klären. Wie heißt es so schön: Ein Bild sagt mehr als 1000 Worte!Übrigens: Texte, wie SMS und Email schreibe ich gelegentlich auch mit dem Stift. Funktioniert beängstigend gut,... selbst die größte Sauklaue wird meist fehlerfrei erkannt.- Leistung: Im Gerät ackert ein Quadcore-Prozessor. Das merkt man natürlich. Und das wiederum bietet tolle Möglichkeiten. Gerade bei dem großen Display lassen sich bequem zwei Anwendungen parallel darstellen (z. B. Emailprogramm + Browser, was durchaus eine sinnvolle Kombination darstellt). Besonders toll ist z. B. auch bei Filmen die Möglichkeit, das Video als Bild-in-Bild zu überlagern. Der Videoplayer ist dann frei skalierbar und positionierbar. Habe ich auch schon häufiger mal genutzt, wenn ich nebenher ein bisschen in Facebook chatte und den Film trotzdem nebenher weiter verfolgen möchte. Einfach praktisch!- Innovativ: Etwas, das mir beim iPhone total gefehlt hat. Da hat sich zu wenig getan in den letzten Jahren. Beim Note 2 bekomme ich NFC (wobei ich das aktuell nicht unbedingt benötige, dafür gibt's bisher zu wenig Einsatzmöglichkeiten...), LED-Benachrichtigungen (finde ich ein besonders nützliches Feature!), mehr Freiheiten, einen Kalender, der auch als solcher verwendet werden kann, und die oben genannten Zusätze (S-Pen, Bild-in-Bild,...). Endlich mal was Neues!- Design:OK, hier liegt Apple vorne. Wirklich toll sieht es nicht unbedingt aus. Plastik ist ohnehin selten überzeugend.Trotzdem ist die Verarbeitung absolut OK. Bisher wenig Gebrauchsspuren und alles noch stabil.Optisch aber trotzdem einfach kein Hingucker - das macht Apple deutlich besser.Auch die Größe bereitet erstmal mehr Angst als Freude. Die ist aber schnell verflogen. Es ist nämlich auch mit kleineren Händen gut bedienbar. Außerdem kann man die Tastatur ""zoomen"", so dass sie sich mit einer Hand bedienen lässt, was unterwegs mal praktisch sein kann. Der Transport gestaltet sich dank der flachen Bauweise auch einfacher, als angenommen. In der Hosentasche stört es lediglich, wenn man sitzt. Da hab ich aber das iPhone jedoch auch immer rausgenommen. Macht also keinen Unterschied.Es ist etwas schwerer. Das ist aber schon der einzige Wermutstropfen.- Offenheit: Man kann machen, was man will mit dem Gerät. Nirgends muss ich mich an ein spezielles Programm (Stichwort iTunes) binden. Besonders toll ist auch die Möglichkeit, eine Speicherkarte einzusetzen - die gibt es aktuell sogar kostenlos dazu? (64 GB!)Das hat mich schon immer ein wenig aufgeregt. Auch der Akku kann mal kaputt gehen - kein Problem, Deckel auf, neuer rein. Das schafft Flexibilität, die ich nicht missen möchte.Fazit:Wunderbares Smartphone! Statt Stylefaktor, wird man eher mal wegen der Größe angesprochen, aber bisher hat nach einer kurzen Demo keiner mehr negative Argumente gegen dieses Gerät bringen können. Das spricht doch für sich...Nebenbei bemerkt: Bisher habe ich jedes Jahr mindestens ein neues Handy gekauft (in der Regel eben iPhone...), weil mich immer etwas genervt hat - besonders der Akku. Aktuell habe ich dieses Bedürfnis gänzlich abgelegt. Ich sehe keinerlei Grund, zu wechseln. Dieses Smartphone erfüllt eigentlich alle Bedürfnisse. Da muss schon viel passieren (besonders gutes Design, deutlich längere Akkulaufzeiten, atemberaubende Innovationen), um mich von diesem Gerät in den nächsten Monaten weg zu bringen.Klare Kaufempfehlung!",2013年4月1日 在德国审核

Traumhaftes Gerät,"Plus:- CPU ist schnell, schneller, am schnellsten- Großes Display ... und dadurch ausgezeichnetes Handling (Tippen / Arbeiten / Spielen)- Optisch ansprechend (in grau!)- gar nicht schwer, aber schwer genug um Qualität zu vermitteln- gute Akkulaufzeit (sofern man ca. 2 Tage bei gelegentlicher Nutzung als ausreichend empfinden möge / bei Dauernutzung 1 Tag / bei schwacher Nutzung mehrere Tage)- Die Software: Viele prima Funktionen, auch weil aufs Note2 abgestimmt (einige Rezessionen besagen ""Samsung hat bei der Entwicklung mitgedacht"", diese Aussage kann ich unterschreiben)Minus:- Manchmal könnten Funktionen (Beispiel Handschrifterkennung) einen ticken ausgereifter sein.- Per S-Pen nicht alles steuerbar (etwa zurück zur Menüoberfläche).- Der optisch ansprechende ""graue"" Rücken, hat als Tücke nicht ganz griffig zu sein ... Flutsch &amp; Fallgefahr sind gegeben ... also immer bei der Sache sein, wenn man sein Note2 bedient.- Micro-USB recht wackelig, löst sich leicht aus dem Anschluss ... und warum ist das Kabel weiß? Ich hab ein ""Titanium Grey"" Note 2 bestellt!- Speicher ... 16 GB sind zu wenig. Bitte nicht mosern! Ich möchte _mehr_ Speicher ""Ab Werk"" auf allen Smartphones. Wir wollen Bilder knipsen, Videos sehen, Musik hören und Daten transportierenSonstige Anmerkungen:1) Größe...Es gibt Nutzer (einige dürfen sogar für anerkannte Fachmagazine redaktionelle Tests schreiben), die über die Größe mosern.Es gibt Handyläden zu besuchen, um dieses Gerät vor einem Kauf zu begutachten. Anhand der Datenblätter (die einem praktisch hinterhergeworfen werden), kann man sich auch ausmalen, welcher Riese einen erwartet. Man könnte einen Dummy aus Pappe schneiden (hab ich getan) und so die Größe in aller Ruhe studieren.Die Größe des Note2 als Kritikpunkt anzuführen, gar Wertungspunkte abzuziehen, weil ""nicht mehr mit einer Hand zu bedienen“, ist nicht eine Schuld seitens von Samsung, sondern unserer zu kleinen Hände!Da ich weiß dass ich weder den kleineren BruderGalaxy S3 gekauft habe,noch ein (sehr handliches) IPhone - weiß ich das dieses Gerät wegen seiner Größe entwickelt wurde und nicht um uns mit Unhandlichkeit zu ärgern.2). KameraAls Medienmensch (Grafiker + Filmkameras) sehe ich Kamera und Display bei jedem Gerät kritischen Auges. Für Leute die nicht mit Farbe, Helligkeit und Kontrast arbeiten müssen, wird meine Meinung wahrscheinlich drastisch aufgenommen.Für jene Leute sind die Ergebnisse von Display und Kamera des Note2 ganz sicher großartig. Persönlich kann ich den Hype um die integrierten Kameras (egal von welchen Smartphone) aber nicht ganz nachvollziehen. Bevor ich meine Note2 Fotos öffentlich bringe, werden die i.d.R. Nachbearbeitet. Auf einem Note2 Display sehen die Note2 Fotos grandios aus, auf dem Monitor in Full-HD ganz und gar nicht! Also bleiben wir diesbezüglich realistisch - Es hat dann doch viele Ursachen warum eine Kamera noch auf lange Zeit nicht zu ersetzen sein wird - es wird insofern in den folgenden Jahren nocvh viele neue ""bahnbrechende"" Kameras auf Smartphones geben und sie alle werden ""ganz toll"" sein. Seis drum... wem einfach schnell geknipste Bilder für Facebook reichen, wird vollauf glücklich.Im Vergleich zur Konkurrenz bietet die Kamera des Note2 - bei guten Lichtverhältnissen - gute Ergebnisse ... bei gedimmten Licht, oder im dunkleren, werden sofort rauschige Bilder verursacht, die sind dann auch für alle Nutzer optisch nicht mehr akzeptabel.3) DisplayAuf großen Displays wirken Fotos und Videos qualitativ sehr gut. Hab schon viele ""Wow"" Aussagen erhalten.Kenner werden aber im Vergleich mit einem IPhone einen deutlich schwächeren Weißwert wahrnehmen (hat auch Auswirkung auf die Farbbrillanz;weniger strahlende Farbtöne). Deutlich wird es, wennIPhone und Note2 nebeneinander liegen. Aauch ein HTC jenseits der 400 Euro bringt schönere Farben zustande. Samsung hat also in Sachen Helligkeit (und damit bei der Sichtqualität) für ein mögliches ""Galaxy Note 3"" Luft nach oben! Hat man derlei Vergleiche nicht zur Hand, wird es nicht auffallen. Ich nutze mein Note2 i.d.R. auf höchster Helligkeitseinstellung, dann überzeugen natürliche Farbwiedergabe und Kontrast auch einen Medienmenschen wie mich.3) ZubehörAufmachung und Verpackung super. Ersteindruck beim Auspacken sehr gut.MicroUSB / LadegerätEs wackelt derbe im Note2 Anschluss,... löst sich sogar relativ leicht, bei kleineren Bewegungen. Nicht gut gelöst!Viele male schon ungewollte Datentrennung vom PC… gar nicht gut! Titanium Grey war bestellt, dennoch ist dieses Kabel ganz in weiß gehalten, was ich persönlich einfach nicht schön finde.Der erste Minuspunkt für das Note2 samt Ausstattung, geht zu Lasten eins nicht zufriedenstellendes MicroUSB-Anschluss + KabelFazit:Gute bis sehr gute Ergebnisse bei Technik, Software und Bedienung.Ein insgesamt Sehr gutes Smartphone. S-Pen bei einigen Funktionen tatsächlich sinnvoll. Der Preis ist hoch, aber gerechtfertigt. Kritikpunkte sind vorhanden, vergehen aber in der Fülle an Stärken des Note2 zur Randnotiz.Einzig ein wackelnder MicroUSB ärgert bei Nutzung.9/10 Punkte",2013年1月2日 在德国审核

Sehr gute Wahl!,"Nachdem mein 5830i mein erstes Android Phone war, und das doch recht schnell zeigte, das dort der Speicher trotz 32 gb Karte recht eng war, und die Akkulaufzeit nun mal gar nicht dem entsprach was ich benötigte, hab ich mich entschieden das Smartphone mit dem größten Akku zu kaufen. Und es war eine gute Wahl. Das Note 2 sollte das 5830i sowie mein Lenova A1 Pad ersetzen. Was es in bester Manier tut. Dank der Samsung Aktion wird bald noch mit einer 64 GB Karte aufgerüstet.Die größe... is Hammer! Grad so an der grenze das es zu groß für ein Handy ist, aber für n Pad siehts etwas klein aus. Dank hervoragendem Display und immenser Akkulaufzeit ist es aber wirklich als beides zu nutzen.Die Akkulaufzeit nach test am ersten völlig verspielten Tag, nach 15 Stunden spielen, einrichten, downloaden und allem ausprobieren, hatte ich noch 27% Akku. Damit dürfte eine normale Nutzung von wenigstens 2-3 Tagen drin sein. Das 5830i mußte ich am ersten Tag schon 2 mal laden!Gesprächsqualität mit 2g wie 3g sehr gut, auch Freisprechen ist absolut erstklassig und mit guter Lautstärke.Display, der Hammer, gut ablesbar, sogar im Energiesparmodus. Allerdings es braucht wirklich Strom, nach diesem ersten Tag, wo es auch fast dauernd genutz wurde, hatte das Display laut angabe 47% anteil am stromverbrauch.Nutzung einhändig, geht, aber nicht immer Praktisch, zwar bin ich groß und habe sehr große Händer, aber meist nutz ich es einfach gleich mit beiden Händen.Design und aufbau ist echt nett. Zwar viel Plastik, aber sehr stabil, und von schlichtem iwie edel wirkendendem Design. Die größe alleine macht es allerdings schon sehr auffällig.Das Android 4 läuft flüssig und mit den ganzen gebotenen möglichkeiten muß man erst mal klar kommen. Wenn man das Phone wirklich kennen lernen möchte, muß man einiges an Zeit investieren.Der S-Pen ist mir noch etwas abstrakt, aber man benötigt ihn nicht unbedingt und so werde ich mich nach und nach damit anfreunden.Da ich auch ein freund von spielen bin, hab ich mir gleich mal ein paar anspruchsvolle spiele installiert, was das phone ohne auch nur warm zu werden mit bravour absolviert hat.Den mp3 player muß es natürlich auch ersetzen, aber nach der schon guten erfahrung mit dem 5830i hatte ich hier keine bedenken, und auch wirklich, das koppeln mit dem BT Headset BH-505 ging problemlos und der klang ist fast ein tick besser als auf dem 5830 denke ich. Könnte aber auch an der Euphorie liegen.Wer einen absoluten Allrounder mit großem Akku möchte kommt an diesem Phone nicht vorbei!",2013年3月2日 在德国审核

Für mich (fast) perfekt,"Also gut, ich besitze das Note 2 nun seit ein paar Tagen und ich denke, ich habe mittlerweile genug Erfahrungen gesammelt um das ganze in einer Rezension niederzuschreiben.Ihr seht, ich gebe fünf Sterne, also bin ich natürlich sehr zufrieden mit dem Gerät. Trotzdem spar ich mir jetzt, alles Positive nochmal aufzuzählen, was hier in zig Rezensionen schon sehr ausführlich festgehalten wurde.Nur die Kurzzusammenfassung: Tolles Display, sehr flotte Performance, Stift macht Spaß :-PIch möchte nur ein paar Dinge ansprechen, die mir positiv aufgefallen sind und die ich bisher in den Rezensionen noch nicht bzw. nur sehr knapp gelesen habe, sowie ein paar Minikritikpunkte, die allerdings nicht ausreichen um meine Bewertung unter fünf Sterne zu drücken.Zunächst nochmal kurz zur Größe: Klar sieht man, dass ich ein riesen Teil in der Hose habe, aber das ist für mich ja nichts neues :P Sorry, aber ich hab über fünfzig Rezensionen gelesen und keiner hat den Spruch gebracht, da musste ich einfach ;-). Ab sofort wird die Rezension aber Flachwitz-frei. Versprochen!Also ich finde durch das 16:9 Format und die geringe Tiefe des Smartphones wirkt es bei Weitem nicht so klobig wie beispielsweise das Note 1 oder das LG Vu. Also in meiner (Mann mit Normalgröße)Hosentasche fällt es nicht stark auf und stört auch nicht. Wobei ich bisher noch keine Hülle/Tasche etc habe, was ja auch noch mal ein paar mm ausmacht...Dann zur Display-Helligkeit: Hier scheiden sich ja die Online-Redaktions-Geister: Während zum Beispiel GMSArena eine Helligkeit von 478 cd/m² misst (und somit mehr als das Note 1 und das Galaxy s3, welche GMSArena auch und unter den selben Bedingungen getestet hat)kommt das Note 2 bei Chip-Online gerade mal auf 266 cd/m² (also weniger als das s3 und das Note 1 bei Chip unter den gleichen Test-Bedingungen erzielt haben). Irgendwie komisch, wenn ihr mich fragt. Mein subjektiver Eindruck ist folgender: Bei automatischer Helligkeits-Einstellung ist mir das Display meistens zu dunkel, vor allem bei schwarzem Text auf weißem Hintergrund. Dreh ich allerdings manuell die Helligkeit voll auf, dann passt das ganze wunderbar. Und das Gute daran: Der fette 3100 mAh Akku bietet ausrechend Saft um das ohne große Probleme machen zu können.Noch ein Wort zum Lautsprecher: Heute hat mich im Auto meine CD-Player bzw besser gesagt die eingelegte CD im Stich gelassen, also durfte mich mein neues Smartphone für die Fahrt beschallen - und konnte überzeugen. Für einen Handylautsprecher fand ich den Klang wirklich in Ordnung und die Lautstärke ziemlich fett :PSomit kommen wir auch schon zu dem bisher einzigen echten Manko, auch wenns wirklich nur eine klitzekleine Kleinigkeit ist: Ich bin jetz schon des Öfteren beim Versuch den S-Pen herauszuziehen aus Versehen auf die Zurücktaste gekommen. Was ja wirklich keine große Sache ist, aber irgendwas Negatives muss ich ja auch schreiben ;-)kleine Ergänzung: Der Lautstärken-Wippen-Schalter hat ein kleines bisschen mehr Spiel, als ich es mir gewünscht hätte, aber auch damit kann man leben :-)",2012年10月18日 在德国审核
Das Perfekte Smartphone,"Nach einer langen Reise endlich am Ziel! Von div. iPhones über Sony und nun beim Riesen! Hatte kurz zuvor das neue Xperia Z in Nutzung, was auch ein klasse teil ist, aber leider jedoch ohne den Werksfolien von Sony nicht zu gebrauchen -&gt; da der Touchscreen unbehandelt und kaum bedienbar war sobald ein paar Fingerabdrücke drauf gelandet sind, deswegen hab ich mich auch gleich wieder von dem Sony getrennt und bin nun beim Galaxy Note 2 angekommen, ich hasse Folien auf dem Display es gibt nicht umsonst Gorilla Glas etc.Wollte es eigentlich nur Testweise mal bestellen/ausprobieren, wie es ist und wie der Display ist im Vergleich zum FULL HD des Sony's, aber da hat es mir gleich so gut gefallen das ich es behalten habe.Jetzt erst einmal ein kurzer Vergleich zum Sony:Der erste Eindruck war super, sieht sehr gut aus das Teil keinesfalls billig -&gt; schönes Teil.So als zweites habe ich gleich mal die Display's verglichen, da ich hier keine großen Unterschiede bzw. Rückschritte mehr machen wollte -&gt; Sony - FULL HD : Galaxy Note 2 SUPER HD AMOLEDzuerst sind mir gleich einmal die tollen Farben des AMOLED ins Auge gestochen.... LCD wirkt zwar etwas heller (weißer) AMOLED hat aber die bei weiten eindrucksvolleren Farben und Kontraste &amp; auch Schwarzwerte. Ich habe mir zum Vergleich der Displays's einmal das HD DEMO Video des Sony's auf beide Geräte gezogen und als 2ten Test eine wunderbare Folge von DEXTER;) bei Sony 1080p und für das Notes 2 in 720p konvertiert, da das Notes meines Wissens kein Full HD Format bei Filmen abspielen kann. Als ich die Video's synchron laufen lies war ich echt erstaunt, der Full HD Screen des Sony's ist beeindruckend keine Frage, aber als ich das Video auf dem Notes 2 sah wahnsinn hätte ich nicht gedacht! In der Schärfe gab es keinen nennenswerten Unterschied jedoch sind die Farben des Notes viel besser, wodurch es schon mal deutlich besser aussah. Bei dem 2ten Video Test mit DEXTER ist dann meine Entscheidung für das Notes 2 gefallen, in der Schärfe gab es wieder eig. keinen Unterschied, jedoch hat das Notes wie schon gesagt die besseren Farben, Kontraste &amp; Schwarzwerte und dadurch wirkt das Bild einfach besser vor allem bei Nahaufnahmen bei Personen war ich von dem Notes wirklich beeindruck hier hat man deutlich feinere und mehr Details bei den Haaren einer Person gesehen, da war für mich klar das ich das Note behalten werde.Also das Note 2 muss sich vor den neuen FULL HD Geräten bei weitem nicht verstecken, hier muss ich sogar sagen sieht schöner aus als der FULL HD des Sony's -&gt; schande Sony!Was einiger Testseiten sagen das LCD besser im Sonnenlicht ablesbar sei, kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, mit dem Sony hatte ich Problemden Bildschirminhalt bei Sonne noch gut sehen zu können, da finde ich den AMOLED auch wesentlich besser, dieser ist bei Sonnenschein außen sehr gut ablesbar.Jetzt mal rein zum Note II,das Gerät ist abgesehen von der Größe auch technisch besonders beeindruckend. Es arbeitet wahnsinnig schnell, das ""switchen"" zwischen den Homescreen's geht so schnell wie bei keinem anderen Gerät was ich hatte, trotz Display-Größe und vielen vielen Widgets. Und auch in der Prozessor Leistung muss es sich nicht vor den Neuen verstecken weil es einfach ein Powerhouse ist. Benchmarks zeigen diverser Test Seiten zeigen das es unter den neuen Top Geräten und dem Note 2 kaum unterschiede gibt.Besonders gefreut habe ich mich auch auf den ""S Pen"", finde ich einfach klasse und macht bei der Display größe auch richtig Sinn, hier kann man viele geniale dinge mit machen, von Spielereien wie Malen über Texte schreiben (Text Erkennung ist allerfeinste Sahne, erkennt Quasi jede Klaue) bis kreative Spielereien von zerlegen von Bildern. Die ""Cut &amp; Copie"" (nenne ich jetzt einfach mal so) ist das beste, hierbei kann man einfach per druck auf den Knopf des Stiftes jede X beliebige Stelle des Bildschirm's ausschneiden und kopieren. z.B. drückt man den Knopf des Stiftes und fährt die Konturen einer Person nach, wird die Person ausgeschnitten und in die Zwischenablage kopiert wenn man den Knopf wieder loslässt. Das funktioniert bei jedem X beliebigen Screen auch während laufender Youtube Videos etc.Finde ich richtig klasse hiermit kann man super Spielereien/Werke kreieren.Displaygröße 5,5"" im Übrigen schnell zum Standart geworden, also ich empfinde es schon nicht mehr als groß, würde persönlich auch nie wieder auf ein kleineren Display wechseln wollen, da es einfach klasse ist auf den Display Websites durchzulesen oder Bilder/Filme etc anzuschauen.So jetzt mal zum Akku, dass ist auch ein Grund weshalb ich mich für das Note 2 entschieden habe. Kurz um - POWERHOUSE, der Akku hält extrem lange durch. Wenn er mal die 50% Marke erreicht hat ist es wie 100% von jedem bisherigen Smartphone was ich hatte. Also das Note's hält richtig lange durch, nach 3 Std. Internet surfen und Youtuben vielleicht ca. 20-25% Verlust bei voller Funktionalität also Helligkeit 100% und diverse etliche Funktionen die das Note's hat wie ""Augensensor"" und Multimenü angeschaltet. Zur Akku Laufzeit würde ich gut und gerne sagen das es bei intensiver Nutzung (Spielkinder) trotzdem 2 Tage hält und bei normaler Nutzung 3-4 Tage hält , wenn man den Energiesparer nutzt und die Helligkeit mindert auch noch länger.Also bei dem Note 2 braucht man keine bedenken mehr wegen des Akku's zu haben wenn man das Haus verlässt oder einmal unterwegs ist!So das Beste kommt zum Schluss, weshalb das Note 2 meine Nr 1 ist und ich auch sagen würde das man es eig. nicht mit anderen Smartphones vergleichen kann auch mit den Neuen Geräten, ist das Multitasking des Gerätes bzw. das sogenannte ""MultiMenü"" man kann mit dem Note 2 quasi Bildschirm geteilt arbeiten. Man nutzt z.B. die obere hälfte des Displays für Google Maps und sucht auf der unteren Display Hälfte im Internet nach Standort Recherchen, dabei kann man die ""Fenster"" je nach belieben in der Größe variieren, also beliebig mit Maps mehr des Display's beanspruchen und den Browser keiner machen und umgekehrt.Oder wenn man einen Film anschaut einfach das Wiedergabefenster kleiner machen und während des laufenden Filmes mit dem Rest des Bildschirms eine Sms schreiben oder einfach andere Dinge machen. Und das alles läuft zu 100% super flüssig, keine einzigen Verzögerungen oder gar Ruckler!Das kann kein anderes Smartphone und deswegen ist es für mich das Beste Stück Technik was es derzeit gibt.Die Größe ist außerdem auch überhaupt kein Problem für mich, es passt bei mir bis jetzt in jede Hosentasche (Jeans, Shorts...) und ohne Einschränkungen. Man kann sich problemlos hinsetzten, knien ...usw. könnte mir nur Vorstellen dass das bei den engen Jeans der Frauen doch zu dem ein oder anderen Problem werden kann.Es lässt sich auch noch zu 75% mit einer Hand bedienen.Also ich bin begeistert von dem Note II und bin nach langer Suche und dem letzten Flop endlich bei dem Perfekten Smartphone für mich angekommen! Kann ich nur empfehlen!",2013年4月22日 在德国审核

Al encenderlo te pide el idioma y a partir de ahí, en 2 simples pasos de 30 s tienes el movil listo para usar.Impresionantemente rapido, precioso, pesa poco para lo grande que es y lo mas importante: A los 30 s ni parece tan grande ni mucho menos aparatoso y a todo el mundo que renegaba de el, le acabó encantando por su capacidad para jugar, para trastear fotos.. increíble. No le hace falta ni funda y CABE EN LOS BOLSILLOS PERFECTAMENTE. Eso si, hace algo de bulto, normal.En 2 semanas con el, encantadisimo. Brutal.",2013年1月22日 在西班牙审核

Einfach genial,"Hab das Gerät jetzt gut eine Woche und kann nur sagen dass ich absolut begeistert bin von diesem Ding.Vorab muss ich noch erwähnen dass ich davor ein iPhone 4S besessen haben - war auch im Großen und Ganzen damit zufrieden nur war mir eben das Display viel zu klein.Aber man muss schon sagen - hier sind die aktuellsten Android-Phones (vor allem das Note 2) schon einen Schritt weiter...Die ganzen technischen Daten müssen ja, bei all diesen ausführlichen Rezensionen, nicht mehr durchgekaut werden.Das Gerät ist unglaublich schnell, tolle Akkulaufzeit (min. 2 Tage bei mir, bei normaler Auslastung), Kamera ist Top, Display ist Hammer (auch die Größe ;) ).Ja und der SPen ist einfach ein sehr innovatives Feauture und funktioniert, widererwarten, sehr sehr gut. Und die kleinen Funktionen wie SmartStay, Intelligenter Alarm, Direktanruf, etc. sind auch richtig klasse.Also wen die Größe nicht stört, der kann beruhigt dieses Smartphone (oder auch Phablet/Smartlet) kaufen - es ist einfach das Beste was man zurzeit am Markt bekommen kann.",2012年10月25日 在德国审核

EInfach nur top,"Bin total begeistert. Alle meine Erwartungen wurden erfülltt. Bei diesem Handy geht man keine Kompromisse ein. Display top, S-Pen top. Hab diesen Text damit geschrieben. Danke AmazonErgänzung 1:Hab das Gerät jetzt seit gestern morgen in Betrieb. Nun ist es ca. 11 Uhr am nächsten Morgen und der Akku ist immer noch über 30 %. Ich habe schon 1 Stunde lang telefoniert, die Navigation mit GPS verwendet, WLAN und Bluetooth war immer eingeschaltet, hab ein paar Stunden im Internet gesurft, Nachrichten über Whatsapp geschrieben und den PaperArtist ausgiebig benutzt. Der Akku mit seinen 3100 mAh ist echt ne Bombe. Die Größe des Akkus und die Tatsachse, dass dieser selbstständig ausgewechselt werden kann, war eines der wichtigsten Kriterien für den Kauf des Samsung Note 2. Vorher war ich auf ein HTC One X aus, aber mich hat halt immer diese benutzerunfreundliche Eigenschaft gestört, dass der Akku als Verschleißteil des Handys nicht auswechselbar ist.Grüße",2012年10月20日 在德国审核

Ist das nen Phone? Nen Tablet? Was es ist ein Phablet?!?!,"So nach einer Such und Entscheidungsphase, habe ich den Sprung vom HTC Desire Z auf das Note2 getan... und ich beräue es nicht.Die technischen Daten, lass ich nunmal außen vor, da sie leichter zu googeln sind, als ich das Wort "" Datenblatt "" ausprechen kann. Und beschränke mich auf Entscheidunghilfen für mögliche Käufer.Pro:-Trotz des rießen Displays, sehr leicht.-Endlich machen Pc-Fernzugriffsoftwares (Teamviewer z.b.) Sinn.-Spiele die eine einigermaßen angenehme Grafik haben, haben keine Ladezeiten von 3 Jahren mehr.-Exel, Word und sonstige Anwendungen kann man immer dabeihaben und dank dem S-Pan super bearbeiten.-TouchWiz ist eine schöne aber nicht zuverspielte Benutzerobefläche-Die Schreiberkennung des S-Pens funktioniert super. Bisher einziges Manko sind die ""n"" und ""h"" Schnitzer, da ich es aber erst Seit 2 Tagen benutze kann man dazu keine genaue Aussage machen. Gib deinem Phablet Zeit deine Schrift kennenzulernen!-Lautsprecher / Mikrofon; Das Gerät hat meines erachtens (wie gesagt: vorher hatte ich ein Desire Z!) eine super Klangqualität. Obwohl das Handy einen halben Meter von mir weg auf dem Tisch liegt mit eingeschaltetemLautsprecher, versteht man klar und deutlich sein Gesprächspartner und er einen auch! (War ich vorher nicht gewohnt! Vorallem nicht wenn ich mit meinen Eltern von Handy zu Handy telefoniert hab ;-) )-Trotz der rießen Bildschirmdiagonalen, passt es super in die Hosentasche, da es recht flach ist. (Die Samsung Flip-Hülle tut da auch einen Beitrag)-Schließ es über HDMI an deinen TV an...schwups haste nen Smarttv.(Diese Möglichkeit erweiter sich noch über die Dockingstation, wo man Maus und Tastatur anschließen kann.)Negatives:- Wer kleine Hände hat sollte von dem Kauf absehen,da er dieses Monster mit 2 Händen bedienen müsste. Selbst ich mit recht großen Händen, benutze meist beide zur Nutzung des Phablets.- Das Headset ist mit diesen neumodischen Gummimanschetten versehen, die meines erachtens wenig Tragekomfort mitsichbringen. Aber ich glaube das ist Geschmacks oder Gewöhnungssache.- Wie bei allen Android 4.1 Handy lässt sich der externe Speiche (SD-Karte) nicht mehr für Apps nutzen (es sei den, man besorgt sich Rootrechte, was wiederum die Garantie hinfällig macht)Aber 10GB interner Speicher reichen für Apps allemal und wer mit 64 (in meinem fall sinds nur 32gb) externen SD Kartenspeicher nicht zurecht kommt, soll sich nen Notebook kaufen.- Ich konnte noch kein Feldtest ausführen, aber der Akku zieht sich natürlich bei 5,5Zoll schnell runter! Heißt unterwegs nicht soviel damit rumspielen, oder Akkupack in die Tasche stecken.Und jeden Abend an dieSteckbuckse, aber das ist ja bei anderen Geräten genauso.- Joa...viel mehr negatives fällt mir nun spontan nicht ein. Wenn ich was find...werd ich hiers reinschreiben.Fazit:Wer große Hände hat und sein Smartphone oft unterwegs (Fernmontage, Reisen etc.) ist, ist mit diesem rießen Trümmer aus dem Hause Samsung gut beraten, da er als guter PC-Ersatz durchgeht. Filme,Office-Anwendungen,Emails oder Ebooks, das rießen HD Display macht laune!Der S-Pen macht die Bedienung bequemer und bringt ein paar Funktionen mit sich. We also die Mischung aus Tablet und Smartphone sucht, sollte hier zugreifen!Von meiner Seite 5 Sterne und eine klare Kaufempfehlung, da die Negativpunkte weder schwer ins Gewicht fallen oder aber bei allen andere Geräten gleich sind.",2013年2月10日 在德国审核
Starker Akku und innovatives Gerät,"Ich habe das Samsung Galaxy Note II vor ungefähr einem Jahr gekauft.Ich benutzte das Handy sehr intensiv und möchte daher eine Rezension verfassen.Bedienung: Die Bedienung ist sehr intuitiv und erklärt sich von selbst. Da hat Samsung einen sehr guten Job gemacht. Egal ob man was einstellen möchte oder ändern möchte, braucht man keine Gebrauchsanweisung.Die Bedienung mit dem S-Pen finde ich ebenfalls sehr gelungen. Die Air-View Funktion ist natürlich ein super Feature, da man Nachrichten und Emails nicht unbedingt öffnen muss, um sie ganz zu lesen. Dank Air-View muss man nur den Stift über die Nachricht halten und man kann die ganze Nachricht lesen.Display: Das Display hat eine sehr hohe Auflösung und von der Helligkeit her, ist es auch optimal. Viele empfinden das Handy als zu groß, vor allem die, die noch nie in den Genuss gekommen sind, ein solches Gerät zu benutzen. Jedoch ist die Größe für mich ein Pluspunkt, vor allem, was das Display betrifft. Ich möchte nie wieder auf ein kleineres Display zugreifen müssen.Das Surfen auf Internetseiten macht es um vieles angenehmer. Ich war davor Besitzer eines iPhone 4 und das Surfen war eine Qual, das ständige rein und rauszoomen und scrollen ging mir auf den Sack. Zudem passt das Note II ohne Probleme in jede Männerhosentasche!Prozessor: Der Prozessor ist sehr schnell. Das Note II arbeitet mit einem Quadcore-Prozessor, das auch 1,6 GHz getaktet ist. Bedeutet in anderen Worten, dass das Handy nicht hängt und nicht ruckelt.Akku: Der Akku ist mit 3100mA sehr stark. Man kann das Gerät ohne Probleme einen ganzen Tag benutzen, ohne es gleich aufladen zu müssen. Am Ende vom Tag bleiben meist 40% übrig und man kann mit diesen 40% noch gelassen in die Disko gehen, ohne ""unerreichbar"" zu sein. Wie ich bereits erwähnt habe, habe ich das Gerät ein Jahr lang benutzt und der Akku ist immer noch sehr leistungsstark.Design: Das Design finde ich ebenfalls gelungen, jedoch finde ich das Note III durch die eckige Form um einiges eleganter und hochwertiger (Geschmacksache). In titanium-grey sieht das Smartphone sehr hochwertig und edel aus. Trotz seiner Größe ist das Note II recht leicht, da empfand ich das iPhone 4 um einiges schwerer.Fazit: Das Gerät ist jeden Cent wert gewesen und sehr empfehlenswert! Der Akku ist stark und das Design ist überzeugend. Die Funktionen sind klug durchdacht und intuitiv zu bedienen. Das Note III wird auf jeden Fall mein nächstes Smartphone und ich kann es kaum erwarten, bis mein Vertrag ausläuft.",2013年11月17日 在德国审核
Handy-Tablett? - beides!,"Vorab muess ich gestehen, dass ich bis vor kurzem Mobiltelefontechnisch in der Steinzeit gelebt habe. Meine Erfahrungen als absoluter Beginner in Sache Smartphone koennte daher auch fuer andere Einsteiger nuetzlich sein.Meine Beweggruende das Samsung Galaxy Note 2 zu kaufen:- Es sollte die Funktion von Tablett, Mobiltelefon und Kompaktkamera erfuellen- Grosses Display- Der Smartpen. Alle Funktionen lassen sich daher auch mit Handschuhen bedienen.- Hab mein Handy immer in der Handtasche und mag es beim telefonieren ein Headset zu benutzen. Groesse und Gewicht spielen daher fuer mich keine grosse Rolle.- Gute Kamara- Wollte kein iphone.Mein Eindruck:-Sehr schoenes Display. Farbecht.-Touchscreen verhaelt sich absolut fluessig. Smartpen funktioniert ueberraschend gut. Ich dachte mir, dass der Stift nur dazu geeignit ist die Tastatur zu benutzen und war daher sehr positiv ueberascht von der Handschrifterkennung. Super in Kombination mit der Notefunktion z.B.: zum Einkaufslisten schreiben.-Kamera funktionert einwandfrei auch bei schwierigen Lichtverhæltnissen wie Gegenlicht oder schwaches Licht. Benuetze die Kamera auch als ""Scanner"" um Dokumente direkt als e-mail verseden zu koennen.- Positiv ueberrascht bin ich ueber die Akkuleistung. Kein anderes Smartphone haelt meines Wissens nach bei normaler Nutzung 2-3 Tage.- Mit meinen kleinen Haenden kann ich das Note natuerlich nur mit 2 Haenden benutzen. Selbiges ist mir allerdings auch schon bei anderen ""kleineren"" smartphones wie dem Galaxy S3 usv aufgefallen.- Mein einziger Kritikpunkt ist die Umsetzung von Android durch Samsung. Viel zu viele Apps und Funktionen sind vorinstalliert. Statt Samsungs Kalender benuetze ich lieber google calender usw. Habe bis jetzt noch nicht herausgefunden wie ich die vorinstallierten Funktionen entfernern kann. Die vielen Apps machen das Display unuebersichtlich und ich finde es schwierig meine Favoriten wiederzufinden.Alles in Allem bin ich sehr zufrieden mit meinem neuen Spielzeug.

Vorsicht ;-).....,"... es gibt kein zurück.Spaß beiseite, aber nachdem mir meine Arbeitskollegin das Smartphone in der Mittagspause zum testen gab,wusste ich sofort: Das muss ich haben.Ja, es ist groß, aber man gewöhnt sich sehr schnell dran und möche dann auch kein kleineres mehr.Der Akku hält sehr lange und die Bedienung ist sehr einfach und mit dem S-Pen komfortabel dazu.Man kann es somit auch mal benutzen, ohne bei kalten Wetter die Handschuhe ausziehen zu müssen.Ich habe das Note 2 jetzt seit 4 Wochen und es hatte noch keine Ruckler, oder Abstürze oder sonsteinen dieser Nachteile meiner alten Smartphones.Kamera macht bei ausreichend Licht super Bilder und wenn es mal dunkel ist, macht fast kein Handywirklich gute Bilder... mal abgesehen vom Nokia N8...aber wer will schon in die Steinzeit zurück.Sound und Bildqualität ist auch vom feinsten und was ich besonders toll finde, ist, dass meine Bedenkeneines Amoled Display (Benutzung bei Sonnenlicht) mit der Funktion ""Benutzen im freien"" zerstreut wurden.Diese Einstellung hellt das Display Tageslichtfreundlich -zum Beispiel beim Fotografieren-- auf.Klar, muss man Geld in die Hand nehmen, aber Qualität muss nunmal bezahlt werden.Ich bin froh, dass das Nexus 4 sofort ausverkauft war und das LG Optimus 4x kein update auf Jelly Bean bekommt.Das waren nämlich meine Kandidaten, bevor ich das Note in den Händen hielt.Dann noch Nokia Lumia 920... aber für 679 € ??

Umstieg von Apple's iPhone 5 geglückt!,"Guten Tag zusammen,Ich möchte heute über meine Erfahrungen mit dem vor wenigen Tagen gekauften Samsung Galaxy Note 2 berichten.In den letzten Jahren war ich begeisterter Benutzer von Produkten der Firma Apple. Angefangen mit dem Modell iPhone 3G folgte danach das iPhone 4 und letztendlich im November letzten Jahres das aktuelle iPhone 5.Über die wirklich hervorragende Bearbeitung der Produkte muss man sich eigentlich nicht streiten. Diese sucht weiterhin ihresgleichen. Der ausschlaggebende Punkt, warum ich letzten Endes auf das aktuelle Samsung Galaxy Note 2 umgestiegen bin, hatte bei mir mehrere Gründe. Ein Großteil der mobilen Nutzung erfolgt bei mir in Form von Surfen im Internet sowie im Lesen von Büchern oder News. Nebenbei bemerkt war ich im Besitz eines iPads und musste feststellen, dass ich persönlich leider zu faul bin, um zwei mobile Geräte nebeneinander zu benutzen, so dass das Tablet stets in der Schublade liegen blieb.Die Nutzung auf dem neuen iPhone war leider nicht wirklich viel angenehmer als auf den vorherigen Modellen. Dies war der Punkt an dem ich mich entschieden hatte, es muss ein größeres hybrides Gerät her. Hier hat Samsung momentan noch ein absolutes Alleinstellungsmerkmal, so dass ich mich für dieses Gerät entschied.LieferungAuch wenn dies mit dem Produkt an sich nichts zu tun hat möchte ich kurz einen Satz zur Lieferung los werden. Hierbei möchte ich ein großes Lob an Amazon aussprechen, die wieder einmal bewiesen haben, wie hervorragend der Versandhandel funktionieren kann, wenn man ihn beherrscht. Die Sendung war nach weniger als 24 Stunden bei mir, nachdem ich an einem Vormittag bestellt hatte.VerpackungDas Samsung ist wirklich sehr hochwertig in einer stabilen und sehr schön anzusehenden Box verpackt. Genauso war ich es aus dem Hause Apple gewohnt. Die Box ist gerade einmal so groß wie nötig.LieferumfangDer Lieferumfang entspricht dem der meisten mobilen Geräte. Neben dem Smartphone an sich befindet sich in der Box ein Headset, ein USB Adapter für die Steckdose, einen USB auf Micro USB Kabel, sowie einige Dokumente, wie beispielsweise eine Schnellstartanleitung.VerarbeitungBisher kannte ich Samsungs Smartphones lediglich vom Hörensagen, und hier war die allgemeine Meinung nicht gerade sehr gut. Man sprach immer von billigen Plastik Geräten.Es ist richtig, dass dieses Gerät größtenteils aus Kunststoff hergestellt ist, jedoch bin ich von der Verarbeitungsqualität absolut begeistert, und ich finde das hier die Genauigkeit der Verarbeitung den Produkten aus dem Hause Apple in nichts nach steht. Der Vorteil dieser Materialwahl liegt absolut auf beziehungsweise in der Hand. Das Gerät wiegt gerade einmal gut 180 g und lässt sich damit wirklich absolut hervorragend benutzen. Negativ anzumerken wäre für mich lediglich, dass die Rückseite wahnsinnig glatt ist und das Handy somit leicht aus der Hand fallen könnte. Hier hätte man die Rückschale gegebenenfalls etwas rauer halten sollen. Ich werde mich hier noch nach einem Replacement eines Drittherstellers umsehen.InbetriebnahmeNach dem der Akku und eine Micro SIM-Karte eingesetzt wurden, sowie der Deckel aufgesetzt wurde, kann das Gerät in Betrieb genommen werden. Der Startvorgang ist hierbei in weit weniger als 30 Sekunden relativ schnell erledigt.Das erstmalige Einrichten stellt sich als relativ intuitiv da. Zum Synchronisieren sowie Wiederherstellen kann man sich bei Samsung sowie bei Google, wenn man nicht schon Kunde ist, entsprechende Benutzerkonten anlegen. Dies ist natürlich nicht mit irgendwelchen Kosten verbunden.AndroidDieses Gerät wird mit Android Jelly Bean 4.1.1 (Stand: Januar 2013) ausgeliefert. Für mich war es nach Jahren der Nutzung von iOS das erste Mal, dass ich ein Gerät mit dem Android Betriebssystem benutze. Hierbei habe ich mich innerhalb von wenigen Minuten relativ intuitiv und gut zurecht gefunden. Außerdem weiß man als Technik-affiner Mensch die Vorzüge des anpassbaren Betriebssystemes schnell sehr zu schätzen. Auch die grafisch sehr ansprechende Samsung TouchWiz Oberfläche sieht sehr schön aus und wird absolut flüssig mit diesem Gerät animiert.LeistungDas Note mit seinem 1,6 GHz Quad Core Prozessor läuft absolut hervorragend und flüssig. Ich habe bereits einige sehr intensive Spiele getestet und konnte keinerlei Verzögerungen feststellen. ich bin fest davon überzeugt, dass man hier noch langfristig genügend Leistungsreserven hat, um zukünftigen Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.DisplayDas Samsung Galaxy Note 2 löst auf dem sehr angenehmen Super Amoled HD Display mit 1080x720 Pixeln auf. Vom Look &amp; Feel ist diese Auflösung dem Apple Retina Display absolut ebenbürtig in Sachen Schärfe und nicht etwa ein graus wie ein Downgrade vom neuen iPad zum iPad 2 als Beispiel. Ebenfalls ist die Sättigung akzeptabel für ein Smartphone-Display dieser Größe. Einziger Kritikpunkt ist ein deutlicher Blaustich beim betrachten von den Seiten.trotz der hierfür immer noch geringen Größe macht das Lesen von eBooks hier viel Spaß.Google App StoreIm Vergleich zu Apples App Store muss sich dieser wahrlich nicht verstecken. Alle wichtigen und bekannten Apps sind ebenfalls für Android verfügbar und funktionieren. Oftmals sind kostenpflichtige Apps bei Android etwas günstiger als bei Apple oder es gibt Kostenlose Varianten.FazitMan bekommt hier für gut 500 Euro ein wunderbar verarbeitetes Gerät, dass den Spagat, ein Smartphone sowie ein Tablet zu ersetzen, meiner Meinung nach hervorragend meistert! Für gerade einmal knapp 50 Euro konnte ich den internen 16 GB großen Speicher per Micro SDXC Karte auf insgesamt stolze 80 GB erweitern.Hinweis:Diese Rezension wurde von mir ausschließlich mit der Spracherkennung der Swype Beta Tastatur erfasst.Gegebenenfalls wird diese Rezension von mir Step-by-Step durch die wachsende Erfahrung erweitert.Herzliche Grüße aus EssenRalf Hsn - 2013",2013年2月4日 在德国审核

Aller guten Dinge sind Drei?,"Das Telefon müsste, wenn ich von den negativen Eindrücken mal absehe, 5 Sterne bekommen. Die ganzen Feature zähle ich nicht auf, diese wurden schon zahlreich beschrieben. Beeindruckend ist für mich die Stiftfunktion, die (Rechen)Geschwindigkeit sowie die Größe. Die Auflösung ist bestens, ein Retina-Display vermisse ich nicht. Skepsis bei der Größe hatte anfangs, diese verfliegen aber wenn man merkt dass dieses auch Vorteile bringt und man mit dem Smartphone mehr Spaß hat. Hosentaschengeeignet ist es nur bedingt. Sobald man sich irgendwo hinsetzen will, sollt man es aus der Hosentasche nehmen.Warum aber keine 5 Sterne? Dies wegen Hardwarefehler und Bauartbedingungen. Ich musste zwei Telefone wieder zurück schicken.Das Erste hatte Stiftprobleme, der Stift schrieb schon bevor er das Display berührte. Dies schein ein häufiges Problem zu sein und kann man in Foren zahlreich nachlesen.Zudem machte die Kamera in der Mitte einen roten Fleck bei Schwachlicht.Das zweite Galaxy Note 2 als Austauschgerät war wieder Fehlerbehaftet. Schaute man auf das Display mit weißem Hintergrund so war unten und oben das Bild bläulich und un der Mitte das rötlich. Kippte man leicht (nur ein paar Grad) den Blickwinkel, so nahm rasant das blaue Display überhand. Damit zu surfen ist exprem unbefriedigend. Der Übergang von rot zu blau war sehr extrem und alles andere als langsam übergehend.Das dritte Handy ist nun ok. Der Stift funktioniert. Die Blaufärbung beim Kippen ist noch da aber geringer und bei Schwachlicht ist der rote Spot bei der Kamera noch zu verschmerzen. Das Handy kann keine Kamera ersetzen. Wenn ich es bei hellem Tag benutze sind die Fotos OK.So wie Super AMOLED beworben wird, so toll ist es gar nicht. Klar, alles sieht wie gemalt aus, von der Seite kann man alles noch erkennen. Aber die Farbverschiebung zur Blickwinkelabhängigkeit mit starker Blaufärbung schon bei 45° sind nicht toll. Deutlich sieht man es bei einem weißen Bild. Bei farbigen Bildern fällt es einem nicht so sehr auf.Da aber mir die Features sehr gefallen, gebe ich 4 Sterne. Zudem gibt es auch keine Alternative zu diesem Handy.",2012年12月31日 在德国审核

Ich liebe den großen Bildschirm und lese inzwischen lieber darauf als auf dem iPad, einfach deshalb, weil es viel leichter ist.Ich nutze auch gerne die App-Vielfalt des Android-Stores.Aber: einen großen Nachteil hat das Gerät für mich doch. Ich nutze das Office-Programm ""One note"" sehr ausgiebig und habe mir hier einen großen fachlichen Wissens-Schatz angelegt, den ich auf dem iPad sehr intensiv nutzen kann.Aber die Android-App von One note sieht zwar genau gleich aus - kann aber keine PDF`s anzeigen. Das ist wirklich dumm - der Großteil meiner Eingaben ist somit nicht nutzbar!Damit muss ich doch wieder das schwerere iPad mitschleppen.Das 2. Manko wurde bereits benannt - die fehlende Möglichkeit selbst Speicherplatz vom internen Speicher auf eine externe Karte auszulagern.

Bestens Smartphone (Phablet) im heurigen Jahr.,"Hallo Liebe Amazon Gemeinde..Hab Das Galaxy Note 2 seit Gestern in meinen Händen. Hatte das glück ein Gerät gleich der ersten Charge zu bekommen.Danke Amazon .. Lieferung schnell und alles wie immer i.o.....So zum wichtigsten.Ich glaube für Vieltelefonierer könnte dieses Gerät genauso wie das Note 1 eventuell nicht das richtige Gerät Sein.. Außer Mann Telefoniert Hauptsächlich im Auto (Freisprechanlage etc)..Aber im Bereich Multimedia is dieses Händy wirklich unschlagbar.Splitscreen Multitasking – zwei Dinge gleichzeitig tun. Splitscreen Multitasking. Will heißen, dass man zwei Anwendungen gleichzeitig geöffnet hat und beide auf dem Display des Phablets angezeigt werden, man also parallel arbeiten kann.Das Gerät spielt wie alle Android Geräte . Divx Xvid MKV etc problemlos ab. ohne umwandlung.Auf 5,5 Zoll der Hammer.Der Sound des Lautsprechers ist leider nur Mono.. also nur ein Lautsprecher , klingt aber sehr gut und laut. sehr Schöner klang.Das Display hat eine Auflösung von 1.280 x 720 Pixeln inkl FullHD. Also mann sagt immer der Bildschirm ist Toll oder der Bildschirm.. Spielt alles keine Rolle für mich ist das Display TOP.Der schnelle 1,6 GHZ getaktete Quadcoreprozessor ist natürlich ordentlich schnell. Ruckler gehören eigentlich seit den Dual Core Geräten schon zur Vergangenheit an. Dazu noch 2 GB Hauptspeicher.Akkuleistung war von Gestern auf heute sehr gut.. Habs eigentlich nicht verwendet nur Emails abgerufen und hatte heute morgen 100% und gegen 18.00 Uhr 13 % Verbraucht.Tolle funktionen wie SmartStay (Bildschirm schaltet nicht ab solange mann das Display ansieht) NFC und S-Beam runden das Gerät ab.Und natürlich zu guter letzt Der neue S-PEN. Funktioniert sehr gut und sehr genau. Mann erhält sofort eine Miniaturansicht wenn man den Stift zb in der Galerie über die Fotos Hält oder über Videos. Genauer muss ich es erst selber Testen.Mein Hauptkaufgrund ist einfach mir ist ein Tablet zu groß und ein Iphone zu klein. Und wenn mann Internetsurfen will. Multimedia Nutzt ist das Note das beste Teil zur Zeit.So ein paar Punkte:+ LED Benachrichtigungsanzeige.+ NFC+ Smart Stay+ Riesen Akku+ Bluetooth+ Jelly Bean+ 1,6 GHZ Quad Core+ 2 GB Ram+ Sd Karten Slot+ Unterstützung aller Videoformate+ S-PEN (neue Version)+ Dateiexplorer+ Multiwindow (seit 5.10.2012 gibt es ein Update.. Jetzt ist Multiwindows dabei)+ Preis ist Ok+ Flash und Html 5+ 8 MP Kamera Hinten+ 1,9 MP Vorneein kleines Minus das Gerat hat kein LTE.. Aber ehrlichgesagt in Österreich uninteressant da der LTE ausbau stillsteht. Und die Tarife sind noch immer der Horror..Also wenn das Note 5 Rauskommt wird LTE villeicht interessant und Leisbar sein.Also zumindest in Kärnten siehts noch schlecht aus..Mir fällt ehrlichgesagt noch kein wirklicherMinus Punkt ein.. Villeicht kommt ja noch was..Also unbedingte KaufempfehlungHier das Offizielle Video[...]",2012年10月2日 在德国审核
Ausgezeichnetes Gerät,"Ich besitze das Note II seit es in Österreich erschienen ist, also nun knappe 3 Jahre, und bin nach wie vor vollends zufrieden damit. Es sieht heute noch fast so aus wie am ersten Tag (nur leichte Abnutzungserscheinungen am Plastikgehäuse) und funktionierte immer perfekt.Einzig die Akkulaufzeit hat nach einem guten Jahr (intensiver) Nutzung plötzlich stark nachgelassen, habe ihn daher durch einen neuen ersetzt und komme seitdem wieder gut über den Tag; da ich heute aber nicht mehr soviel surfe/spiele, muss ich es durchschnittlich nur jeden 3. Tag laden.Auch wenn es so aussieht, als müsste ich mir noch länger kein neues Gerät zulegen, wird es für das nächste Handy schwer werden, in diese Fußstapfen zu treten, denn hier stimmt meiner Meinung nach wirklich alles - Verarbeitung, Optik, Geschwindigkeit, Akkulaufzeit.

Wie ich bei meinen Kumpels feststellen konnte, kann man mit dem Note 2 auch iphone Nutzer begeistern, da einer meiner Kumpels das Gerät fast nicht mehr aus der hand geben wollte, so viele Dinge gibt es da zu entdecken.Positives:-Super Amoled HD Display ist fantastisch (diesmal ohne Pentile Matrix)-Titanium Grey sieht super aus-Stifteingabe ist echt genial, mit dem Air View pointer-Geschwindigkeit, vom Surfen bis zum Bedienen alles fix und flüssig-Flash funktioniert!! Habs grad mal getestet, Flash funktioniert auch auf dem Galaxy Note 2 mit Jelly Bean, konnte videos und TV im Internet ohne Probleme streamen, nachdem ich den Flashplayer installiert hatte. (Nicht mehr im Playstore aber Internet erhältlich)-Beim herausziehen des S-Pens kann man sich verschiedenene automatische Töne einstellen-Man kann aktivieren das man gewarnt wird, wenn man weggeht ohne den S-Pen wieder einzustecken-Man kann vibrations feedback einstellen, wenn der Pen über den Display schwebt-mit der Air View Funktion kann man auch in Widgets Scrollen, auf internetseiten scrollen und zwischen Homescreens wechseln ohne das Display zu berühren-verbessertes Face unlock, mit Augenblinzel Erkennung und Kombination mit Sprachentsperrung möglich-Smart Rotation, das Displaybild rotiert nur, wenn das Gesicht nicht waagericht ist, sprich wenn man nicht auf dem Bett liegt-Auf die Rückseite von Bildern kann man virtuell eine notiz schreiben-wenn man in der Kamera bei Einzelbildern 20 Bilder am stück schießt (knopf gedrückt halten), kann man diese 20 Bilder als Serienfolge in einer Art Slow motion Diashow mit Musik anschauen-bei der videokamera kann man slowmotion videos bis 1/8 der Geschwindigkeit und Fastmotion bis zu das 8 Fache der normalen Speed drehen-Best faces, es werden schnell 5 Bilder von Leuten geschossen, wobei dann deren Gesichter aus den 5 Aufnahmen austauschen kann, um evtl. bei geschlossenen Augen oder bei Grimassen ein besseres zu nehmenNegatives:-wlan Empfang, die Reichweite scheint nicht so gut wie beim Galaxy S3 zu sein, schade, aber vielleicht kann man da noch etwas mit einem update dran drehen und optimieren?-multi view scheint noch nicht im deutschen/euopäischen Note 2 implementiert zu sein, zumindest konnte ich es bisher noch nicht starten. Das einzige was bissher geht ist der pop up Video player und der pop up browser. Das Update soll aber in den nächsten Tagen auch nach Deutschland kommen, in Frankreich und England ist es bereits erhältlich.-Google now, dafür kann das Note2 wahrscheinlich nichts, aber Google now, bzw. das voice search funktioniert im deutschen, aber auch im US englisch (habe beide getestet) nicht so gut wie in den Videos gezeigt wird. Mit dem Aufweckbefehl Google reagiert sie häufig nicht, auch spricht sie weniger z.B ""what's the cast of the big bang theory"" sagt sie nichts, obwohl dies in den videos beantwortet wurde. Entweder ist daran Google oder evtl. Samsung schuld?Das Galaxy Note 2 begeistert nicht nur mit seinem rießigen Display und dem verbesserten S-Pen, auch bei den Software Features hat sich Samsung einiges einfallen lassen. Es macht einfach Spaß es zu bedienen.Edit: Habe gerade noch herausgefunden, das man im Videoplayer während man ein Video anschaut, in das Video mit Pinch to Zoom herein und heraus zoomen kann.Edit 2: Mittlerweile ist nun auch in Deutschkland das Update mit Multi View erhältlich, genial!Edit 3: Für alle Käufer von einem Note 2 oder S3 hat Samsung einen 20€ Gutschein im Video Hub Hinterlegt und auch kann man den Music Hub mit allen Funktionen füe 1 Woche kostenlose nutzen, wenn man möchte.",2012年10月8日 在德国审核

Prima Akkulaufzeit, klasse Bedienung, gutes Konzept im Allgemeinen und super Preformance.Einen Stern Abzug gibt es aus folgendem Grund:Ich erwarte von einer Sperrfunktion, dass das Handy auch komplett gesperrt ist. Lediglich der Ein/Aus-Knopf sollte das Display einschalten. Bei Samsung hat dieser jedoch noch mehr Funktionen; z. B. startet das Handy direkt neu, wenn der Knopf 10 Sekunden gedrückt wird. Dies passiert unbemerkt und damit ist das Telefon offline.Ich trage es in einer Gürteltasche und dies war schon zweimal der Fall.",2013年2月22日 在德国审核

Molti aspetti positivi pochi negativi,"Ho scelto questo smartphone per avere telefono e alcune funzionalità del tablet insieme. Si tratta sicuramente di un dispositivo di ottimo livello, lo schermo grande permette di navigare e comunque di leggere qualunque testo agevolmente; personalmente uso molto calendario e note per lavoro (agenda, appunti, ecc.) e la scrittura è veloce e semplice sia con la tastiera (una volta scaricata la tastiera italiana: si scarica molto velocemente appena collegati, andando su impostazioni) che con il riconoscimento di scrittura manuale. Il consumo della batteria non è alto come temevo se non si rimane costantemente connessi; può durare più giorni usando il risparmio energetico. Non ho ancora sperimentato tutte le potenzialità dello smartphone; sono comunque molto soddisfatta anche della velocità di navigazione, dello schermo, della fotocamera, della radio. Inoltre è leggero, nonostante le dimensioni sta comodamente in tasca o in una tasca della borsa e con gli auricolari si può usare senza neppure estrarlo. Un difetto è per me la sveglia: ero abituata a quella di un Nokia che funzionava col telefono spento; con questo, se il dispositivo è spento non si attiva, il che mi sembra davvero incredibile.",2013年5月7日 在意大利审核
Für mich die Referenz.,"Moinsen Spochtskameraden,hier nun meine Rezension zum Note 2. Wie auch schon bei meiner Rezension zum „S3“ werde ich hier viele persönliche Eindrücke schildern und vor allem auch wieder die Vergleiche zum iPhone ziehen, diesmal zum 5er. Ich werde hier keine weiteren Neuigkeiten zum N2 veröffentlichen, da hier zum Gerät an sich schon reichlich gesagt wurde. Wem der Alltagsvergleich zum ip5 nicht passt, und wem vor allem kritische Worte Richtung Apple (von einem Apple-User (iPhone/iPad/MacBook)) nicht gefallen, der sollte an genau dieser Stelle wegklicken und sich bei einem heißen Kakao in den Sessel schmeißen, die Füße hoch legen und den Winter aus dem Fenster heraus genießen….Für alle Interessierten geht es jetzt weiter:Die Vorgeschichte in Kurzform….-ca. 4 Jahre iPhone (3gs, 4, 5)-Mitte 2012 Umstieg auf S3-Ende 2012 Wechsel auf ip5-Januar 2013 Wechsel auf N2Ich war sehr lange sehr zufrieden mit den diversen ip Modellen, das kann man nicht abstreiten. Jedoch habe ich dann irgendwann das S3 bekommen und bin seitdem mehr als begeistert von Android und den Samsung Geräten. So ist es nun auch mit dem N2.Der Hauptgrund, warum ich wieder vom ip5 (beruflich bekommen) auf ein Samsung Gerät gewechselt bin, ist der relativ einfach. Für mich persönlich bietet das N2 einfach viel mehr Dinge, die ICH persönlich im Alltag benötige und die mir viiieeel mehr Spaß am Handy bringen, als es das ip5 gemacht hat. Das ip5 bietet ein geschlossenes System, welches von der Funktionalität mit meinem MacBookPro und iTunes unerreicht bleibt, da machen wir uns nichts vor. Allerdings war es das auch schon fast wieder, was ich an wirklich stichhaltigen Vorteilen anbringen kann.Beispiele (ohne groß auf Details einzugehen, da diese hier weitestgehend in den Rezensionen genannt wurden):KameraWenn man sich die Einstellungsmöglichkeiten des N2/S3 bei der Kamera ansieht, bleibt das ip5 mehr als blass! Serienbildaufnahme, BestShot, Gesichtserkennung usw.!! ip5 Fehlanzeige!Bilder / GalerieVerwenden von Bildern beim N2/S3:Wenn man in einem Bild auf die Menütaste drückt, hat man sehr viele Möglichkeiten, was mit dem Bild geschehen soll.Versenden / Benutzen per-SMS-Hintergrundbild-Kontaktfoto-Whatsapp-Facebook-Dropbox-Email-Twitter-Instagram-usw.ip5 leider nur Facebook, Mail, Nachricht, TwitterMusikplayerich war lange Zeit begeistert von der Sync mit iTunes auf dem ip3/4/5. Das war das Maß der Dinge (wenn man sich denn auf iTunes einlassen konnte/wollte). Das hat mir bei Samsung gefehlt. Nun kann man aber zum Einen per Kies die iTunes Playlisten importieren, zum Anderen nutze ich persönlich jetzt aber die Vollversion vom „Rocket Player“ in Verbindung mit „iSyncr“. Was soll ich sagen?!? TOP. Geht absolut problemlos und einfach. Es werden alle Daten (Playlists) so synchronisiert, wie ich es haben will. Absolut idiotensicher. Kein Träne mehr nach iTunes zurückgeweint… :-)Ich möchte nun wirklich keinen Glaubenskrieg der Smartphones lostreten, gleichwohl aber meine Meinung äußern, die sich seit den letzten 2 Jahren immer weiter von den iPhones wegbewegt hat:Ich habe wieder mal berufsbedingt ein ip5 bekommen können, wieder mal fast geschenkt, daher zugeschlagen. Aber nach den ersten Stunden waren meine Fragen: „Was hat sich hier getan? Wo ist der WOW-Effekt? Wo sind die Neuerungen? Wo ist der Vorteil zum 4s?“Dazu wieder mal ein neuer Ladeanschluss. Wieder alle Dockingstationen, KFZ-Lader usw. für die Tonne!! Einfach nur nervig und ja, ich sehe es langsam als Verarsche am Kunden an! Weitestgehend alle Handyhersteller versuchen sich auf einen Standard zu einigen, was die Ladekabel/Anschlüsse angeht und Apple haut die xte Version an Anschlüssen raus. Das nervt nur noch und lässt mich an der Unternehmenspolitik stark zweifeln.Es war mehr als ernüchternd, ja schon enttäuschend, was das ip5 als Flaggschiff der Apple-Schmiede zu bieten hat. Es hängt im technischen Bereich dem S3/N2 meilenweit hinterher. Ein Prestigeobjekt ist es vllt immer noch, aber das reicht mir nicht und aus dem Alter bin ich raus. Ich will nicht mit einem ip5 angeben, wobei ich mir auch die Frage stelle, wie das gehen soll…?!Die Materialien sind hochwertiger als bei den Samsung Geräten, keine Frage. Aber was kommt dann? Wenn man ehrlich ist, nicht mehr viel….! Bei den Samsung Geräten hört man immer wieder „Plastik-Bomber“ o. ä. JA!! Es ist und bleibt Kunststoff. Aber dieser ist sehr widerstandsfähig und zudem LEICHT!Ich persönlich sehe mittlerweile ein Smartphone als Alltags-/Lebensbegleiter. Damit meine ich nicht „Partnerersatz“ :-), aber bei mir ist ein Smartphone ständig dabei und dann will ich einfach die Dinge haben, die ich benötige. Und das erfüllt das N2 hervorragend. Ich will doch auch Spaß am Handy haben, es soll mich doch auch unterhalten, Spiele, surfen, Email, zeichnen, malen, einfach auch die Zeit vertreiben. Wenn es nur um das reine Telefonieren gehen würde, hätte ich immer noch mein Nokia 8110i!! Für die jüngeren unter Euch:[...]400ma/h Damals der Hammer und hat für 2 Wochen Standby gereicht!! :-)Wir reden beim ip5 über ein Smartphone, welches 679,- € kostet (16 GB) und sehr preisstabil ist und bleibt. Es wird auch im Juli 2013 noch 679,- kosten. Und für das Geld bietet das ip5 mir einfach zu wenig neue Dinge und zu wenig bekannte Dinge, die mich vom Hocker reißen.Apple lässt sich feiern, dass man es endlich geschafft hat, eine Wlan Sync einzubauen?! Stark!! „Schließen Sie bitte Ihr iPhone per Verbindungskabel an Ihren PC an, um per Wlan zu synchronisieren.“ Aha!Na ja, ich könnte noch stundenlang schreiben, aber das macht es ja nicht besser.Ich wiederhole noch mal, dass ich eine rein subjektive Meinung hier vertrete und dass die Dinge, die Ihr hier lesen konntet, sich nur auf meine Meinung beziehen.Abschließend kann ich JEDEM raten, sich mal ein Android Handy zur Probe zu beschaffen, falls möglich, und sich mit dem Gerät mal ein paar Tage auseinanderzusetzen. Genau diese Vorgehensweise hat mir „die Augen geöffnet“. Ich habe mich auch wie viele vom ip-Hype blenden lassen, ohne auf die Features und Eckdaten wirklich zu achten.Austauschbarer Akku, 3.100 ma/h Akku, unendlich Leistung, das sind nur allein schon 3 Dinge, die ausreichen würden, dass ip schachmatt zu setzen. Sorry, vllt etwas übertrieben, aber ich bin mittlerweile davon geheilt, ein mittelmäßiges Produkt mit allen Mitteln zu verteidigen. Ich würde mich auch freuen, wenn mehr Leute sich dem Apple-Hype mal ein wenig kritischer gegenüberstellen und nicht als Antwort auf den austauschbaren Akku beim N2/S3 eine Montageanleitung und ein ebay-Kaufangebot für Apple-Werkzeug zum Akkutauschen posten…mal drüber nachdenken…!Es wird sich jetzt wohl nicht vermeiden lassen, dass es hier hoch her gehen wird und dass sich der ein oder andere ip Fan zu Wort melden wird, aber wenn sollten wir das dann bitte sachlich behandeln.In diesem Sinne.______________________________________________Hier noch ein kleiner Nachtrag v. 07.02.13:Geändert hat sich an meiner absoluten Begeisterung für das N2 gar nichts! ich entdecke immer mehr Dinge, die einfach Spaß machen und den Alltag erleichtern und einfach dazu da sind, das mir durch das N2 die Zeit vertrieben wird.Ich habe – und das meine ich jetzt ohne zu meckern – noch einen wichtigen Pferdefuß beim iPhone5 zu melden, als Warnung, nicht um wieder Grundsatzdiskussionen auszulösen:Der mobile Internetempfang lässt sich nicht mehr manuell umstellen. Das heißt, dass ip5 „entscheidet“ automatisch, ob es im Edge oder 3G Modus unterwegs ist. Je nach Verfügbarkeit am jeweiligen Ort. das zieht ersten Akku ohne Ende und zweitens finde ich es eine Frechheit, dass man dies nicht mehr umstellen kann. Ich will nicht 7 Stunden am Tag mit UMTS Highspeed Mobilinternet durch die Gegend laufen, wenn ich nur Edge benötige, um zu Beispiel Whatsapp Nachrichten zu empfangen. Des Weiteren nagt der UMTS Empfang deutlich an der Signalstärkte für den Mobilfunk-Empfang!LTE ist an- und abwählbar.Beim N2 kann alles eingestellt werden, so wie man es selber entscheiden will.",2013年1月22日 在德国审核

"Zur Zeit wohl das beste Android ""Handy"" am Markt","Meiner Ansicht nach ist das Note 2 zur Zeit das beste Android Handy am Markt.Warum dann keine fünf Sterne? Nun, die Größe ist nicht unbedingt ein Handschmeichler, Nutzer mit kleinen Händen werden da ihre Schwierigkeiten haben, vor allem beim Telefonieren aber den einen Stern Abzug gibt es für das Display und zwar konkreter für die Displayhelligkeit. Das Note 2 kann man im Freien kaum nutzen, da die Helligkeit relativ gering ist.Das Display an sich liefert aber eine sehr gute Qualität, auch im Vergleich zum S3.Einen Vergleich zum iPhone 5 verkneife ich mir jetzt, da der ""gewöhnliche"" iPhone 5 Käufer wohl kaum zum Note 2 greift und umgekehrt. Trotzdem sei erwähnt, dass das iPhone 5 Display im Vergleich gut und gerne DOPPELT so hell ist, wie das Note 2 Display. Schade, hier hat Samsung eindeutig gepatzt.Das war es dann aber schon weitgehend mit der Kritik, die Verarbeitung meines grauen Gerätes ist erstklassig, es wirkt hochwertig und deutlich hochwertiger als mein weisses S3.Einzig und allein der Akkudeckel ist ein wenig fummelig, erst im dritten Anlauf schaffte ich es, ihn richtig einklicken zu lassen. Hier gibt es Raum für Verbesserungen.Achtung: Das 7100 Modell hat KEIN LTE, offenbar wird oft das Gegenteil behauptet. Das Modell mit LTE hat die Modellnummer 7105. Nur zur Info.Ansonsten ist, so glaube ich, fast alles über das Note 2 gesagt worden. Android 4.1.1 läuft sehr flüssig, was vermutlich auch mit der guten Hardware des Note 2 zu tun hat. Die bekannten Android ""Micro""-Ruckler sind nur selten vorhanden, wenn auch immer noch da und im direkten Vergleich zum Note 1 (allerdings mit Android 4.0.4), ist eine DEUTLICHE Performancesteigerung feststellbar. Alles läuft einfach ein Stück flotter ab.Wen die Größe nicht stört, der erhält mit dem Note 2 das perfekte Android Smartphone. Die Performance stimmt, der Stift kann sehr nützlich sein und gerade beim Internetsurfen macht das große Display sehr viel Spaß.Meiner Ansicht nach ein sehr gelungener Nachfolger des Note 2.",2012年10月5日 在德国审核

Es ist da!!!,"Das Samsung Galaxy Note 2 ist Lieferbar :)Freitag bestellt, gestern an der Packstation abgeholt und noch im Auto ausgepackt.Erster Eindruck, es ist riesig und ist das wirklich nur Plastik. Es ist sehr sauber verarbeitet.Schnell das Akku ausgepackt, dann die Batterieabdeckung abgenommen. Der Deckel ist wirklich dünn und macht, wenn man ihn alleine in der Hand hält, keinen sehr wertigen Eindruck. Doch als Gesammtpaket fällt es nicht ins Gewicht. Nichts knarzt oder ist wackelig.Kurz möchte ich noch auf die anderen Rezensionen eingehen.Der ewige Vergleich zwischen Samsung und Apple nervt ein wenig. Jedes Gerät erfüllt seinen Zweck, und keines ist so überlebenswichtig, dass man wenn man Partei für ein Gerät ergreift dem Gegenüber Kraftausdrücke jeglicher Art an den Kopf werfen sollte!Das Galaxy Note 2 ist kein iPhone und ob man die Geräte miteinander vergleichen sollte ist fraglich.Dafür ist der Stift beim Note so unglaublich gut! Internetsurfen und den Stift zur Hand zuhaben ein Traum, punktgenaues Anklicken von Links überhaupt kein Problem mehr. Den Stift über ein Menü führen, Untermenü öffnet sich dann den gewünschten Punkt anklicken. Ich bin einfach begeistert. Wie oft hab ich mich mit meinen ""dicken Fingern"" bei meinem iPhone und bei meinem Samasung Galaxy 2 verklickt.Der Stift hat und kann was :) So macht Surfen, Terminplanung, eBooks und auch die ein oder andere Textgestaltung während meiner täglichen Pendeltour mit Bus&amp;Bahn Spaß.Das Samsung Galaxy Note 2 ersetzt bei mir mein SGS2 und mein Galaxy Tablet 10.1.Zum Pro und Kontra gebe ich nur ein paar Dinge an die mich stören oder die ich hervorheben möchte. (Auf die ganzen Details wird in anderen Rezensionen schon genug eingegangen)Ein paar ""negative"" Dinge:- Das Einzige was mir nach der kurzen Zeit aufgefallen ist und mich ein wenig stört ist, dass die Umlaute auf der Tastatur im Vergleich zum SGS2 nicht mehr direkt anwählbar sind- Das weiße Ladekabel vom Note2 sitzt nicht so fest, wie das ""alte"" vom SGS2. Ich nutze lieber das alte, vielleicht hab ich ein ""Montagskabel"" erwischt ;(Was mir Positiv aufgefallen ist:- In der Hektik ist es passiert, Schlüssel und Note2 in einer Tasche. Das Display hat keinen einzigen auch noch so leichten Kratzer! Ich bin begeistert und erleichtert.",2012年10月2日 在德国审核

"Super Gerät, hoffentlich benötigen Sie keine Reparatur","Bei meinem Gerät Galaxy S3 Neo war die GPS- Funktion defekt.Es war sehr aufwendig und langwierig bis Samsung mit ihrem Tutorenprinzip den Defekt anerkannt und die Reparatur genehmigt hatte.Dann begann das eigentliche Drama. Ich hatte das Gerät mit seinem kompletten Lieferumfang in der Originalverpackung zum Samsungservicepartner ""datrepair"" eingesendet.Die prognostizierte Reparaturzeit inklusive Transfer sollte 6 Tage betragen. In Wirklichkeit wurde es dann ein ganzer Monat. Wahrscheinlich auch nur ein Monat, weil ich nachgehakt hatte.Als ich das Gerät dann zurückbekam traute ich meinen Augen nicht. Das Handy wurde mit fehlender Rückwand und ohne die Teile des Lieferumfangs zurückgeliefert. Ich reklamierte diese Fehlleistung. Die Teile waren bei datrepair nicht mehr auffindbar. Bis heute, nach eineinhalb Monaten, habe ich immer noch kein benutzbares Handy. Einen Ersatz wollen Sie auch nicht liefern oder bezahlen. Samsung läßt mich im Streit mit datrepair auch im Regen stehen. Ich habe bisher viele Samsungprodukte wegen ihrer guten Qualität gekauft. In Zukunft werde ich mich wohl anders orientieren.",2015年11月13日 在德国审核

"es ist wirklich das beste SM, wenn man keine Angst vor Größe hat","Ich telefoniere vielleicht 2-3 mal im Monat (na gut - 5 mal), alles, was ich mit meinem Smartphone normalerweise mache ist sehr viel surfen, etwas spielen, natürlich apps verwenden (amazon, deutsche bahn, ebooks, navigation etc) und alles andere, was das SM bieten kann (Radio, Music, Video).Daher ist für mich die Größe, oder die Tatsache, dass Note II etwas zu groß ist, die letzte Sache. iPad ist zu groß für mich, wenn ich auf meinen Bus warten möchte oder ganz kurz was nachschlagen, alle andere Smartphones mit weniger als 5"" sind mir schon zu klein (hatte HTC Legend davor). In diesem Punkt ist die Größe ein +-Punkt für mich.Die Verarbeitung finde ich in Ordnung. Wer Glas oder Alu mag, soll ich natürlich Prioritäten setzen - eigentlich nehme ich lieber Plastik. Die Batterieklappe kann man jedenfalls abnehmen, wenn sie kaputt oder verkratzt ist - auswechseln, oder gar eine aus Aluminium bestellen (einfach im Google danach suchen, gibt's auch).Hab iPod 4G und iPad und obwohl ich beide immer verwende, wollte ich beim Kauf von Smartphone wieder ein Android nehmen. iOS wirkt schon zu alt für micht, es langweilt schon richtig, dass es da keine richtige Neuerungen gibt.Andere Pros:- Unterstützung von SD-Card- Multitasking mit Multiview (zwei Apps gleichzeitig auf einem Bildschirm)- Google-Integration (keine Probleme mit Maps, Youtube etc. - diese wurden von meinem iPad einfach gelöscht)- Schnelligkeit (k.A. ob iPhone stärker ist, ich glaube, sie sind beide gleich stark), 2GB RAM- Stifteingabe (ich zeichne gerne und das ist natürlich ein sehr cooles Add-on)- abnehmbare Decke: man kann also nicht nur Hintercover abnehmen und wechseln, sondern, mann kann auch Akku wechseln (hatte bei HTC immer 2 akkus dabei, falls was schief läuft und ich ohne Saft bleibe)- Anpassungsmöglichkeiten durch Widgets, Apps, Launcher etc, sogar live-Wallpapers.- super schönes Bildschirm- viele Neuerungen, z.B. die ganzen Smart-Funktionen (beispielsweise wird die Ansicht sich solange nicht drehen, bis das Gesicht parallel zum Bildschirm bleibt -&gt; beim Liegen hatte ich immer mit anderen Geräten das Problem, dass das Bildschirm sich dreht. Bim Ipad ist es einfach auszuschalten, beim iPod und anderen Geräten muss man in die Einstellungen gehen. Oder die Gesichtserkennung, oder das Umdrehen zum Stummschalten (Musik etc. sind dann aus), oder kurz mit dem Hand vorm Bildschirm (in Standby) winken, und Aktualisierungen anschauen. Ich kann hier nicht alles nenne, was es hier gibt.Kamera und Sound sind in Ordnung, da merke ich nicht so einen Unterschied und für Fotos verwende ich sowieso eine richtige Kamera. Das ist übrigens nicht die schlechte Kamera, viele Kompaktkamera auf dem Markt machen schlechtere Fotos. Wenn man noch dazu die ganzen Sharingmöglichkeiten nimmt (posting, email etc.) - für gewisse Situationen ist so eine Kamera ist sogar viel besser.Contra:- (eben nicht für mich): die Größe. Kauft lieber gleich eine Garnitur. Wer wenig telefoniert - dem muss es egal sein.- plastikPreis: 590 Euro habe ich bezahlt, finde ich in Ordnung.",2012年10月1日 在德国审核

Hoffentlich keine 100000 Komentare jetzt !,"Habe 2 IPhone Modelle und 2 Samsung Geräte bisher, ich bin kein Technikfreak sondern nur Normalanwender.Mein ehrliches Fazit: Samsung mit Betriebssystem vom Apfel wäre (für mich persönlich !!! ) die Lösung. Wieviele umständliche Handgriffe ich täglich an meinem Note2 tätige, zähle ich bewusst gar nicht mehr. Besonders um Anwendungen im Hintergrund zu schließen. Bei beiden Systemen gleich schlecht Apfel wie Android der Musikplayer !Richtiger gesagt die Funktion Stücke unwillkürlich abzuspielen. Offensichtlich hat keine der großen Fachzeitschriften für solche Details ein Ohr, oder ich bin der einzige Handynutzer auf der Welt dem diese Sache auffällt . Habe 4 GB Musik drauf und wenn ich täglich die Möglichkeit wähle Musik (Mp3) unwillkürlich abzuspielen, kann ich davon ausgehen in 2-3 Stunden fast immer wieder die selben Nummern zu hören ! Bei Samsung etwas seltener zugegeben, bei gleicher Playlist.Android App's immer wieder auf Augenhöhe mit App's vom Apfel zu stellen ist ( für mich persönlich !!! ) einfach nur Quatsch. Android mag bei manchen App's etwas mehr Einstellmöglichkeiten bieten, reicht ( mir persönlich !!! ) leider nicht. Schon mal TomTom Navis verglichen ? Kalender ( nicht nur die schlechte Optik gerade Juni 2013 vom Apfel ) ? Von der Sprachsteuerung ganz zu schweigen.Mir persönlich geht es bei einem App. um das gesamte Drumherum (Design,zuverlässigkeit,Abgleich in der Cloud) und die überzeugt derzeit immer noch vom Apfel. Auch wenn's weh tut.Die Platte von den Androidjüngern "" gibt es schon länger oder kommt hoffentlich bald"" ist mir persönlich zu abgenudelt!Mein Fazit: Das Galaxy Note 2 ist bestimmt ein technisches Meisterstück aber als ""Best Ager"" habe ich jedesmal nach kurzer Zeit das Bedürfnis ein Gerät vom Apfel zu kaufen bzw. zu bedienen. Bin kein Angestellter des Apfels und bekomme auch keine Prozente und wenn dieser schnelllebige Irrsinn so weitergeht fliegen beide Systeme bei mir aus dem Fenster.

Standart Goliath,"Ich hatte innerhalb 6 Monaten folgende Geräte:HTC ONE XSamsung S3Samsung Note 2über die Technischen Eigenschaften wie Displayauflösung muss ich wohl nichts mehr schreiben. Es haben alle 3 genannten Geräte ihre vor und nachteile.Das Display des Note 2 wird als das beste von Samsung gelobt. Dies kann ich leider so nicht bestätigen. Das S3 war ein tick schärfer und hat viellll empfindlicher reagiert. Das Note 2 macht halt riesen Spaß mit dem großen Display und die Akkulaufzeit ist bisher klar auf Nummer 1 von allen Geräten die ich hatte.Der Stylus Pen ist echt nicht schlecht als Idee, mag auch sein das er viel besser ist als das im ersten Note verbaute Stylus.ABER, er funktioniert so gut wie nur mit Samsung Apps. Wenn der Stylus auf das gesamte Android System programmiert wäre, würde ich sagen das es echt ein Mont Blanc ist. Aber so finde ich es nur als Spielerei welche ich nach 3 - 4 Tagen nicht mehr benutzt habe.Die Multi-Window Funktion ist das wohl beste was das Note 2 Softwaremäßig anzubieten hat.Ich habe am ende das Gerät zurück geschickt. Warum? Weil es ein Samsung (billige Verarbeitung) ist mit Touchwiz (schlechte Software, HTC Sense wesentlich besser). Meist gibt Samsung nur 1-2 Updates und das wars. Da ist das Smartphone eigentlich noch sehr aktuell und trotzdem veraltet Samsung es strategisch indem es einfach keine Updates mehr bereit stellt. Das meine ich mit ""Weil es ein Samsung ist"". Man sollte als High Tech unternehmen nicht versuchen damit die Kunden zum neukauf zu animieren indem man einfach keine Updates mehr verteilt, sondern damit, neues auf den Markt zu bringen das man als Kunde auch unbedingt haben will (und das wurde oft genug beweisen das es möglich ist).Ich kaufe mir ja schließlich auch keine neue Grafikkarte nur weil die mit dem aktuellen Update läuft.Ich werde jetzt warten bis das Nexus 4 wieder bestellbar ist (leider ausverkauft), weil ich einfach keine lust mehr habe auf diese Spielereien von HTC, Samsung und Co. mit den Updates.Von der Hardware ist das Smartphone mit Sicherheit das wohl beste was es derzeit zu kaufen gibt. Wenn man kein wert auf die Verarbeitung legt, mich hat das viele Plastik was wirklich billig wirkt nicht wirklich gestört.",2012年11月23日 在德国审核
Region-Lock - nachträgliche Einschränkung der Funktionalität,"Wie aus der Presse zu erfahren, werden aktuelle Samsung Geräte mit dem sog. Region-Lock ausgestattet. D.h. eingeschränkte Möglichkeit, das Gerät im Ausland zu verwenden.Zwar behauptet der Samsung Kundensupport, dass ein mit einer lokalen SIM-Karte aktiviertes Gerät dann auch im Ausland mit anderen SIM-Karten funktioniert. Allerdings gibt es trotz einer solchen Aktivierung noch Länder in einer ""Black-List"", die weiterhin nicht mit lokalen SIM-Karten im GN2 zusammen arbeiten.Der Hinweis, das Roaming trotzdem immer noch funktioniert ist lächerlich. Bei den immer noch hohen Roaming-Gebühren im aussereuropäischen Ausland für Daten wird gerne auf lokale SIM Karten zurück gegriffen. Und das soll wohl zugunsten der hiesigen Netzwerkprovider reduziert werden.Begründung für meine Bewertung mit einem Stern: Das Gerät habe ich vor einem Jahr gekauft, als es neu auf den Markt kam. Nun ist mir mit einem neuen Update diese Region-Lock Einschränkung untergeschoben worden. Unter diesen Bedingungen hätte ich mir das Gerät nie gekauft und kann die Marke Samsung aus aktuellem Anlass auch nicht mehr weiter empfehlen. Wer weiß, welche Einschränkungen sich Samsung als nächstes einfallen lässt. Und wenn man nur an neue Android Versionen kommt, wenn man sich solche Einschränkungen mit einhandelt - nein danke",2013年10月4日 在德国审核
"Ganz OK, aber VORSICHT!","------------------------------------------------------Rezension vom 16. Juni-----------------------------------------------------------------------Ich werde an dieser Stelle bald noch eine ausführliche Rezension posten und werde auch mehr Sterne geben, aber bis es soweit ist, möchte ich an dieser Stelle meinem Ärger Luft machen und zur Vorsicht mahnen.Auf diesem Handy ist standardmäßig Google+ installiert, bei dem standardmäßig die Funktion ""Automatische Sicherung"" aktiviert ist. Ich kannte diese Funktion bisher noch nicht, steckte also meine 64GB Micro-SD-Karte voller Fotos ins Handy und meldete mich während der Einrichtung bei meinem Google-Account an. Irgendwann checke ich mein G+-Konto und es trifft mich fast der Schlag! Diese %""§#-App hat doch glatt hunderte meiner Bilder ins Internet geladen! Ich dachte, ich spinne! Die Bilder alle von G+ zu löschen hat ewig gedauert und einmal im Netz ist nun mal einmal im Netz. Ich bin STINKSAUER!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Neue Rezension--------------------------------------------------------------------------Ich habe mein Galaxy Note II nun seit einigen Wochen im Dauereinsatz und bin soweit einigermaßen zufrieden damit. Damit man meine Bewertung besser versteht, möchte ich vorausschicken, dass ich das Note II vor allem mit meinem vorigen Handy vergleiche, einem Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, das leider nach einem Sturz einen Displaybruch erlitten hatte.Positiv:- Geschwindigkeit und Responsiveness.Allein dafür liebe ich dieses Handy. Keine Verzögerungen bei der Bedienung, keine Hänger und keine Wartezeiten dank der leistungsstarken Hardware und Jelly Bean.- Hervorragender Bildschirm.Seit ich dieses Handy habe, kommen mir selbst 4.7""-Bildschirme klein vor, vom iPhone ganz zu schweigen. Der riesige 5.5""-Bildschirm des Note II ist ein Feature, das ich ab sofort nichtmehr missen will. Dazu ist dieser Bildschirm von eine atemberaubenden Qualität, was Schärfe, Helligkeit und Farbbrillianz angeht. Ich bin rundum zufrieden. Ein weiteres Goody, das auf dem großen Bildschirm basiert, ist das wunderbare Keyboard des Note II. Nicht nur, dass die Tasten im Portrait-Mode schön weit auseinander sind, es sind auch die Zahlen-Tasten, die einem das Tippen so viel leichter machen, da man dafür nichtmehr das Keyboard umschalten muss.-Tauschbarer Akku und Micro-SD-Slot.Dank des abnehmbaren Rückteils kann man sowohl den Akku tauschen als auch eine Micro-SD-Karte verwenden. Diese beiden Features fallen bei immer mehr Android-Geräten weg, was ich sehr ärgerlich finde.- Kamera.Die Kamera macht für ein Handy sehr gute Bilder, wobei bei schwächerem Licht auch die Bildqualität nachlässt. HTC und Nokia nehmen sich dieses Problems bereits an. Positiv fällt außerdem die Serienbild-Funktion auf, die es ermöglicht, Bilder in schneller Abfolge zu schießen. Zudem bin ich von der Qualität der Front-Facing-Kamera sehr positiv überrascht.- Fast keine Crap-Ware.Außer ein paar Samsung-Apps ist auf diese Handy fast keine Crapware vorinstalliert. Das war bei meinem Motorola damals noch ganz anders.- Ganz nettes Headset.Beiliegend ist ein weißes In-Ear-Headset mit drei paar Silikonaufsätzen. Die Fernsteuerung erlaubt die Funktionen Volume+/-, Pause/Play, Vorwärts/Rückwärts, Google-Suche. Für ein mitgeliefertes Headset ist die Soundqualität erfreulich gut, wenn auch nicht so gut wie die meiner Sennheiser CX400.--------- Negativ: --------------------------------------------------- Überall nur glitschiges Plastik.Das ist absolut mein Hauptproblem mit diesem Handy. Es sieht dank 100% Hochglanz-Plasik nicht nur so aus, wie wenn ich es für 99,99€ von einem chinesischen Straßenhändler erworben hätte, auch die Haptik ist miserabel. Gerade bei einem so großen Gerät habe ich ständig das Gefühl, dass mit das Handy aus der Hand rutscht. Wenigstens die Seiten hätten aus Aluminium oder wenigstens einem texturierten oder gummierten Plastik sein können.- Hohes GewichtDas Note II wiegt um die 180g und ist damit ein echtes Schwergewicht. Zusammen mit der Größe des Gerätes sorgt das Gewicht manchmal dafür, dass ich nichtmehr weiß, wie ich das Gerät halten soll, ohne einen Fingerkrampf zu bekommen (wenn ich beispielsweise einen Film aus dem Playstore anschaue).- Akku hält nicht, was er verspricht.An dieser Stelle muss man bedenken, dass ich davor das weltbeste Smartphone besessen habe, was Akku-Laufzeit angeht: Das Droid Razr Maxx hat eine Akku-Kapazität von 3300mAh, aber auch das Note II steht mit einer Kapazität von 3100mAh auch nicht schlecht da. Dachte ich jedenfalls. Nun ja, während das Maxx an einem Tag absolut nicht totzukriegen ist, kann man das vom Note II nicht sagen. Jetzt heißt es also wieder Batteriespar-Einstellungen ausbaldowern und Ladenkabel mitnehmen. Schade - sehr schade. Dabei ist die Akku-Laufzeit des Note II im Vergleich zu anderen Androiden sogar gut. Ich glaube, ein HTC One oder Ähnliches hätte ich nach ein paar Tagen zurückgeschickt. So wie der grandiose Bildschirm des Note II ist auch die Akkulaufzeit eines Maxx etwas, wovon man sich schwer trennen kann. Jedenfalls muss das Note II jeden Abend an die Steckdose. Nutzt man Akkufresser wie eine Navigations-App, kann einem der Saft auch schon am Nachmittag ausgehen.- S-Pen nicht so nützlich wie gedacht.Ich habe mir das Note II unter anderem wegen des S-Pen gekauft. Nach ein paar Wochen die Ernüchterung: So nützlich, wie ich gedacht habe, ist dieser Stift dann doch nicht. Es ist ein Gimmick, das ganz selten mal einen echten Mehrwert bringt (unbedingt sollte man sich die App S-Pen Voice besorgen). Was mich besonders nervt: Die Taste am Stift sind haptisch kaum zu erfühlen. Man muss also immer erst schauen, wo sie ist, um den Stift dann richtig greifen zu können. Außerdem ist die Spitze des S-Pen so gelagert, dass sie bei der Benutzung des Stiftes ein helles, rasselndes Geräusch hervorruft und dem Stift damit einen unpassenden Spielzeug-Charakter verleiht. Zudem sind die Touch-Keys des Telefons aus irgendeinem Grund nicht mit dem Stift zu bedienen - man muss also umgreifen und den Finger benutzen oder die Gesten lernen und anwenden, die mit dem Stift ausgeführt werden können - sehr ärgerlich.- Gorilla-Glas.Darüber lässt sich streiten - ich jedenfalls habe den Eindruck, dass dieses Displayglas leicht, SEHR leicht, reißt. Das Gorilla-Glas meines Razr war nach einem kleinen, harmlosen Sturz jedenfalls kaputt und auch im Bekanntenkreis habe ich etliche Fälle miterlebt, wo ein kleiner Alltags-Sturz zum Totalschaden des Displays geführt hat. Ich jedenfalls wäre froh, wenn man davon wegkommen würde, die Kratzfestigkeit über alles zu stellen und dafür die Bruchsicherheit zu opfern (weil hart=spröde). Mit einem Kratzer im Display kann ich leben - mit einem gebrochenen Display nicht. Ich glaube kaum, dass Gorilla-Glas-Geräte diesen Tests noch standhalten würden: [...]- Kurzes Ladekabel.Sehr kurz und eindeutig fürs Aufladen an PC oder Laptop gedacht. Ich musste ein neues, längeres kaufen, um das Gerät vernünftig an der Steckdose laden zu können.- Verarbeitung so lala.Clippt man die Akku-Abdeckung auf das Handy, bleiben kleine, unregelmäßige Spalten übrig, in denen sich Staub und Schmutz sammelt. Der Akku-Deckel ist außerdem nicht eben, sondern wellig und unregelmäßig, was man jedoch zugegebenermaßen nur sieht, wenn sich Objekte darin verzerrt spiegeln. Für 450€ gerade noch OK, aber hätte ich das Handy damals für gut 600€ gekauft, wäre ich echt sauer gewesen.- Sound könnte besser sein.Der Sandisk Clip+ ist ein MP3-Player, der ~40€ kostet. Aus diesem kleinen, billigen Plastikteil kommt ein Sound in einer Qualität raus, von dem Smartphones nur träumen können. Ich frage mich: Warum kann ein mehrere hundert Euro teures Smartphone wie das Note II da nicht mithalten?!- Wird am PC nicht als Harddrive erkannt.Sehr ärgerlich ist, dass das Note II nichtmehr wie eine USB-Festplatte erkannt wird, wenn man es per Kabel an den PC hängt. Zum Beispiel kann ich es jetzt vergessen, MP3s direkt auf dem Handy mit einem MP3-Tagging-Programm zu bearbeiten oder mit einem Sync-Programm den Handyspeicher mit dem PC zu syncronisieren. Das war bis jetzt immer ein gigantischer Vorteil von Android gegenüber iOs, aber der ist damit hinfällig. Sehr, sehr, schade, nervig und ärgerlich! Bei meinem Motorola Droid Razr Maxx ging das auch unter Jelly Bean noch ohne Probleme.Insgesamt ist das Samsung Galaxy Note II ein Handy mit einem herausragenden Display, guter Performance und guter Akku-Laufzeit - nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Begeisterungsstürme ruft dieses Smartphone bei mir aber auf jeden Fall nicht hervor. Es ist ein Gerät, mit dem man im Alltag gut über die Runden kommt, aber sich in den Details eine ganze Reihe an Mängeln leistet. Schade.",2013年6月16日 在德国审核
Korrosionsschaden nach 4 Monaten?!,"Da ich mit dem Samsung Note keinerlei Probleme hatte und die anderen Modelle der Konkurrenz mich nicht wirklich überzeugt hatten, kam für mich nur das Note II in frage. War bisher auch alles gut, tolles Display, gute Akustik etc...Von einem tag auf den anderen ging der Telefonlautsprecher nicht mehr richtig. Der Gesprächsteilnehmer war kaum noch zu verstehen. Also Gerät eingeschickt, dachte, dass das keine große Sache sein wird. Umso größer die Überraschung, als ich von der Lizenswerkstatt per Brief informiert wurde, dass das Gerät einen Korrosionsschaden hat, der nicht in die Gewährleistung fällt. Also entweder 250 Euro für die Reparatur oder Gerät unrepariert zurück. Ich Mail an Amazon: 4 Monate altes Smartphone, bin mir keiner Schuld bewußt usw. - aber auch hier konnte man mir nicht weiterhelfen. Also 444 Euro für den Ar.... und das, obwohl ich definitiv vorsichtig damit umgegangen bin. Weder in der Dusche, noch unter den Niagarafällen damit telefoniert. Es blieb nicht nachts draußen liegen usw.Für mich ist das ein Herstellerfehler.Ich werde mir das Smartphone unrepariert zurücksenden lassen und definitiv keine Samsung-Smartphones mehr kaufen......zumal das Note I, das jetzt als Ersatz erhalten muss, und gerade mal etwas über ein Jahr alt ist, plötzlich auch seine Macken hat. Das laden funktioniert nicht mehr zuverlässig, akustiksignal für Akkuladen ertönt, obwohl gar nicht geladen wird. Zwei Note, beide reparaturbedürftig - nene, kein Bedarf mehr.Achja, als Nachtrag die Antwort von Samsung auf meine Kritik:vielen Dank für Ihre Anfrage.Wir bedauern, dass Ihre Samsung Geräte einen Defekt außerhalb der Garantiebedingungen aufweisen und können Ihren Unmut darüber verstehen.Egal welche Marke, welches Modell, jedes Handy reagiert sehr empfindlich auf Wasser und Feuchtigkeit. Ein Feuchtigkeitsschaden tritt nichtnur ein, wenn Ihr Handy in einen Behälter mit Wasser fällt. Beispielsweise können auch in der kalten Jahreszeit schon starkeTemperaturschwankungen oder ein Telefonat im Nieselregen ausreichen, um einen Feuchtigkeitsschaden zu verursachen, der dasHigh-Tech-Gerät dann ausfallen lässt. Auch durch ein Telefonat im Badezimmer bei hoher Luftfeuchtigkeit, oder durch Schwitzwasser beisportlichen Aktivitäten kann ein Feuchtigkeitsschaden entstehen.Der Feuchtigkeitsschaden tritt oft nicht sofort auf, sondern erst wenn z. B. die Korrosion einsetzt.Die Gründe sind somit vielfältig und zeigen auf, dass ein Feuchtigkeitsschaden verschiedene Ursachen haben kann, egal ob Wasser, Cola,Wasserdampf, starke Temperaturschwankungen oder ähnliches. Die Flüssigkeit setzt sich in den Bauteilen der Platine vom Handy ab, undverursacht so erhebliche Störungen, bis hin zum Totalausfall.Wir hoffen, dass Sie trotz des Zwischenfalls unseren Produkten und Serviceleistungen weiterhin Ihr Vertrauen schenken.Tja, Wenn man so wenig Qualitätsanspruch an seine eigenen Produkte hat....",2013年10月5日 在德国审核

Das Warten hat sich gelohnt,"Endlich!Freitag Abend hatte Amazon für weniger als zwei Stunden das Note 2 mit Bestellstatus ""sofort lieferbar"" im Shop. Da habe ich mit Premiumversand sofort zugeschlagen (mit der festen Überzeugung, dass es sich nur um einen Fehler handeln kann - aber man weiß ja nie). Gestern Mittag (Montag 1.10) kam ein Paket an. Ich hatte selbst jetzt immer noch Zweifel, die anderen Shops redeten vom 19.10 (vllt. wurde aus Versehen ein Note 1 verschickt?) doch beim Öffnen die Erleichterung es war tatsächlich ein Note 2! Es scheinen also wirklich vereinzelt Note 2 im deutschen Versand herum zu geistern.Ich hatte jetzt 24 Stunden Zeit das Note 2 im Alltag intensiv zu testen. Viel zu kurz für einen wirklich guten Test, aber für erste Eindrücke reicht es allemal.Verarbeitung:- gut. Das Gehäuse ist fest und absolut verwindungssteif. Das Glas an den Kanten leicht abgerundet (sehr angenehm). Der Akkudeckel sitzt fest und knarzt nicht (und darf von mir aus auch gerne abfallen wenn ich das Gerät fallen lasse ;) ). Der Rahmen besteht aus dick lackiertem Metall (Alu?). So fest und stabil wie sich das Handy gibt, ist höchstwahrscheinlich alle Hardware wie beim Galaxy S3 auf einer durchgehenden Metallplatte aufgebaut.Die Tasten außen sind gut zu erfühlen und haben einen guten Druckpunkt.-Der Stift ist auch mit kurzem Fingernagel leicht zu entnehmen und rastet schön fest ein. Er liegt für seine Größe gut in der Hand. Der Knopf am Stitt könnte allerdings etwas höher angebracht sein.-Perfekt ist die Verarbeitung aber leider nicht ganz. Das Bildschirmglas ist bei meinem Gerät etwas weit unten in den Rahmen eingesetzt. Dadurch gibt es oben am Rahmen einen kleinen Spalt (ein dickes Blatt Papier breit) der jetzt schon Staubfänger spielt. Ins Display kann prinzipiell kein Staub gelangen (ist mit dem Deckglas verklebt) ist also nur ein minimaler Schönheitsfehler aber trotzdem unschön im Angesicht der sonst tadellosen Verarbeitung. Wenn ich mir die Toleranzen genauer ansehe die Samsung bei der Glas-Rahmen Verbindung eingeplant hat wird wohl auch manch andere dieses Problem haben.Bildschirm:-Der Bildschirm hat eine Pixeldichte fast genau wie das neue iPad (gut 260 ppi), Schriften sind also sehr scharf wenn auch etwas schlechter als auf dem iPhone. Er ist riesig. Doch nach nur einem Tag habe ich mich komplett daran gewöhnt und merke nur noch wie sehr mich die kleinen Bildschirme anderer Smartphones eingeschränken. Einen Weg zurück zu kleineren Bildschirmen gibt es für mich nicht mehr, egal wie hoch deren Auflösung ist.-Wichtige Neuerung zum alten Note ist die RGB-Matrix die zum Pentile des alten Note gerade bei kleiner Schrift auf weißem Grund einen deutlichen Unterschied macht. Alles ist scharf, keinerlei Ausfransungen oder Farbränder.-Die Blickwinkelstabilität ist perfekt und OLED typische Farbschleier (z.B. beim Galaxy Nexus) unter Winkel bleiben fast komplett aus. Auch die Grieseligkeit (ungleichmäßige Helligkeit, Streifen) auf vor allem grauen Flächen wie ich sie von meinen bisherigen AMOLED-Geräten kenne ist deutlich reduziert.-Weiß ist deutlich neutraler und nicht so blau wie bei vielen anderen OLEDs. Samsung bietet die Möglichkeit die Farbdarstellung des Bildschirms mit 4 verschiedenen Modi anzupassen und somit näher am sRGB Farbraum zu bleiben. Dadurch ist, wenn gewünscht, nicht mehr alles so übertrieben bunt. Ich nutze es nicht, denn außer bei manchen Photos sieht es ungezügelt einfach phantastisch aus. Besser wäre wenn Android und alle Apps nativ Farbprofile verwenden bzw. vorgeben würden. Die übertrieben wirkende Buntheit von AMOLEDs ist eigentlich ein Fehler der Software - nicht des Bildschirms.-Das Display ist ordentlich hell und auch im Sonnenlicht noch gut abzulesen. Die fehlende Entspiegelung ist daher nicht dramatisch. Man muss aber mehr darauf achten wie man das Display draußen hält. (IPS Panele spiegeln dafür diffus an der 2. Displayoberfläche durch den vorhandenen Luftspalt)-Im Vergleich zum Galaxy S (1) nimmt der Bildschirm Fingerabdrücke wenig an, dafür ist der Gleitwiderstand über das Glas gerade bei schwitzigen Fingern deutlich höher. Eine richtige oliophobe Beschichtung scheint es also nicht zu geben. Er ist auch nicht entspiegelt. Hatte Samsung Angst der harte Stift könnte auf Dauer solche Beschichtungen beschädigen?-Die automatische Helligkeitsregelung ist (mal wieder) Mist. Im unteren Bereich viel zu grob. Zum Glück kann man in der Notification Leiste die Helligkeit super einfach manuell einstellen.-Das neuste Gorilla Glas macht den Bildschirm kratzfest, das ist auch dringend nötig denn schon kleine Kratzer können den Spaß mit dem Stift leicht verderben. Fingerspitzen sind hier weniger empfindlich.Handling:- Das Gerät ist groß aber passt noch problemlos in meine normale Männerjeanstasche. Man spürt es recht deutlich (das ging mir mit meinen alten Telefonen am Anfang jedoch auch so). Es schränkt mich in der Hosentasche nicht in meiner Bewegung ein.- Endlich bequem mit zwei Daumen im Portrait Modus tippen, dass ist toll! Horizontal gehalten wird die Tastatur dafür schon etwas zu groß für zwei Daumen. An eine Bedienung mit einer Hand ist ohne Verrenkungen nicht zu denken. Die Tastatur kann verkleinert und an den Rand geschoben werden damit man mit einer Hand schreiben oder wählen kann, doch wirklich praktisch ist das nicht.- Rückseite und Rahmen sind sehr glatt. Das ist bei der Größe ein echtes Problem. Es passt noch ganz bequem in die Handfläche, doch man hat nicht mehr einen so festen Griff wie bei kleineren Telefonen. Muss ich es in einer Hand halten, so kämpfen meine Finger nach kürzester Zeit gegen das Abrutschen des 180g Boliden. 2 Stunden stehend mit dem Note rumspielen enden so in einer schmerzhaft verkrampften Hand. Das ist sicher leicht mit einer €5 Silikonhülle behoben, doch warum muss es überhaupt so glatt sein? Für mich ein klarer Designfehler.-Das Handy wird bei normaler Benutzung nur wenig warm. Nur aufwendige 3D Spiele und (sehr) lange Dowloads übers Handy-Netz erwärmen es merklich im oberen Drittel. Die Wärme verteilt sich scheinbar recht gut über das Gehäuse.S-Pen / Software:- Der Stift ist toll und für mich nützlich. Er ist super präzise und geschriebenes oder gezeichnetes erscheint mit variabler Linienstärke und sehr geringer Verzögerung auf dem Bildschirm. Ich benutze ihn auch in Menüs oder mit Finger schlecht bedienbaren Webseiten (super Hilfe) etc. Ausgesprochen gerne. Einziger Wermutstropfen ist, dass die Menü und Zurück-Tasten (fest eingbaute Touch Buttons) mit dem Stift nich bedient werden können. Mich hat das jedoch nicht sehr gestört. Die Handschrifterkennung ist ganz ordentlich so lange man bekannte Wörter benutzt. Doch die Tastatur ist für mich einfach 1000 mal schneller als ich jemalsmit dem Stift schreiben könnte.-Ein wichtiger Unterschied zu normalen Stiften ist auch, das das Gerät zwischen Stift und Hand unterscheiden kann. Im Note Programm kann man daher die Hand bequem auf dem Display auflegen und einfach weiterschreiben (umstellbar). Es merkt auch wenn ich den Stift aus versehen liegen lasse (gestern prompt passiert) und beschwert sich dann lautstark.-Samsung hat sich sichtlich Mühe gegeben Features einzubauen die den Stift nutzen. Doch die Software ist etwas Fehlerhaft. Gerade das beworbene (eigentlich nur im Kalender nützliche) Air View sorgt für Fehler denn zumindest bei mir denkt das Gerät manchmal ich würde den Bildschirm mit dem Stift noch berühren wenn das nicht nicht mehr der Fall ist, mit entsprechend ärgerlichen Folgen. Ist Air View deaktiviert funktioniert alles ganz normal. Das Note Programm, welches den Stift gut nutzt, versagt außerdem auf ganzer Linie wenn man es ohne Stift nutzen will. So muss man jedes Mal die Handeingabe manuell aktivieren obwohl doch der Stift eingesteckt ist und dann, wenn man den Stift wieder nutzen will, manuell aktivieren -nervig! Auch elementare Features wie copy und paste scheint es nicht zu geben. Was hat man sich hierbei nur gedacht?-Auch die tollen Multitasking / Pop up Programme sind fehlerhaft denn das dazugehörige Menü mit denen ich sie aufrufen kann ist nicht zu finden. Eigentlich sollte ein langer Druck auf die Zurück-Taste das Menü erscheinen lassen doch es passiert nichts. Ein Fehler meinerseits? Ein Dienst zu viel deaktiviert? Ich werde das noch weiter untersuchen. Popup Note startet jedenfalls (vorher aber einstellen) brav sobald man den Stift herauszieht und ist wirklich nützlich.-Insgesammt ist die Software und auch das neuste Touchwiz Interface jedoch wirklich gut und erweitert Android sinnvoll. Das kann man von älteren Versionen nicht behaupten. Ich habe jahrelang CyanogenMod (v9 + 10) genutzt welches sehr nahe am inzwischen ganz tollen 'reinen' Android orientiert ist. Samsung hat aufgepasst und alle guten Neuerungen hier übernommen. Auch Google Voice Search wurde integriert obwohl das unzuverlässige S-Voice noch mit an Bord ist (einfach deaktivieren). Es fehlt an nichts und an vielen Stellen sind die Funktionen sogar intelligent ausgebaut worden. Touchwiz ist zwar damit tendenziell etwas überladen aber trotzdem schneller zu bedienen und einfach besser. Ich war positv überrascht.Kamera:Ok, für einen Schnappschuss in Ordnung. Auf dem aktuellen Stand moderner Smartphones. Die Software gefällt mir gut. Man kann die Kamera App wie auch beim normalen Android aus dem Sperrbildschirm direkt aufrufen. Wichtige Kamerafunktionen wie Belichtungskorrektur oder Weißabgleich lassen sich nach Wunsch auf dem Bildschirm in der Foto-App ablegen. Das ist toll. Kaum Auslöseverzögerung. Guter Autofokus. Leider kein echter Auslöser am Gehäuse.Leistung:-Der Akku hält sehr gut durch. Feste Aussagen will ich dazu keine machen, da ich das Note erst zu kurz habe. Nur so viel: Ich habe heute frei und hänge heute nur noch vorm Telefon. Der Bildschirm ist seit 5 Stunden und 51 Minuten ununterbrochen an. Ich habe im Wlan Videos geschaut, gesurft (wlan und 3g), etwas gespielt, mit dem Stift rumgeblödelt, telefoniert, Fotos gemacht und vor allem diese Bewertung geschrieben. Der Akku ist jetzt bei 52%. Alle möglichen Hintergrunddienste inkl. GPS sind aktiv. Das ist deutlich besser als mein Glaxy S (1) mit 1800mAh Ersatzakku und auch als das Galaxy Nexus die ich beide schon intensiv nutzen konnte. Man kann den Prozentangaben aber nicht ganz trauen da das Sytem die Entladekurve des Akkus über die nächsten Ladezyklen erst noch kennenlernen muss (ich hatte es noch nie komplett leer). Ich werde berichten wenn es ganz leer war. Ich habe jedoch keine Angst problemlos über einen Tag zu kommen. Samsung bietet außerdem einen schnell zugänglichen Energiesparmodus welcher den Prozessor runtertaktet (und 'undervoltet') und den Bildschirm dimmt. Das Interface ist damit leider nicht mehr ganz so flüssig, surfen geht aber gut.- Die Leistung des Systems ist toll. Das ist Interface extrem flüssig und auch extensives Multitasking bringt das Handy nicht ins schwitzen. Von den 2 GB RAM sind nach Deaktivierung von ein paar nutzlosen Samsung Diensten (unter anderem S-Voice) und ansonsten alles möglichem aktiviert, auch so manchem extra-Hintergrunddienst aus dem play store bei mir ca. 800 MB belegt. Egal welche Apps gerade noch im Hintergrund offen sind: das System bleibt immer super flüssig und reaktionsschnell. toll!-Die Spieleleistung ist auf dem Niveau eines Galaxy S3. Einige Spiele sind noch nicht freigegeben, Asphalt 7 hat Performance Probleme.Insgesammt bin ich bisher sehr zufrieden. Die Software Bugs kann ich verkraften solange noch nachgebessert wird. Das Handy kompensiert durch seine anderen Qualitäten solche Patzer spielend. Die Größe ist am Anfang sehr ungewohnt vor allem da man erst noch versucht das Gerät genau so wie ein normales Smartphone zu halten. Heute merke ich die Größe im Gegensatz zu Gestern kaum noch. Einfach eine Frage der Gewöhnung.LG R.",2012年10月2日 在德国审核
Fantastisch (&amp;) innovativ!,"Update 08/2014:Inzwischen musste ich für mich feststellen, dass das Galaxy Note 2 tatsächlich der Höhepunkt der Samsung Galaxy Note Serie war.Die sehnsüchtig erwarteten Nachfolger konnten nicht nur die hohen Erwartungen nicht erfüllen, sondern brachten stattdessen eine Reihe von Problemen mit sich:Das Note 2 LTE hatte einen so schlechten Empfang, dass es für mich kaum nutzbar war: vielerorts kein Empfang und ständige Verbindungsabbrüche, wo das Note 2 (ohne LTE) keine Probleme hatte.Das Note 3 begeisterte zunächst dank des wieder sehr guten Empfangs und des tollen Displays. Aber häufige Abstürze trübten die Freude erheblich. Nach dem Update Anfang Februar 2014 fror das mehrfach ausgetauschte Gerät gar stündlich ein; das dringend notwendige Update ließ geschlagene vier Wochen auf sich warten, während derer der Samsung Service das Problem schlicht leugnete.Frustriert wechselte ich zum bis dahin von mir eher belächelten iPhone 5s, das deutlich weniger Hingucker-Features mit sich brachte. Schnell begann das iPhone jedoch durch seine sagenhafte Systemstabilität und wirklich funktionierende Funktionen zu überzeugen - und tut es bis heute.Ursprüngliche Rezension:Endlich ist es da, das Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - der Nachfolger des Überraschungserfolgs Galaxy Note.Das Note 1 war ein Jahr lang mein treuer Begleiter und noch kein Smartphone (von HTC TyTN über HTC HD2 und HTC Desire HD bis zum HTC Sensation) hatte mich zuvor so in Sachen Systemstabilität, Empfang, Sprachqualität, Funktionalität, Variabilität (microSD-Slot bis 64GB, 2500mAh Wechselakku), Performance und Usability überzeugen können. Und der S-Pen macht das Note zum Immerdabei- Notiz- und Malblock.Am 01.10.2012 lieferte Amazon gewohnt zuverlässig und pünktlich endlich den heiß erwarteten Nachfolger: Das Galaxy Note 2!Nachfolgend fasse ich die besonders erwähnenswerten Eigenschaften des Note 2 zusammen:Optik &amp; Haptik==============+ Das Note 2 in titanium grau wirkt wie gebürstetes Metall - erstaunlich edel und elegant.+ Die Verarbeitung ist hervorrragend. Minimale Spaltmaße, alles wirkt wie aus einem Guß.+ Der abgeflachte Rand des Displays verleiht der Verarbeitung einen edlen Feinschliff, es ist keine Kante zu ertasten.+ Trotz abnehmbarem Akkudeckel wirkt das Gerät stabil wie ein Monoblockgerät - ohne die damit verbundenen Nachteile.Echte Innovationen==================Das Galaxy Note 2 hat sie - die Aha-Effekte und Hingucker, die man bisher von Apple gewohnt war:+ Smart Stay - das Note 2 schaltet das Display erst ab, wenn man nicht mehr drauf schaut.+ Google Now liefert kontextsensitiv die zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt (möglicherweise) interessanten Informationen:-&gt; am Morgen die voraussichtliche Fahrzeit zur Arbeit-&gt; am Abend die voraussichtliche Fahrzeit nach Hause-&gt; oder die Fahrzeit zum nächsten Termin-&gt; das Wetter und die Wettervorhersage für den aktuellen Standort-&gt; den Umrechnungskurs der Währung am aktuellen Aufenthaltsort zur Heimatwährung (z.B. Britisches Pfund zu EUR bei Aufenthalt in London)-&gt; die aktuelle Uhrzeit am Heimatort bei Aufenthalt in einer anderen Zeitzone-&gt; ein Übersetzungstool zwischen Sprache des aktuellen Aufenthaltsortes und der Heimatsprache-&gt; interessante Orte (z.B. Gaststätten) in der Nähe-&gt; die nächsten Zugabfahrten in der Nähe eines Bahnhofs==&gt; Dieses Feature hat wirklich Potenzial und sorgt für Wow-Effekte. Die Suche zeigt einem an, wonach man gerade suchen will!An dieser Stelle sei aber auch erwähnt, dass Google diese Informationen natürlich nur dadurch generieren kann, dass jede Menge Kontextinformationen gesammelt und ausgewertet werden. Vom Datenschutzaspekt ist das sicher kritisch zu bewerten oder zumindest zu hinterfragen. Aber man kann das Feature ja auch deaktivieren.+ Tag-Buddy: In der Galerie werden in Fotos nachträglich Gesichter erkannt sowie die Wetterdaten und die Geoposition des Fotos gespeichert.+ Mit dem S-Pen können ""auf der Rückseite der Fotos"" Notizen hinterlassen werden.+ Bewegt man den S-Pen berührungslos über ein Bild (Position wird durch einen kleinen Punkt im Display angezeigt), so wird eine vergrößerte Bildvorschau angezeigt.+ Dank Allshare kann man auf einen Tastendruck Videos oder Fotos problemlos auf DLNA-fähigen Geräten (hier: LG LED-TV) wiedergeben.+ Smart Rotation (Intelligente Drehung) [Ergänzung]: Wenn das Note 2 aus vertikaler Haltung in eine horizontale Haltung gedreht wird, wird der Bildschirm nur gedreht, wenn der Benutzer seinen Kopfnicht mit auf die Seite gelegt hat. Dies erkennt das Note 2 durch einen ""kurzen Blick"" durch die Front-Kamera. Anwendungsbeispiel: Man legt sich beim Lesen mit dem Note 2 auf die Seite - der Bildschirm bleibt in der vertikalen Ausrichtung, obwohl das Note 2 horizontal gehalten wird. Funktioniert perfekt!==&gt; Insgesamt liefert das Note 2 so viele kleine und intuitive Innovationen, dass das Ausprobieren richtig Freude macht und ich sie hier noch gar nicht alle aufführen kann.Evolutionäre Weiterentwicklung==============================+ Der Quadcore-Prozessor mit 1,6 GHz kann fast schon nicht mehr als evolutionäre Weiterentwicklung bezeichnet werden. Der Geschwindigkeitszuwachs gleicht einem Quantensprung. Dies allein ist schon Grund genug für einen Umstieg vom Note 1.+ 2GB RAM stellen auch dem PowerUser ausreichend Speicher zur Verfügung. Mit 1 GB kam das Note 1 teilweise an sein Grenzen.+ Dank des 3100mAh-Akkus ist die Akkulaufzeit noch besser geworden und reicht auch bei sehr intensiver Nutzung bis zum Abend, bei normaler Nutzung auch durchaus für zwei Tage. Bei dem großen Display und der hohen Leistung sehr respektabel!+ Der S-Pen ist dicker, deutlich griffgünstiger und präziser geworden.+ Dank Air View wird die Position des S-Pen schon kurz vor der Berührung des Displays optisch angezeigt.+ Das Display wurde auf das 16:9-Fomat standardisiert und mit 5,5"" leicht vergrößert, ohne das Gerät nennenswert zu vergrößern.+ S Voice liefert eine ordentliche Sprachsteuerungsmöglichkeit.+ Die Benachrichtigungs-LED bietet eine dezente Möglichkeit, auf neue Nachrichten aufmerksam zu machen.+ Der Lautsprecher ist deutlich lauter als beim Note 1 und auch im Vergleich zu anderen Geräten sehr laut.+ Das Benachrichtigungsfenster (vom oberen Bildschirmrand nach unten zu ziehen) bietet jetzt bereits deutlich mehr Informationen.+ Die Kamera ist wesentlich schneller geworden und kann jetzt auch flotte Serienaufnahmen machen.+ Das Video-Hub bietet endlich auch die Möglichkeit, aktuelle Filme auf dem Note 2 zu streamen.Rückschritte============- Die Auflösung des Displays wurde von 1280x800 auf 1280x720 reduziert. Dies fällt zwar noch nicht negativ auf, aber stellt aus meiner Sicht die Mindestauflösung für ein Display dieser Größe dar.[Ergänzung: Dass die etwas geringere Auflösung nicht auffält, hat einen guten Grund: Das Note 2 hat jetzt eine RGB-Matrix mit drei Subpixeln pro Bildpunkt anstatt einer Pentile-Matrix mit nur zwei Subpixeln pro Bildpunkt. Technisch also ein Fortschritt!)- Der Startbildschirm fasst nun nur noch 4x4 Icons (wie z.B. Galaxy S3 und HTC One X) statt 5x5 wie beim Note 1. Dadurch geht der Vorteil des großen Bildschirms teilweise verloren und die Icons wirken schon übermäßig groß und haben einen sehr großen Abstand. Ich hoffe darauf, dass Samsung hier eine 5x5-Option nachliefert! Das 4x4 soll hier wohl auch dem verbreiteten Standard folgen.- Die edle und glatte Oberfläche des Note 2 machen das Gerät sehr rutschig.- Es können keine eigenen E-Mail-Icons pro Mailkonto mehr auf dem Startbildschirm abgelegt werden.- Das Samsung Social Hub gibt es nicht mehr, stattdessen wird Flipboard vorinstalliert. Das ist zwar schicker, aber Social Hub konnte einen unvergleichlich schnellen Überblick geben.Dies ist mein erster Eindruck nach zwei Tagen mit dem Galaxy Note 2. Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass das Note 2 richtig Spaß macht und eine tolle Weiterentwicklung des schon sehr guten Note 1 ist. Die Software macht zudem schon im Auslieferzustand einen sehr guten und stabilen Eindruck! Bisher ist noch kein einziges Problem aufgetreten.Der Vergleich des Galaxy Note 2 mit dem iPhone 5 (wie auch den meisten anderen Smartphones) macht aus meiner Sicht wenig Sinn, da das Note 2 aufgrund seiner Größe einfach in einer ganz anderen Klasse spielt. Wem das Note 2 nicht zu groß ist, der kann von der Größe eigentlich nur profitieren und wird in dieser Größen- und Leistungsklasse kaum eine Alternative finden.Dies soll ein erster und subjektiver Bericht meiner Eindrücke und kein vollständiger Testbericht sein, daher erhebt dieser auch keinen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit. Ich hoffe, ich konnte dennoch dem einen oder anderen mit meinem Eindruck weiterhelfen.UPDATE nach 10 Tagen Nutzung:============================Die Begeisterung über das Note 2 ist nur noch gewachsen:Die Akkulaufzeit ist noch besser als erwartet und einfach nur grandios. Auch bei intensiver Nutzung im Urlaub mit viel Internetnutzung über 3G, Betrieb als Hotspot, 2-stündigen Film über Google Play und 3G und ca. 16 Stunden ohne Ladegerät bleiben am Abend noch gut 20% Akkulaufzeit übrig. Noch nie konnte man so guten Gewissens das Haus ohne Ladegerät verlassen!DieMultiWindow-Funktion wurde mit dem zweiten Update nach wenigen Tagen nachgeliefert und ist bisher absolut einzigartig.Der S-Pen hat unendlich viele neue Funktionen. Genial ist die Bildvorschau im Videoplayer, wenn man mit dem S-Pen über den Zeitstrahl schwebt (hovert).Der Tag-Buddy in der Gallery lernt auch immer mehr dazu, so dass mittlerweile auch viele ältere Aufnahmen getaggt wurden. Dadurch kann man sich nun sehr einfach alle Bilder zu einer bestimmten Person anzeigen lassen. Im Internetbrowser kann man durch überschweben mit dem S-Pen die sogenannten MouseOver-Funktionen auslösen.Verschiedenen Personen kann man unterschiedliche Vibrationssignale als Anrufbenachrichtigung zuordnen.Eine sehr umfangreiche (englische) Zusammenfassung der zahlreichen neuen Funktionen findet man bei GSMArena [siehe Kommentare].Der Artikel dürfte auch für alle neuen Besitzer des Note 2 sehr interessant sein.Fazit nach einem Monat======================Die Faszination des Galaxy Note 2 ist geblieben, von Ernüchterung ist auch nach einem Monat intensiver Nutzung keine Spur.Insbesondere die Stabilität und Ausgereiftheit des Gerätes bereits direkt nach der Markteinführung sind angesichts der Fülle an neuen und innovativen Funktionen absolut beeindruckend. Bisher kam es nicht zu einem einzigen Systemabsturz. Auch der (seltene) Absturz einzelner Apps konnte der Stabilität des Systems nichts anhaben.Und nach wie vor enteckt man weitere neue Funktionen:- Bei eingehenden Anrufen mit unbekannter Rufnummer wird der Abgangsort (aufgrund der Vorwahl) angezeigt. Sehr nützlich!- Mit dem ""intelligenten Alarm"" bietet Samsung neben der Benachrichtigungs-LED eine weitere Möglichkeit, um eingegangene Nachrichten zu bemerken, ohne das Display einzuschalten: Beim Anheben des Gerätes vibriert dieses kurz, wenn neue Nachrichten vorhanden sind. ""Schneller Blick"" ist übrigens eine weitere Möglichkeit hierfür: Bei ausgeschalteten Display erkennt das Note 2, wenn die Hand sich dem Annäherungssensor nähert und blendet kurzzeitig die (zuvor eingestellten) Statusinformationen ein.- Die (für ein Smartphone) sehr gute Kamera überrascht mit weiteren innovativen Funktionen: Der Aufnahmemodus ""Beste Gesichter"" nimmt bei Gruppenbildern mit mehreren Personen vier Bilder auf und erkennt die Gesichter darauf. Anschließend kann die ""beste"" Aufnahme jedes Gesichts separat(!) aus den vier Aufnahmen ausgewählt werden. Das Ergebnis ist ein perfekt retuschiertes Bild aus den vier Aufnahmen. Geschlossene Augen und Grimassen sind damit passé!- Das Akku-Ladegerät hat Samsung ebenfalls verbessert und dem vergrößerten Akku angepasst. Der Ladestrom wurde auf 2A verdoppelt, wodurch sich die Ladezeit gegenüber dem Note 1 trotz des nochmals vergrößerten Akkus sogar verkürzt hat. Hier zeigt sich, dass Samsung beim Galaxy Note 2 sogar an die kleinen Details gedacht hat. Einzig der etwas lockere Sitz des Micro-USB-Steckers am Note 2 birgt hier Anlass für Kritik.- Der ""S Pen Keeper"" erinnert mit einem Alarmton daran, wenn man sich mit dem Note 2 vom liegen gebliebenen S Pen entfernt. Klasse!- Dank ""Easy Clip"" kann man mit dem S Pen bei gedrücktem Button einfach einen Bildschirmbereich in den Zwischenspeicher ausschneiden oder direkt an eine andere Anwendung senden.Die zuvor genannten Rückschritte haben sich im Angesicht der zahlreichen Vorteile und Innovationen weiter relativiert. Der Bildschirm ist dank der neuen RGB-Matrix gestochen scharf, das Social-Hub vermisst man nicht mehr, wenn man sich einmal an Flipboard gewöhnt hat und auch der auf 4x4 Icons reduzierte Homescreen stört nicht mehr wirklich. Zudem lässt der angepasste Formfaktor die Größe des Note 2 schnell vergessen.Samsung hat mit dem Galaxy Note 2 wirklich einen ganz großen Wurf gelandet, der dem perfekten Smartphone sehr nahe kommt!",2012年10月2日 在德国审核
Wichtig zu wissen für Migranten mit Apple-Hintergrund,"======================Warum vom iPhone wechseln?======================Es ist an sich an der Zeit. Apple ist heute ein Konzern der ungefähr noch so kreativ ist wie die Deutsche Telekom. Das Sagen haben dort jetzt die Patentanwälte, die Marketingmenschen und die Konzernstrategen. Meine Apple-Brüder wissen wovon ich rede. Vor zwei Wochen stand ich in Budapest im Regen bei 3 Grad auf der Straße auf der Suche nach meinem Hotel und Apple hatte mir gerade mit dem letzten Software Update Google Maps ohne Rückfrage gelöscht und wollte mich jetzt mit der Apfel-Landkarte partout nach Griechenland schicken (mein Hotel hieß Corinthia - Google kennt es natürlich auch in Budapest). Mich stört noch nicht mal die arrogante Preispolitik - ich bin beruflich auf Handy und Laptop angewiesen, also sind mir ein paar Hunnies alle drei Jahre vergleichsweise egal. Aber da im Regen war die spontane Entscheidung: jetzt reichts.======================Warum das Galaxy Note II?======================Ich brauche mein Smartphone wie gesagt beruflich (Freiberufler, Vielreisender), Spiele und Spielereien sind mir eher egal und ich gucke auch keine abendfüllenden Filme auf dem Smartphone. Trotzdem: der Bildschirm und der Stift!! Kann man damit vielleicht auch mal eben eine Notiz hinkritzeln, vielleicht sogar ein Protokoll erstellen (mit Audio und ein paar Shots vom Flipchart)? Das wäre ein echter Upgrade und das kann das iPhone definitiv nicht! Dann können vielleicht iPad und MacBook auch mal im Hotel bleiben.Oder man richtig entspannt damit Surfen, eine Präsentation durchgehen? Zwar noch Mäusekino, aber richtig große Mäuse.======================Dasist nach zwei Wochen intensiver Beschäftigung richtig gut:======================Im Grunde kann das Note II praktisch alles so gut wie das iPhone, einiges sieht noch dazu besser aus und nach drei Generationen iPhone (und fast 10 Jahren ganz im Apfelgarten mit iPad, iTunes, iCloud , iMac, iHastenichtgesehn) tut die Abwechslung richtig gut. Was mal innovatives Design bei Apple war geht nach ein paar Jahren richtig auf den Zeiger und ist nur noch altbacken, z.B das Holzregal für die Zeitschriften.Konkret sind diese Dinge richtig gut:- Der etwas größere Bildschirm ist ein qualitativer Sprung - für Surfen, Präsentationen, Kalender etc.- Handschriftliche Notizen und Grafiken: das funktioniert echt gut mit dem Stift und nach einiger Übung bleibt der Laptop immer öfter zuhause.- SD Card Slot, 64GB plus 12GB intern! Da kann man doch endlich das ganze Archiv mitnehmen und die Musik für unterwegs dazu- Die mit Widgets gestaltbaren Oberflächen (man kennt das als Apple-janer vom Laptop, aber das geht am iPhone so nicht)(Eine bedauerliche Einschränkung zu den handschriftlichen Notizen: die werden in einem proprietären Format abgespeichert - du kannst sie wieder nur auf dem Note II lesen - oder per Workaround und mit einem Workflow der einem den Spaß verdirbt in PDF umwandeln)Dazu sind einige Routinen und Designs einfach mal anders, auch schön. Ich mag z.B. den Samsung Wecker.======================Das spricht trotzdem gegen einen Umstieg jetzt:======================Wie gesagt, im Prinzip kann das Note II alles was wichtig ist. Aber wehe man ist durch Jahre in der Apple-Welt nicht mehr gewohnt, sich in irgendwelchen obskuren Foren Informationen und Tricks beschaffen zu müssen, sich dort für dumme Fragen beschimpfen zu lassen (so viele Trolle bei den Androiden!) und eine dicke Anleitung (elektronisch) vorgesetzt zu bekommen, die oft - objektiv linguistisch gesprochen - komplett und hanebüchen unverständlich ist. Es ist also richtig viel Aufwand, besonders das Syncen mit iCal, iTunes etc. (man will ja nicht gleich komplett umsteigen). Aber es funktioniert!Hier aber ein paar irritierende Erfahrungen des Umsteigers, z.B.:- Klar brauche ich jetzt auch einen Google Account, akzeptiert. Aber brauche ich wirklich auch einen Samsung Account - wieder ein neues Password, eine eigene eMail, meine Daten wieder bei irgendeinem Konzern?- Syncen mit iCal, Kontakte etc. geht, da bietet Samsung eine App an. Aber damit kannst du nicht ernsthaft Musik syncen, außer du verschiebst die Ordner von iTunes an einen anderen Ort. Also gibts da noch eine andere App (KiesMac), die kann aus iTunes auf Galaxy syncen - aber die läuft jetzt wieder nur, wenn die Samsung Ap davor deinstalliert wurde- Wo genau kauft man jetzt die Apps? Bei Google Play (ich will doch gar nicht spielen) oder bei Samsung oder wo? (Ich weiß das jetzt natürlich, aber das man sich solche Fragen stellt ist eine neue Erfahrung)Daneben gibt es einige geschmäcklerische Features die mag nicht jeder, etwa den ""Buddy"" der mir aufdringlich zuverlässig das falsche anbietet (z.B. Maps beim Einschalten von Roaming) nur weil ich es die letzten drei male so gemacht hatte. Ich will klare Bedien-Routinen an die ich mich gewöhne, schließlich benutze ich das Phone täglich und viel, da brauche ich keine beflissenen Helferlein (Karl die Klammer ist meine letzte Erinnerung an die alte Windows Welt - wegen Karlchen habe ich gewechselt).So, und dann gibt's zwei echte Killer. Ich bin mir sicher, das ist auch noch zu Lösen. Aber in der iWelt musst du halt nicht immer wieder irgendwas lösen und ein Workaround schaffen, da funktionieren solche Dinge:- Ich fahre zwei Autor, einen Audi und einen Renault. Im Audi verbindet sich das Note II. Ich kann telefonieren, aber ich kann nicht über das Auto auf die Adressen zugreifen. Also auch nicht mit Spracheingabe ""Anrufen bei Heinz Müller"" oder ""Navigiere zu Oskar Meyer"" sagen. Im Renault klappt gleich gar nichts. In den einschlägigen Foren werde ich auf den Netzbetreiber (hier: Vodafone) verwiesen. Aber ich habe doch die SIM einfach aus dem iPhone genommen und ins Note II gesteckt. Mit dem iPhone ging es immer.- Roaming: wenn das Note II den Netzbetreiber verliert bekomme ich regelmäßig im Ausland nur nach Neustart des Phones wieder eine Roaming-Verbindung. Das geht natürlich im Alltag auf Reisen überhaupt nicht.Ich meine dass ich auch diese beiden Nüsse knacken kann. Aber allmählich wird mir die Zeit schade und wie gesagt - bei Apple funktionieren soclhe und andere Dinge einfach und deshalb bereue ich den Umstieg. Ich probiers wohl noch einige Zeit, aber eigentlich denke ich wieder an die reumütige Rückkehr ins Apfelreich.======================Fazit======================Vieles ist persönlicher Geschmack. Ein paar echte Vorteile hat das Note II, konkurrenzlos ist die Bildschirm-Schiftkombi. Aber wer sich aus der Apple-Welt kommend darauf einlässt muss viel Zeit und Geduld mitbringen, es gibt richtig viele Probleme zu lösen. Je nach persönlichem Bedarf kann es sein, das sogar einige bisher als selbstverständlich gesehenen Funktionen (Adressbuch im Auto?!) einfach nicht gehen.",2012年12月20日 在德国审核
Leider nicht überzeugend,"Das Galaxy Note II konnte bei nahezu jedem Review namenhafter Magazine überzeugen und die Bewertungen hier bei Amazon sind ebenso positiv. Daher entschied ich mich, mir ein solches Gerät zu bestellen, welches mein nun über 2,5 Jahre altes iPhone 4 ablösen sollte.Verkürzter Hintergrund der Entscheidung:# Akkuleistung und Performance beim iPhone 4 nahmen in letzter Zeit deutlich ab, Apps starten bspw. recht langsam, müssen häufiger nachladen etc.# Ein iPhone 5 ist nicht innovativ, bietet einen eher kleinen Bildschirm, ist mit 679 Euro für 16GB einfach überteuert# Android seit Jelly Bean wirkt überzeugend: generell natürlich flexibler und offener, mittlerweile aber auch deutlich ruckelfreier als bisherigen Android-Versionen,...# Ein Nexus 4 (mein andere ""Favorit"") ist seit Wochen nicht lieferbar, ist mit max. 16GB nicht sonderlich gut ausgestattet, lässt sich nicht erweiternNun aber zum Galaxy Note II - positive und negative Aspekte:(+) Es hat einen tollen Bildschirm: Schwarzwert, Größe, Auflösung, Ausleuchtung -&gt; Super!(+) Die Größe ist absolut hosentaschentauglich(-) Das Gehäuse knarzt quasi überall und ist einem über 500 Euro teuren Gerät einfach unwürdig(-) Beim Abnehmen der Rückseite habe ich das Gefühl, dass ich diese oder das Gerät selbst schädige(-) TouchWiz ist optisch wenig attraktiv(-) Der Stift fühlt sich minderwertig an, klappert und der Druckpunkt der Taste ist miserabel(-) Die Lautstärke-Taste klappert deutlich(-) Der Homebutton hat einen schlechten Druckpunkt(-) Ergänzend muss ich leider festhalten, dass Android immer noch nicht so ""smooth"" läuft, wie ich es von meinem alten iPhone kenne. Chrome ruckelt z.B. sehr deutlich und bspw. beim Scrollen in den Einstellungen habe ich den Eindruck, dass gewisse Frames ""verschluckt"" werden und die Animation daher unrund läuftIch hätte mich sicherlich noch mehr mit Android beschäftigen können und wäre von vielen Funktionen bestimmt sehr überzeugt worden. Leider habe ich dieses Experiment nach kurzer Zeit abbrechen müssen, da Samsung vor allem an der Verarbeitungsqualität und der Liebe zum Detail, nicht nur im Bereich der Hardware, sondern auch bei der Software nicht überzeugen kann. Die Hardware auf dem Papier ist toll, die Funktionen ebenso. Beides wirkt auf mich aber eher lieblos zusammengebastelt.Da ich Apple weiterhin gerne den Rücken kehren möchte, suche ich nun weiter nach Alternativen. Vielleicht doch auf ein Nexus 4 warten, vielleicht HTC eine Chance geben… der Android-Markt ist ja groß genug.",2013年1月12日 在德国审核

Der Taschencomputer!,"Ich hatte das Note-2 kurz als Testgerät - das ist zwei Monate her, trotzdem kam mir seitdem jedes andere SmartPhone wie ein Spielzeug vor. Also habe ich nun mein Razr-i (und mein Nexus-7) verkauft und mir das Note-2 gekauft.Klar gibt es die ungläubigen Blicke bei dem Gerät. Manchmal auch Kommentare, hauptsächlich von iPhone-Dudes: ""So ein großes Telefon, das würde mich aber nerven"".Mein Replik: Das ist auch nicht primär ein Telefon, sondern hauptsächlich ein Taschencomputer. Wenn du jedoch nur telefonieren oder SMSen willst, reicht dir natürlich auch das iPhone...Gegenüber dem damaligen Testgerät sind mir bei meinem neuen Note-2 einige Verbesserungen aufgefallen; so ""wackelt"" die Lautstärketaste nicht mehr, und der USB-Stecker sitzt deutlich fester. Vielleicht habe ich also bereits ein überarbeitetes Modell erhalten (Kaufdatum März'13)?Mit dem Code *#12580*369# wird bei mir folgende Firmware angezeigt:- AP: N7100XXDMB2- CP: N7100XXDLK7- CSC: N7100DBTDMA1- RF cal: 2013.3.2- HW Rev: MP 1.301Obiger Code wird einfach über die Wähltastatur eingegeben. Natürlich gibt es noch weitere Codes - hier die nützlichsten:- *#0*# = Überprüfung der Hardware, z.B. Sensoren, LED usw- *#3282*727336*# = persönliches Nutzungsprofil- *#197328640# = Service Mode- *#0228# = Detaillierter BatteryStatus- *#12580*369# = Anzeige Firmware-VersionDas Note-2 wird im Alltag schnell zum mobilen Büro - mein Notebook vereinsamt langsam, da das Note-2 den PC nahezu vollständig ersetzt. Nur längere Texte wie diesen Schreibe ich noch am PC, aber auch dafür werde ich bald eine Lösung erwerben (z.B. Docking-Station mit Bluetooth-Tastatur).Ich muss allerdings zugeben, dass ich auch massiv in Apps investiere, d.h. wenn mir eine App nützlich scheint, dann gebe ich dafür auch gerne Geld aus. So habe ich z.B. Genius Scan um Dokumente zu fotografieren und als PDF in die Dropbox zu schieben; Zeiterfassung Pro um meine fakturierbare Arbeitszeit zu erfassen, Bli****.de um mich vor teuren Überraschungen bei der Fahrt zum Kunden zu schützen, die Pro-Apps von runtastic um mein abendliches Workout zu erfasssen/steigern, TuneIn als Radio, SketchBook, Photoshop Touch, Haushaltsbuch, BoxToGo usw usf. Und mit Titanium Backup wird regelmäßig ein Backup erstellt und nach Dropbox gepusht.Aber nicht nur die reinen Apps, sondern auch die vielen kleinen Helferlein machen das Gerät so produktiv:Mit ""SMS Backup+"" werden nicht nur SMS nach GMail gesichert, sondern auf Wunsch auch die Telefonate (wann mit wem wielange) in den GoogleKalender übergetragen. Sehr empfehlenswert ebenfalls ist ""Call Confirm"" von 7bit, das durch eine zusättzlich Abfrage verhindert, dass man versehentlich eine Rufnummer wählt. Mit ""AFWall+"" kann ich den Zugriff von Apps auf's Internet unterbinden. ""Clipper Plus"" speichert die Zwischenablage. ""Total Commander"" ist der beste Dateimanager. Mit SwiftKey schreibt man fast schon automatisch. Und so weiter - die Liste ließe sich beliebig fortsetzen, aber das soll ja hier keine Software-, sondern eine Geräte-Rezension sein ;-)Apropos Software: Das Gerät ist natürlich werksseitig mit Samsung-Apps vollgeklatscht; Einige der Apps mögen vielleicht sinnvoll sein, aber den Rest habe ich über TitaniumBackup einfach deaktiviert, u.a. AllShare, ChatOn, FlipBoard, GameHub, Google Play Books/Magazines/Movies/Music, Google+, GroupCast, Learning Hub, Music Hub, News Daemon, Reader Hub, Video Hub, Weather*, Yahoo*.Weiterhin habe ich Touchwiz gegen Nova Prime ausgetauscht. Leider habe ich keinen vorher/nachher-Vergleich gemacht, um den gesparten Arbeitsspeicher zu vergleichen, es wird aber wohl schon enorm sein; negative Effekte konnte ich bisher nicht feststellen.Die Hardware des Note-2 würde ich als Perfekt bezeichnen. Natürlich, es gibt immer irgendwie irgendwo was zu verbessern, aber das Gesamtbild entscheidet - und da hat Samsung aus meiner Sicht wirklich richtig gute Arbeit geleistet.Z.B. das Plastik-Gehäuse - man vorheriges Motorola Razr-i hatte einen megacoolen Alurahmen - sieht anfangs toll aus, aber wenn dann nach drei/vier Monaten langsam die Lackierung an den Kanten nachläßt… :-( Dieser unschöne Effekt tritt ja bekanntlich auch beim iPhone 5 auf.Gewöhnungsbedürftig ist anfangs auch die glatte Oberfläche; aber dafür rutscht es halt auch geschmeidig in die Hosentasche…Toll finde ich, dass die Home-Taste physikalisch ausgeführt ist und nicht lediglich als Soft-botton. Langer Druck öffnet die Liste der aktiven Apps, zweimal drücken startet eine Spracheingabe.Mein Fazit: Ich hatte bisher acht (!) Android-SmartPhones; aber mit dem Note-2 habe ich endlich DAS Gerät gefunden, mit dem ich rundum zufrieden bin und welches mir den höchsten Nutzwert bietet.Würde ich das Note-2 jedem empfehlen? Wohl kaum - wer nur telefoniert oder SMS/Whatsup schreibt, wird sicher auch mit jedem x-beliebigem Phone auskommen. Wer allerdings eine Art Taschencomputer sucht, ein mobiler Tausendsassa mit integrierter Telefonfunktion, der wird mit dem Note-2 sicher die richtige Wahl treffen.Ich würde mir das Gerät jederzeit wieder kaufen.",2013年3月24日 在德国审核
Bestes Smartphone!,"Dieses Smartphone hat eine gute Rezension verdient!!Noch nie hat mich ein Smartphone so beeindruckt wie das Samsung Galaxy Note 2!Ein 1A Gerät, wo echt nichts fehlt! Ich hatte es erst in weiß, war mal was anderes als immer nur schwarz. Nach einem halben Jahr stieg ich um auf ein Sony Xperia ZL, welches mir für die Arbeit kompakter erschien. Dieses überzeugte mich leider nicht so, so daß ich mir nach einer Woche wieder das Galaxy Note 2 holte, diesmal in Titanium Gray. Es ist einfach das beste Smartphone was der Markt zu bieten hat und kein Handy konnte das bisher toppen. Wenn man einmal im Besitz dieses Monstrums war, kann man sich davon nur sehr schwer lösen.Zur Optik:Hervorragende edle Verarbeitung, nichts wirkt billig. Die Farbe Titanium Gray wirkt besonders edel, durch das gebürstete Design. Auch die Farbe weiß macht was her! Es ist groß, dafür aber flach, passt noch gut in die Tasche! Besonders gut gefallen mir die LEDs vorn, die auf verschiedene Benachrichtigungen aufmerksam machen! Die Rückseite ist leider sehr anfällig für Kratzer, genau wie die Kamera. Die Kamera sitzt gut, daß man nie einen Finger im Bild hat.Zur Technik:Internet surfen geht einwandfrei, ohne Ruckler oder sonstiges!Spiele (z.B. Angry Birds) macht das Note 2 durch den mega Bildschirm und auch durch die Leistung zum absoluten Vergnügen!Fotos sehen auch sehr gut aus, bisher keine misslungenen Bilder! Knallige Farben, nichts zu bemängeln! Und schnelle Serienaufnahmen sind auch möglich.JA, man kann eine SMS mit einer Hand schreiben! Also ich kann es. ;)Der starke 3100mAh Akku hält für das große Gerät sehr lange, bei intensiver Nutzung einen Tag (bei Smartphones ja recht normal) und bei wenig Nutzung sogar zwei Tage.Navigation funktioniert sehr gut. Es wird sofort erkannt wo es hingehen soll, kein ewiges warten bis das GPS-Signal da ist. Durch das große Display auch sehr schön zu erkennen!Das einzige was etwas nervig ist, sind die zig vorinstallierten Apps, die kein Mensch braucht. Aber das ist ja Geschmackssache. Ich selbst brauche Sachen wie ""Learning Hub"", ""Google+"", ""Readers Hub"", ""Flipboard"" usw nicht. Aber durch den netten Go Launcher kann ich diese verbergen und schon sei es, als wären sie nicht da.Zur LED: Sie blinkt rot, wenn der Akku schwach ist, blau oder weiß bei Email/SMS-Benachrichtigungen, grün bei Ebay... Sehr praktisch, ein Punkt der mir extrem gut gefällt!Noch super ist die ""Smart Stay""-Funktion: Der Bildschirm bleibt an, solange man ihn anschaut! Super, wenn man einen längeren Text lesen will. Das Licht bleibt an, ohne daß man etwas tun muss.Was noch zu erwähnen ist, das das Displayglas absolut nicht kratzeranfällig ist. Mein weißes Galaxy Note 2 flog ständig in der Handtasche rum, zusammen mit dem Schlüssel und anderem. Nach einem halben Jahr war nicht ein einziger Kratzer zu sehen! Ich habe nie eine Schutzfolie drauf gehabt, da mich das nur stört. Das ist natürlich kein Freifahrtschein. Wer trotzdem eine Folie drauf machen will, soll das ruhig tun, denn schaden kann das ja nun absolut nicht!;)Das einzige, was man bei diesem Modell noch besser machen könnte, wäre eine kleine Kamerataste am Rand. Das wäre aber auch das einzige was ich zu mäkeln habe.Ich könnte noch über etliche andere Funktionen schreiben, aber das würde zu lang werden. daher beschränke ich mich auf die Dinge, die mir am besten gefallen!Ein absolut alltagstaugliches robustes Smartphone mit extrem vielen Funktionen, was noch super edel aussieht! Von mir eine absolute Kaufempfehlung!!!Das einzige Smartphone was mir danach noch in Haus kommt ist irgendwann das Galaxy Note 3.... ;)",2013年5月15日 在德国审核

Cool ein Handy mit dem man nicht telefonieren kann.,"Hallo.Es gibt eigentlich zu dem Handy nichts positives mehr zu berichten.Wurde in den zahlreichen 5-Sterne Rezensionen alles schon beschrieben.Daher hatte meine Frau ein Note 2 bestellt. Da zeitnah das Note 3 herauskam habe ich mich insgeheim damit etwas beschäftigt.Dort wurde ich auf die zunehmenden 1-Sterne Rezensionen aufmerksam.So nahm ich mal den Karton vom Note 2 und dort steht:Dieses Produkt ist nur mit einer Simkarte eines Mobielfunkbetreibers aus folgenden Ländern kompatibel:Alle Mitgliedstaaten des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums, Island, Lichtenstein,Norwegen, Schweiz, Andorra, Bosnien, Herzegowina, Mazedonien, Monaco, San Marino, Serbien, Vatikanstadt, Weiß Russland.So. Nun muss jeder für sich selber entscheiden.Nur der Hammer ist das alle älteren Modelle noch im nachherein mit dem Schlüssel versehen werden.Dazu wenn Interesse die vielen 1-Sterne Rezensionen des Note 3 mal durch schmökern oder:heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Region-Lock-Samsung-S3-bekommt-SIM-Sperre-per-Update-1972042.htmlheise.de/newsticker/meldung/Samsungs-Region-Lock-kastriert-wohl-doch-den-Auslandseinsatz-1970422.htmlMir tun jetzt schon die vielen Menschen Leid, die nichts mitbekommen von dem Mist,den Samsung da gerade abfährt und demnächst irgendwo in der Prärie auf diesem Planeten stehenund von einem auf den anderen Tag nicht mehr telefonieren können.Wir jedenfalls haben das Handy wieder eingepackt und zurück geschickt.Da wir uns jedoch an Samsung gewöhnt hatten, war die Frage : ``und nu``Ich bin schließlich fündig geworden und habe erst mal ein LG G2 bestellt. Dieses Gerät ist neu auf dem Markt seit dem 05.10.13 und zumindest von den Daten um einiges besser als dasNote 2. Vom Preis her um ca. 20% derzeit teurer.",2013年10月4日 在德国审核

"Wer suchet, der findet!","Seit über einem halben Jahr besitze ich schon mein Note 2 und noch heute bin ich sowas von zufrieden!Ich habe schon länger überlegt ob ich wieder mal auf ein Android- Handy umsteigen soll, aber nie das passende Handy dafür gefunden. Als mein Bruder dann plötzlich mit seinem gigantischen Galaxy Note vor mir stand, konnte ich das Handy ausgiebig testen und war hin und weg. Sogar die Größe schien mir nicht unpraktisch!Wenig später erschien dann der Nachfolger, das Galaxy Note 2... Und ich wusste... KAUFEN!Und sogar heute noch, wo doch schon neuere und modernere Handys auf den Markt kamen, spricht für mich immer noch alles für mein Note 2!Mag ja sein dass die Pixeldichte, die Auflösung, die Funktionen usw. der einzelnen HandyŽs zugenommen hat, aber ich finde immer wieder Punkte, die mir bei meinem Note 2 besser gefallen!Besonders hervorzuheben sei hier der riesengroße Akku, der bei mir in der Regel 2-3 Tage(!) durchhält... Da kann meiner Meinung nach noch kein derzeitiges Handy mithalten.Okay, die Größe scheint jetzt vielleicht für ein Smartphone doch etwas zu groß zu sein, mit einer Hand lässt es sich nämlich kaum bedienen. Aber auch hier habe ich mich an die Größe gewöhnt und freu mich immer wenn ich anderen auf dem riesigen Bildschirm Videos, Fotos etc. zeigen kann!Die Stiftbedienung ist etwas, das ich nur selten brauche, aber sich oft schon als sehr nützlich erwiesen hat!Bei der Performance gibt es ABSOLUT NICHTS ZU MECKERN!!! Es läuft alles, zu jeder Zeit und in jeder Situation flüssig - kein Ruckeln, kein Hackeln - NICHTS! Absolut perfekt!Die Kamera schießt tolle Fotos, sogar der Blitz ist für Nachtaufnahmen sehr gut geeignet!Die Nutzeroberfläche von Samsung gefällt mir wahnsinnig gut und lässt sich wunderbar intuitiv bedienen... Rechts unten die ""Zurück""- Taste, links unten die ""Optionen""- Taste und in der Mitte der Home- Button... einfach toll zu bedienen!FAZIT: Finde ich etwas das mich stört an meinem Galaxy Note 2? Die Antwort ist derzeit: Nein! Für meine Verhältnisse und für meinen Gebrauch ist es für mich das derzeit beste Handy am Markt! Die Größe wäre da vielleicht der einzige kleine (oder ""große""...:-)) Kritikpunkt... und sogar der hat mehr Vorteile als Nachteile, denn einstecken lässt sich das Smartphone immer noch locker ohne zu stören!Irgendwie messe ich derzeit alle aktuellen Smartphones (und die noch kommen werden) an meinem Galaxy Note 2...""Wie sieht es mit dem Akku aus?"" --- Ja, das und das Handy ist schick, hält aber nicht so lange durch!""Wow, das Handy sieht gut aus!"" --- Ja, mag ja sein, aber es hat kein Blinklicht für Benachrichtigungen, und mein Note 2 ist auch sehr schön.""Hey, das Handy hat eine 13 Mil. Pixel- Kamera!"" Ja ja, aber dafür ist kein Stift dabei mit dem ich schreiben kann. ...Egal, welches Smartphone auch rauskommt, ich finde immer wieder Punkte die mein Note 2 besser macht! Für mich ist es derzeit das rundeste und funktionellste Smartphone auf dem Markt - und sowas braucht nunmal Platz, um die Größe schon erklären zu können! ;-)",2013年5月16日 在德国审核

Genau das richtige Gerät - Vorsicht Region-Lock soll kommen,"Nach anfänglichen Schwierigkeiten mit dem Gerät, da mein W-Lan-Router TP-Link TL-MR3420 1.

SAMSUNG und TP-Link konnten das Problem nicht beheben.Ich hab mein Galaxy Note 2 nun schon seit mehr als 6 Monaten und bin sehr zufrieden. Das Gerät ist für mich Navigationssystem, MP3- und Video-Player, Lux-Meter, Taschenlampe,Fotoapparat, Terminkalender, Notizblock, eBook-Reader und natürlich auch Telefon.Jetzt habe ich der Presse gelesen, dass mit dem nächsten Update Samsung das Region-Lock aufspielen wird und damit die freie Wahl des Providers eingeschränkt wird. Sollte dies tatsächlich so kommen, verliert das Gerät deutlich an Wert. Also Vorsicht, wer sich ein neues Gerät kauft, muss damit rechnen, dass man die SIM-Karte von SAMSUNG gesperrt wird, bzw. das beim nächsten Update die SIM-Karte nicht mehr funktioniert -&gt; siehe Galaxy Note 3 Rezessionen.

Und siehe da, nach dem Update zeigt der Samsung Taskmanager einen Systemspeicher von exakt 16 Gb an! Der wirkliche Wert ist bei einer Speicherangabe von 16 Gb 10,46 Gb. Hier sollen wohl Beschwerden von Kunden entgegengetreten werden. Ist natürlich normal das der tatsächliche Wert auf Grund der Berechnung niedriger ausfällt.

"Es kann fast alles, aber... Details, die z.B. iPhone5 besser macht","Hallo,da ich jemand bin, der immer sehr genau vergleicht und ausprobiert, bevor er eine größere Anschaffung tätigt, wollte ich auch diesmal einen persönlichen Vergleichstest durchführen, bevor ich mich für ein neues Smartphone entscheide. Zuerst stand das iPhone5 alleine auf der Liste, doch die Ankündigungen des Note 2 sowie Erfahrungen mit dem Note 1 ließen mich zögern.Nun habe ich 14 Tage lang beide Geräte (Note 2 und iPhone 5) mit mir herumgetragen und versucht, alle meine täglichen Tätigkeiten parallel mit beiden durchzuführen.Als Ergebnis vorweg: Das Note 2 hat gewonnen und ich werde bei diesem bleiben.So viele Dinge sind beim Note 2 toll gelöst, die Liste der Features ist sehr lang. Technisch vermisst man eigentlich nichts bei diesem ""Phablet"". Da ich auch oft Videos bzw. Bilder mache und betrachte, ist ein großer Bildschirm genial. Ich hatte vorher das Galaxy Nexus und dachte dabei schon: ""Kleiner geht nimmer"" :-).Der Bildschirm ist nicht so hell wie beim iPhone, aber wenn man nicht direkt vergleicht, aber sicher ausreichend. Scharf und knackig ist er in jedem Fall. Selbst die etwas kräftigen Farben kann man auf ""natürlich"" stellen, wenn man möchte. Dann kommt die Darstellung meiner Ansicht nach sehr nahe an das iPhone heran, was für mich wirklich einen genialen Bildschirm hat. Wenn er nicht so klein wäre...Stifteingabe ist für mich nicht Tagesgeschäft, funktioniert aber hervorragend. Besser als bei allen Geräten zuvor. Die Power im Gerät reicht sogar für Multi-Screen (also zwei Apps parallel) oder der live(!) Vorschau der aufgenommenen Videos (8 auf einmal).Die vielen technischen Helferlein machen Spass: Näherungssensor, automatisches Anrufen durch Bewegung zum Ohr, Bewegungssteuerung für wichtige Funktionen. Das GPS ist spitze.WLAN konnte ich direkt vergleichen, das iPhone war meistens etwas schneller beim Wechsel von einem Netz zum nächsten (habe zuhause pro Stockwerk ein eigenes). Den Empfang insgesamt fand ich beim Note 2 besser.Geschwindigkeit ist bei beiden keine Frage, wobei aber das Scrolling auf dem iPhone doch immer noch einen Tick flüssiger geht als beim Note 2 (z.B. in Emailliste, Amazonrezensionen mit der App).Auch SAMSUNGS TouchWiz macht Vieles richtig. Ein anderer Rezensent schrieb ""da wurde mitgedacht"". Stimmt. Meistens.Jetzt kommen wir zum ""aber""; Details, die mich wirklich verärgern:1. Warum um Himmels Willen baut SAMSUNG einen Kalender, den man in der Tagesansicht öffnen kann, der aber nicht den aktuellen Tag anzeigt?!? Er steht immer auf dem zuletzt angeschauten, als so gut wie immer auf ""gestern"". Hier hat Apple eindeutig besser mitgedacht. Auch positioniert der iPhone Kalender die aktuelle Stunde.Zum Glück kann man das durch andere Kalender-Apps wiedergutmachen.2. Outlook-Synchronisation: Ein Trauerspiel bei Android, auch Samsung's Kies macht da keine Ausnahme. Synchronisieren ist ein Graus. MyPhoneExplorer tut das meiste ganz ordentlich, aber warum muss man hier wieder eine andere App bemühen? SAMSUNG, bitte mitdenken! Für ein Business-Smartphone ist Google keine Option, ich will und darf meinen Geschäftskalender nicht nach Google kopieren (Sicherheit!). iPhone: An PC anschließen, iTunes geht auf, ein Häkchen setzen und synchronisieren. Fertig. In ca. 10s. Ohne Probleme, alles da.3. Nochmal Kalender: Beim iPhone wechselt der Kalender von der Tagesansicht zur Wochenanzeige, wenn man das Gerät in die Horizontale dreht. Cool. Apple hat mitgedacht. Beim Note 2 zeigen die meisten Apps dann nur einen lächerlich breiten Tag an. So ein großer Bildschirm, den man besser nutzen könnte.4. Vorschau aktueller Benachrichtigungen (Termine, SMS, Email) auf dem Lock-Screen: Apple iOS kann das und es sieht cool aus (und sehr nützlich bei der Arbeit). Der Bildschirm geht sogar für ein paar Sekunden automatisch an, wenn eine neue Nachricht kommt. SAMSUNG hat dagegen einen ebenfalls sehr coolen Lauftext unten auf dem Sperrbildschirm. Doch was kann man da anzeigen? Aktien, News oder Facebook. Warum nicht auch EMail oder Termine???5. EMail: Warum öffnet eine EMail in einer Zoomstufe, dass man nur einen kleinen Ausschnitt sehen kann und in alle Richtungen scrollen muss? Der Bildschirm wäre groß genug, um mit einer Vollbildanzeige der ganzen Mail zu starten (zumindest als Option). Für Internetseiten kann ich das auch einstellen, warum nicht bei EMails? Lustigerweise macht es das iPhone genau so, obwohl hier der Bildschirm doch fast immer zu klein ist.Zusammenfassend bleibe ich, wie gesagt, beim Note 2, da die Größe des Bildschirms für mich das Wichtigste ist. Außerdem kann man (zum Glück) viele Unzulänglichkeiten durch andere Apps beheben. Android ist moderner, frischer, lebendiger. Es gibt so viele tolle Widgets, so dass man auf den sieben Home-Screens eigentlich alles wichtige auf einen Blick sehen kann.Ich kann aber nur empfehlen, das Teil zumindest ein paar Tage zu testen. Es ist schon ein großer Brocken, der nicht in jede Tasche passt.Viele Grüße.",2012年10月23日 在德国审核
Im Büro zuhause -  das Arbeitstier Galaxy Note II,"Habe das Note jetzt mittlerweile seit ca einer Woche und möchte meine Meinung kurz in Worte fassen.Kurz zur Handhabbarkeit meiner Rezension: seit 1999 habe ich ca 100Mobiltefone gehabt und das ist eher nach unten abgerundet. Nach einem knappen Jahr iPhone 4s habe ich mich entschieden mal was anderes zu versuchen.Verpackung und Inhalt:Das Gerät kommt in der samsungtypischen kleinen Verpackung. Das ist gut so, so wird nicht unnötig Abfall erzeugt. Wer mal ein SonyEricsson P900 oder P910 oder ähnliche hatte, weiß wovon ich spreche.In der Verpackung liegt das Gerät samt Akkudeckel und Akku.Zudem sind ein gut verarbeitetes Headset, ein Datenkabel und ein Ladestecker sowie div. Anleitungen enthalten.Verarbeitung:Wer hier mitliest hat festgestellt, dass viele Vergleiche bezüglich der Wertigkeit zwischen dem iPhone5 und dem Note gemacht wurden. Einen Vergleich hier wird das Note natürlich verlieren und das muss es auch. Denn es wurde lediglich Plastik für die Schale verwendet. Hier muss man sich jedoch den Nutzwert von Plastik vs. Edelstahl/Glas zu fokusieren. Wenn das selbe Gerät in der Ausführungsart eines iPone4s dargestellt worden wäre, würden wir mit über 220g (geschätzt) in der Hand leben müssen. So ist das Gerät trotz der Größe immernoch angenehm zu tragen.Der Akkudeckel sitzt gut, wenn auch nicht bombenfest (Freisetzung kinetischer Energi 1.Satz der Mechanik ;) ). Das Gehäuse knarzt hingegen nicht die Bohne.Was ich jedoch als positiv empfinde ist der glatte Akkudeckel, der wider der letzten Rezensionen nicht zum Rutschen einläd. Im Gegenteil, durch die glatte Oberfläche wird eine Art Adhäsion geschaffen und das Handy klebt nahezu an der Hand.Design:Das ist wie immer Geschmackssache. Ich finde die Anlehngungen an das S3 in Ordnung, da das ja das Flagschiff bereitstellt und somit auch die Designsprache von Samsung prägt.Die Größe:Jaja, hier will ich es auch mal ansprechen, auf die Größe kommt es sehwohl an.Jedem der dieses Gerät bestellt sollte bewusst sein, das es groß ist... sehr groß.Im Vergleich zum S3 ist es riesig. Aber dessen sollte man sich immer gewahr sein, wenn es um das Note geht.Am Kopf sieht es natürlich entsprechend deplaziert aus, da muss man mit Hohn rechnen.Aber wenn die Kollegen mal gesehen haben was das ""Frühstücksbrettechen"" so alles kann, halten die schnell die Klappe ;)In der Hosentasche ist in meiner Levis sowie in meiner Boss-Chino und Anzughosen sowieso genügend Platz, selbst mit der Hülle.Bedienung:Was soll ich hier noch sagen? Die Bedienung geht flott von der Hand, wenn auch nicht ganz so schnell wie die beim Galaxy Nexus (einfach unglaublich). Dennoch kann ich nur selten Verzögerungen wahrnehmen. Primär bei komplexen Webseiten und mit Bilder übersähten Emails. (Wesentlich besser als beim Note1)Das Android OS bietet auch ob der Anpassung von Samsung eine imense Anzahl an Anpassungsmöglichkeiten. Eine hohe Zahl von Widgets ist bereit vorinstalliert.Die Reaktionszeit und präzision des Touchscreen ist hervorragen und in jedem Fall identlisch mit der Empfindlichkeit des iPhones. Zudem ist die Farbwiedergabe der Wahnsinn. Toller Display!S-Note in Verbindung mit dem Stift macht wirklich Sinn, denn die Funktionen sind erheblich verbessert wordem im Gegensatz zum Note1, welches ich 3 Wochen besaß.Neue Features (z-B. das Aktivieren einer Notiz beim zücken des Stifts) wurden gut umgesetzt. Hier leistet Samsung gute Arbei.Durch die Angepasste Hardware (manche haben ja den Pixelverlust zum Note1 bemängelt) in Sachen Display hat zu Folge, das wesentlich mehr Apps für das Note2 zur Verfügung stehen, da diese schon für das S3 und das Galaxy Nexus angepasst werden mussten.Was mich wirklich stört ist das Fehlen des 5x5 Raster und ja ich habe alternative Launcher versucht, diese laggen bei mir aber irgendwie immer und das ist viel schlimmer.Was mir des öfteren Probleme bereitet ist die Texteingabe. Hier wurde nicht komplett zuende Gedacht. Oft will ich bei Texteingaben etwas korrigeren, dies geht aber nur schwer, weil die Tastatur die entsprechende Zeile verdeckt. Zudem kann man den Cursor nicht immer dorthin platzieren wo ich es gerne hätte. Evt. fällt das Samsung ja auf und liefert nach.Akku:Ich bin sowas nicht gewöhnt, das Note hält schon bei nicht konditioniertem Akku mehr als ein Tag durch und ich spiele gerne am Handy rum :) Wenn ein paar Wochen verstrichen sind, wird dies mit Sicherheit sogar noch besser.Hoffentlich vergesse ich nicht zu laden.Empfang/Telefonie:Mit o2 absolut top! Mehr gibt es nicht zu sagen!Unterhalung:Komplexe Spiele wie Modern Combat 3 sind spizte und ruckelfrei zu spielen.Videos werden auf dem Riesendisplay sehr gut wieder gegeben.Der MP3 Player macht wirklich eine gute Figur. Ton und bedienbarkeit sind ausgezeichnet.Produktivität:Das war der Grund warum ich von iPhone (unter anderem auch weil meine 7jährige Nachbarin jetzt auch ein iPhone hat) auf Android gewechselt habe. Jetzt kann ich Daten auf das Gerät schaufeln ohne groß iTunes zu bemühen. Zudem kann ich schnell PDFs mit Notizen versehen.PDFs/XLS und so weiter werden unverzüglich geladen und sind zum editieren bereit.Der Kalender mit dem neuen Airview ist einfach spitze handzuhaben.Fazit:Das Gerät kann bis auf ein paar Kleinigkeiten voll überzeugen.Es ist in der Produktivität aufgrund des größen Displays und des Stylus unangefochten!Wer mit der Größe und dem Spott leben kann, wird reichlich belohnt mit dem besten Businessgerät der Welt!",2012年10月31日 在德国审核

da hat jemand mitgedacht...,"Zuerst 2 Punkte die immer wieder in den Rezensionen angesprochen werden. Da wäre einmal die Größe und die eventuell komplizierte Bedienung. Zur Größe muss ich klar sagen dass ich die Größe ideal finde. Endlich kann man Webseiten lesen ohne lästiges Scrollen und dauerndes Zoomen. Klar hat die Größe auch gewisse Nachteile. Wenn ich etwa Rennradfahren gehe muss ich echt überlegen wo ich das Teil unterbringe, aber mit etwas gut will ist das schon in den Griff zu bekommen.Was die Bedienung betrifft kann ich nicht ganz verstehen dass das jemanden zu kompliziert ist. Ja man kann sehr vieles einstellen, muss man aber nicht, theortisch kann man einfach lossurfen und telefonieren ohne was zu tun. Was ich mir wünschen würde das wäre, dass die verschiedenen Einstellungen besser erklärt werden. Klar kann man alles googeln, aber das könnte vielleicht verbessert werden.Nun zu meinen ...da hat jemand mitgedacht:Mitgedacht die erste: wer kennt das nicht: man telefoniert und dann sollte man etwas notieren, etwa eine Telefonnummer oder ähnliches. Blöderweise hat man weder Kugelschreiber noch Zettel bei der Hand. Beim Note zieht man während dem Gespräch den Stift heraus und schwupp erscheint ein virtuelles Blatt auf dem man dann handschriftlich etwas notieren kann - Genial!!Mitgedacht zum zweiten: Man macht ein Foto und üblicherweise werden alle Daten dieses Bildes mit gespeichert und lassen sich später anschauen. Doch was wenn man sich notieren will bei welcher Gelegenheit dieses Bild gemacht wurde. Etwa dass dieses Bild die Tante Miezi voll in Fahrt zeigt.Und das geht dann so: Man sagt Notiz hinzufügen und schon dreht sich das Bild um und jetzt kann man auf der Rückseite mit Handschrift was draufschreiben - einfach phantastisch.Mitgedacht die dritte ist da schon fast banal: Wer kennt das nicht, man möchte ein Foto von sich machen, leider ist niemand da der es machen könnte. Dafür wurde der Selbstauslöser erfunden. Draufdrücken, rennen und erstarren...bis es klick macht.Mitgdeacht geht das dann so: Note 2 in Stellung bringen, sich selbst in aller Ruhe positionieren und dann sagt man "" Klick"" und das Foto ist gemacht, noch ein Foto? Einfach nochmals "" Klick "" rufen und weiter geht der Spass - Genial!Ja gibt es denn gar nichts zu meckern, wirklich alles perfekt. In der Tat gibt es nur 2 Punkte die noch fehlen. Einen KFZ Halter mit integriertem Ladegerät wie es für das Note gibt fehlt noch. Die 2. Sache ist das mit der Led. Es wurde jetzt eine Led Lampe oben integriert welche auch mit verschiedenen Farben diverses anzeigt. Hier würde ich mir einen schnelleren Blinkintervall wünschen, die blinkt mir einfach zu langsam - Ende. Das wars, der Rest ist einfach "" ...da hat jemand echt mitgedacht.."" und ein Produkt geschaffen was fast makellos ist.",2012年10月20日 在德国审核
Auch nach drei Monaten bin ich vom Note 2 immer noch begeistert,"Ich benutze das Note 2 seit nunmehr drei Monaten. Zuvor hatte ich das Note 1. Mit dem war ich eigentlich sehr zufrieden. Da allerdings der Akku des Note 1 oft keinen ganzen Tag durchhielt, obwohl ich kein Intensivnutzer bin, habe ich es meinem Sohn geschenkt und mir das Samsung S3 zugelegt. Bei diesem habe ich dann aber den S-Pen, an den ich mich so gewöhnt habe, vermisst, so dass mein zweiter Sohn in den Genuss eines S3 gekommen ist und ich mir das Note 2 gekauft habe.In meiner Rezension werde ich nicht auf technische Details eingehen, sondern aus der Perspektive des Nutzers einige Punkte ansprechen, die ich für die Kaufentscheidung des Note 2 für wichtig erachte.Zuerst der Akku:Anders als beim Note 2 hält dieser wirklich lange. Wenn ich abends das Note 2 an das Ladegerät stecke, hat es meistens noch gut 50 % des Akku. Ganz leer war der Akku nach einem Tag bislang noch nie. Natürlich hält die Akkuladung eines Smartphones nicht so lange, wie die eines Handysaus früheren Zeiten, bei dem einmal Aufladen in der Woche reichte. Aber ich finde es völlig in Ordnung, wenn man mit einem geladenen Akku sicher durch den Tag kommt. Praktisch ist auch, dass man den Akku - anders als bei vielen anderen Geräten - selbst austauschen kann. So muss man das Gerät nicht einschicken und spart viel Geld.S-Pen: An den Eingabestift von Samsung habe ich mich so richtig gewöhnt. Ich notiere mir zwischendurch öfter ein paar Sachen in das Programm S-Note. Das Note 2 lässt sich so einstellen, dass sich beim Herausziehen des S-Pen S-Note automatisch öffnet. Man kann dann seine Notiz eingeben, ohne dass man den Bildschirm zuvor entsperren muss. Das ist einfach nur praktisch. Genial finde ich die Möglichkeit, Bildschirminhalte mit dem S-Pen einzukreisen. Diese werden dann automatisch in die Zwischenablage kopiert und man kann sie dann per Messenger oder E-Mail weiter verschicken. Das ist so toll gelöst, dass ich es sehr häufig nutze.MP3-Player:Ich habe zahlreiche MP3-Player verschiedener Marken, die alle sehr teuer waren, aber bei keinem kann man am Gerät Playlisten erstellen und verwalten. Dies ist bei dem vorinstallierten MP3-Player ebenso unkompliziert möglich wie bei der MP3-App von amazon, die ich auf dem Note 2 zumeist nutze. Da ich eine große Musiksammlung habe, finde ich es gut, dass man die 16 GB des Note 2 durch eine Micro-SD-Karte um 64 GB erweitern kann. Zum Joggen ist das Note 2 als MP3-Player natürlich zu groß und schwer, aber da ich mein Note 2 sonst ohnehin immer dabei habe, höre ich zumeist mit ihm Musik (Das scheinen inzwischen offenbar die meisten so zu machen, denn das Angebot an MP3-Playern am Markt hat sich seit einiger Zeit deutlich reduziert).E-Book-Reader:Meine E-Books lese ich in der Regel mit meinem E-Book-Reader von amazon (Kindle Paperwhite), mit dem ich sehr zufrieden bin. Ich habe die Kindle-App auch auf dem Note 2 installiert. Wenn mir unterwegs der Lesestoff ausgeht, kann ich so über das Note 2 sehr einfach bei amazon neue Bücher herunterladen (wegen fehlendem 3G geht das mit dem Kindle Paperwhite nicht, dieser benötigt für das Herunterladen von Büchern eine WLAN-Verbindung). Durch den großen und auflösungsstarken Bildschirm, bei dem sich auch Schriftgröße, Zeilenabstand usw. gut einstellen lassen, liest es sich auch auf dem Note 2 sehr angenehm. So nehme ich bei kleineren Ausflügen meinen E-Book-Reader gar nicht mehr mit. Durch das automatische Synchronisieren über WLAN kann man dann zu Hause auf dem Kindle an der Stelle weiterlesen, an der man die Lektüre mit dem Note 2 unterbrochen hat - einfach nur praktisch! (Falls jemand nur selten E-Books liest, kann er mit dem Note 2 einen separaten E-Book-Reader ersetzen)RuhemodusDa ich das Note 2 auch als Wecker nutze, liegt es abends neben dem Bett. Bei dem Vorgänger fand ich es störend, dass die Leuchtdiode bei eingehenden E-Mails während der Nacht zu Blinken begann. Beim Note 2gibt es eine gute Lösung: Man kann eine Ruhezeit definieren, während der die LED nicht blinkt. Außerdem werden nur Anrufe von zuvor festgelegten Personen akzeptiert. Ich lasse während des Ruhemodus nur Anrufe der von mir definierten Favoriten zu. So können mich wichtige Personen erreichen, sonst habe ich aber meine Ruhe.Samsung KiesFür die Datentransfer zwischen Laptop und Note 2 benötigt man das Samsung-Programm KIES. Mit meinem alten Windows-7-Laptop funktionierte das bislang nur sehr selten (meist ließ sich keine Verbindung zwischen Laptop und Note 2 herstellen), mit dem neuen Samsung Utra-Book, das mit Windows 8 läuft, funktioniert es bislang allerdings ohne Probleme.Größe und GewichtDas Note 2 ist natürlich alles andere als ein Leichtgewicht. In der Hosentasche finde ich es ziemlich störend und auch für die Hemdtasche ist es mir zu schwer. Daher transportiere ich es in meiner Aktentasche oder im Rucksack bzw. in einer Jackentasche.KalenderBesonders häufig verwende ich den vorinstallierten Kalender von Samsung (S-Planner). Durch den großen Bildschirm lässt er sich sehr gut nutzen. Da er sich sehr einfach mit Google synchronisieren lässt, braucht man auch keine Angst vor Datenverlusten zu haben und kann auch von anderen Endgeräten auf seine Daten zugreifen und Termine bearbeiten.KontakteDie Kontakte lassen sich über die vorinstallierte Kontakte-App von Samsung gut verwalten. Man kann Kontakte verschiedenen Gruppen zuordnen und gut personalisieren. So habe ich meinen häufigsten Kontakten eigene Klingeltöne zugewiesen, so dass ich sofort erkenne, wer anruft. Da ich meine ca. 350 Kontakte mit Google synchronisiert habe, waren sie beim Wechsel vom S3 auf das Note 2 auch in Sekundenschnelle automatisch auf dem Gerät (kein Vergleich zu früher, als man beim Kauf eines neuen Handys erst einmal alles neu eintippen musste). Praktisch finde ich auch, dass die Geburtstage, die man in den Kontakten eingibt, im Terminkalender angezeigt werden.KameraDas Note 2 macht bei gutem Licht auch gute Bilder. Daher nehme ich bei kleinen Wanderungen oft gar keinen Fotoapparat mehr mit. Bei schlechtem Licht oder in Räumen werden die Fotos aber oft unscharf und verwackeln leicht. Hier ersetzt das Note 2 dann keine Digitalkamera mehr. Man kann - bei gutem Licht natürlich - mit dem Note 2 auch recht gut filmen. Hier finde ich die Zeitlupen- und die Zeitrafferfunktion recht witzig.E-MailDa der Bildschirm recht groß ist und man auf der virtuellen Tastatur sehr gut tippen kann, schreibe ich viele E-Mails auf dem Note 2. Über eingehende E-Mails wird man durch die blinkende LED informiert (so auch bei SMS und verpassten Anrufen).TelefonierenAch ja - telefonieren soll man mit einem Smartphone natürlich auch können! Das klappt mit dem Note 2 sehr gut - der Klang ist angenehm und frei von Verzerrungen. Wenn die Familie mithören soll, lassen sich Gespräche auch laut stellen - der eingebaute Lautsprecher funktioniert recht gut.FazitNach einem Vierteljahr bin ich von meinem Note 2 noch genau so begeistert wie am Anfang! Es ist ein kleiner Alleskönner, der eine komplette Büroausstattung enthält. Die Nutzung macht einfach nur Spaß und ich kann das Note 2 all denen empfehlen, die sich an seiner Größe und seinem Gewicht nicht stören. Den Preis von 500 Euro finde ich aufgrund der Vielzahl an guten Lösungen völlig in Ordnung. Ich würde es mir sofort wieder kaufen.",2013年5月21日 在德国审核

Positiv überrascht!,"Nachdem ich zuerst ein iPhone 3G S, dann ein 4S, dann ein Note und jetzt das Note 2 in Besitz nehmen durfte, lässt sich für mich folgendes Fazit erkennen: seit dem iPhone 4 hat Apple es nicht geschafft, besondere Neuerungen zu liefern. Samsung jedoch schon. Als ich das erste Galaxy Note in Verwendung nahm, war für mich bereits nach einer Woche klar, dass das iPhone 4S (immer noch teurer als das Note!!!) in allen Belangen nicht mitkam.Ich bestellte mir nun also das Galaxy Note 2 und erwartete kaum Neuerungen, jedoch wurde ich schnell eines besseren belehrt! Das Note 2 läuft schneller, länger, flüssiger und benutzerfreundlicher als sein Vorgänger. Die Größe hatte mich schon beim Original nach 3 Tagen nicht mehr gestört, sondern eher erfreut. Lesen, fernsehen, schreiben und spielen...alles ein Genuss auf dem Note 2. Es kommt einem sogar etwas kleiner vor als der Vorgänger, denn es liegt nun nicht mehr so klumpig in der Hand. es ist haitisch sehr angenehm und nicht mehr wie ein kantiges kleines Brett. Zudem gibt es zahlreiche tolle neue Features, die weder das erste Note, noch irgendein 700€ - iPhone bieten können. Ich kann also nur festhalten, dass ich meinen iPhones nicht nachtrauere und fürs Erste definitiv bei diesem Super-Gerät bleiben werde! Besonders, wenn man bedenkt, dass Konkurrenten wie das Sony Xperia Z, das HTC One und allen voran das iPhone mehr kosten, weniger können und nach einem halben Tag zurück an die Ladestation müssen!",2013年4月7日 在德国审核

Smartlet der Superlative,"Ich kann alles bestätigen! SGS3 -&gt; langweilig. Da wo das S3 noch überlegt bevor es den Befehl ausführt, weiß das Note2 schon lange was ich tun wollte, bevor ich es tue ;) Undglaublich, was der größere Ram ausmacht. Etwas flüssigeres hab ich noch ne erlebt. Ich hab ja beim S2 schon gesagt: ""Das behalte ich für viele Jahre denn es ist verdammt schnell"" aber das Note2 könnte das erste Phone sein, dass ich wirklich länger als 1 Jahr behalte :) Flüssiger als Flüssig ist nunmal nicht möglich. Selbst beim Multitasking. Was will man da noch verbessern? Ich hab letztens im Playstore gesurft während ich bei Facebook gechattet habe und nebenbei lief noch ein Film als Popup (alles dank der Multiwindow-View) und NICHT EIN VERDAMMTER Ruckler. Ich kann es heute noch nicht so ganz begreifen. Achja! Und ich bin wirklich ein Spielsack am Handy und mach und tu was nur geht und dennoch bekomm ich den Akku nicht klein. Wenn ich es an einem Abend lade, muss es am nächsten Abend noch lange nicht an die Steckdose. Trotz dauerhaften WLAN sind es paar Stündchen weniger aber unter einem Tag den Akku leer zu saugen grenzt fast an eine Glanzleistung! Wer das schafft sollte sich dann doch lieber nen Lappi oder PC zulegen denn das schont die Augen weit mehr!Achja! Thema Displaygröße: ""Welche Größe?"" Ich merke nichts. Ich kann nur empfehlen statt einer Menge spuckiger ""TPU Silicon Cases"" oder ähnlichem die folgende Kombination zu wählen wie ich es habe:Samsung Flipcover (Rückseite wird ausgetauscht und sieht fast wie original aus plus Displayschutz. (ca 3mm zuwachs in der Dicke) Auf die Rückseite UND auf den Rahmen kommt die ZAGG Invisible Shield Folie und auf das Display noch ne dünne Displayschutzfolie. Das Handy sieht aus wie neu und ist kaum fetter als vorher. Somit passt es bequem in jede Hosentasche. Nagut! Sagen wir mal lieber Gesäßtasche denn für vorn benötigt man echt verdammt große Hosen ;)Auf den S-Pen geh ich erst gar nicht weiter ein, da er Seinesgleichen sucht.

Gutes Gerät mit kleinen Fehlern,"Nach langem überlegen welches Gerät mein ausgedientes iphone4 ersetzen sollte, habe ich mich für das Note 2 entschieden. Für ein Smartphone ungewöhnlich groß, erfüllt es doch den Zweck für den ich es brauche sehr gut. Ich nutze es häufig um während Zugfahrten zu lesen oder im Bett Videos zu sehen, dafür war mir das iphone zu klein. Ich hatte mir vor dem Note 2 ein Nexus 7 Tablet gekauft um diese Aufgabe für mich zu erfüllen, dieses wurde nun aber völlig vom Note ersetzt. Die Größe des Gerätes stört mich nur selten, da es wirklich dünn ist und so gut in die Hosentasche einer Jeans passt. Mit einer Schutzhülle, die ich mir zugelegt habe,wird leider die einhändige Bedienung sehr erschwert.Was mich wirklich sehr stört ist die Anfälligkeit des Displays für Kratzer. Ich hatte das Gerät zwei tage lang, habe es pfleglich behandelt und hatte es in meiner Hosentasche (ohne andere Gegenstände) als ich einen großen, oberflächlichen Kratzer am Display entdecken musste. Hier ein großes Lob an Amazon: Nach einem kurzen Telefonat wurde das Gerät gegen ein neues ausgetauscht, und das fällt für mich in diesem Fall wirklich unter Kulanz. Zusätzlich habe ich mir dann Display Schutzfolie und ein Flipcase bestellt, um weiteren Kratzern vorzubeugen. Ich sehe es nur nicht ganz ein, wieso ein Display in Zeiten von Gorilla Glass noch so kratzempfindlich sein muss. Auf mein iphone habe ich wesentlich weniger aufgepasst und das hat bis heute noch ein makelloses Display.Ich hatte vor dem Kauf geplant, das Note 2 als Graphiktablett für unterwegs an meinem Laptop zu nutzen. Leider fehlt hier aber noch entsprechende Software. Ich habe zwar ein funktionierendes Softwarepaket gefunden, aber leider ist die Eingabeverzögerung zu groß um wirklich damit zu arbeiten. Alternativen zu der Software gibt es, allerdings können diese keine Druckstufen Daten übergeben, was sie für mich ebenfalls unbrauchbar macht.Ansonsten ist das Note 2 ein sehr gutes Smartphone. Die Akkuleistung ist für ein Smartphone ausgezeichnet, alles läuft schnell und flüssig.Ich kann das Gerät also auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen, auf eine Display Schutzfolie sollte man aber nicht verzichten.",2013年5月7日 在德国审核

Super Smartphone mit kleinen Mängeln,"Ich nutze das Note 2 jetzt seit 30 Tagen und habe schon recht viele Erfahrungen gesammelt also möchte ich jetzt hier mal meine Meinung loswerden.

Klar, man kann es nicht mehr wirklich mit einer Hand bedienen aber das ist ja bei den aktuellen Topsmartphones schon Standart. Und bei der Benutzung ist der riesige Bildschirm einfach nur großartig. In die Hosentasche passt es auch sehr gut. Aber die Größe sollte ja jeder Interessent kennen.Nun zu den Funktionen und der Geschwindigkeit: Es hat viele sehr hilfreiche Funktionen und ist damit meiner Meinung nach die Beste Android Version, die man derzeit findet und dazu noch sehr schnell. Selbst bei aufwendigen Spielen hat man extrem kurze Ladezeiten. Alles in allem ein Super Smartphone mit einem Mängel: Die Verarbeitung der Tasten. Das Gerät an sich ist super verarbeitet und fühlt sich super an doch die Tasten sind schrecklich: Nach etwa zehn Tagen Benutzung hat der On/Off Button gewackelt und nach weiteren zehn Tagen die Lautstärkewippe.Wen weder die schlechte Verarbeitung der Tasten, noch die Größe abschreckt: Klare EmpfehlungAn alle Anderen: Ihr seid Beispielsweise mit einem One X Plus, Lumia 920 oder iPhone 5, je nach Vorliebe, besser Beraten.",2013年1月22日 在德国审核

Super Smartphone,"Nachdem mich mein altes Telefon nur noch aufgeregt hat wegen Funktionsfehlern, habe ich mir das Note 2 bestellt.Ich war positiv überrascht von den Möglichkeiten die man hat, surfen macht richtig Spass, Emails schreiben ist einfach, Programme sind top (Notizen, Präsentationen erstellen usw) und die Kamera ist super. Ich hab im Grunde nicht wirklich Ahnung von Smartphones, wichtig für mich ist eine gute Kamera und eine einfache Bedienung.Nach gut einem halben Jahr Nutzung muss ich aber sagen, dass mich die Größe mittlerweile schon etwas stört. Ich (als Frau) habe relativ große Hände und mir fällt es manchmal schon fast aus der Hand, speziell wenn man einhändig eine Nachricht mit dem Daumen schreibt =( Die Analyse meines Nutzverhaltens zeigt auch, dass ich es eig nicht brauche. Jeder der sich denkt, ""oh cool das hat ja einen Stift"" der sollte sich genau überlegen, ob er den braucht. Ich hab ihn vlt. 3 mal benutzt.Positiv ist dank der Größe natürlich der Screen. Mit diesem Smartphone lässt sich auch in der Vorlesung relativ gut Internet-Recherche betreiben =) Das ist ein großer Pluspunkt. D.h. ich muss mein Notebook nicht mitschleifen ;)Filme schauen macht Spaß, Musik hören eher weniger, der der große Screen unhandlich ist. Da ist ein handelsüblicher MP3-Player schon was feines.Wer ein gutes (großes) Smartphone zum Arbeiten, Emails schreiben oder eben berfulich braucht, ist damit gut beraten. Für mich als ottonormal Verbraucher würde aber auch ein kleineres Model reichen.Negativpunkt ist die Größe der Tasten. Da hat man schon einen rießen Screen und die Buchstaben sind in mini-Format.

Tolles kein 5 Sterne Handy,"Damit ich nicht falsch verstanden werde, ich hab mich verliebt – ins Note 2.Und bin etwas traurig, weil es noch schöner hätte sein können. Die ganze Funktionalität ist ja oft genug beschrieben worden, Größe auch usw. Aber die Verarbeitung! Dazu muss ich erstmal sagen, die Geräte sind unterschiedlich, je nachdem wie man Glück hat. Wenn einer schreibt, sein Display ist zudunkel oder stichig, dann stimmt das auch. Wenn ein anderer schreibt, sein Display ist toll, dann ist das so und er hat Glück gehabt. Also kann ich nur über mein Gerät berichten. Die Helligkeit ist so gut, dass ich sie nur auf ¼ gestellt habe. Ich hatte im MediaMarkt eins in der Hand, da war die Helligkeit voll aufgedreht und es war immer noch dunkler als mein ¼. Die Frontkamera hat in der Mitte einen hellroten Spot, Selbstfotos haben roten Kopf und weißgrünen Hals. Die Hauptkamera ist in Ordnung, die Bilder reißen einen insgesamt nicht vom Hocker, aber brauchbar. Videos ebenso, zufriedenstellend, nicht so toll wie manche hier beschreiben. Die Ein-AusTaste wackelt, die Lautstärkewippe Gott sei Dank nicht. Beide sind ständig im Weg und man kommt dauernd aus Versehen dran.

Samsung Galaxy Note II - DAS Smartphone!,"Nachdem ich bereits den Vorgänger dieses Smartphones das Samsung Galaxy Note I (GT-N7000) besaß, entschloss ich mich, es durch das Note II zu ersetzen. Das Note der ersten Generation löste bei mir schon Begeisterung aus - super großer HD Super AMOLED Bildschirm mit 16 Mio. Farben, flüssige Bedienung durch unkomplizierte Menuführung und starkem 1,4 GHz Dual-Core Prozessor, einem leistungsstarken Akku und natürlich dem S-Pen, den man einfach nur zum Notizen machen oder aber auch zum kreativ sein und z.B. kommentieren von Fotos nutzen kann. Soviel zum Note I. Das Note II legt bei fast allem noch einmal nach: Allein schon die Optik ist super. Ich bestellte mir das Gerät in ""titanium-grau"", was unglaublich edel aussieht. Natürlich ist die Oberfläche kein Aluminium o. ä. doch der Metall-Look macht ordentlich was her. Im Vergleich zum Note I ist die Rückseite des Geräts nun glatt. Manche mögen dies als Nachteil sehen, da das Gerät möglicherweise leichter aus der Hand rutschen könnte, doch ich finde eine glatte Oberfläche optisch schöner.Das Note II hat einen 1,6 GHz Quad-core Prozessor und einen im Vergleich zum Note I doppelt so großen Arbeitsspeicher von 2 GB RAM an Bord. Das Display ist etwas schmaler aber dafür höher als beim Note I.Der S-Pen wurde deutlich verbessert und ist nun präzieser. Dank Air-View sieht man ab einer Entfernung mit dem Pen zum Display ab ca. 1 cm einen kleinen Kreis, der die Stelle markiert, über der sich der Pen gerade befindet und an der man zum Schreiben ansetzen würde. Positioniert man diesen Kreis in der Galerie über einem Album, wird eine Mini-Ansicht geöffnet und man hat einen Überblick, was sich alles in dem Album befindet. Ähnlich ist es mit Videos. Bewegt man den blauen kreis über ein Video, wird es in einem kleinen Fenster geöffnet und ein Ausschnitt davon (natürlich mit Sound) abgespielt (das alles wohlgemerkt, ohne dass der S-Pen das Display berührt). Diese ""Vorschau-Funktion"" finde ich sehr gelungen.Eine weitere neue Funktion ist der ""S-Pen Keeper"". Ist dieser aktiviert und man geht mit dem Gerät in der Hand, ohne dass der Pen eingesteckt ist, wird nach kurzer Zeit ein Alarm ausgelöst, der einen daran erinnert, dass der S-Pen nicht eingesteckt ist. Damit soll verhindert werden, dass man ihn irgendwo vergisst. Eine super Idee.Neu dazu gekommen ist auch die Funktion ""Schneller Blick"". Ist diese aktiviert, muss man bei ausgeschaltetem Display zwei oder mehr Finger langsam knapp über die Sensoren des Note II oben rechts bewegen, dann wird das Display kurz eingeschaltet und Informationen über verpasste Anrufe/Nachrichten, Akkuzustand usw. angezeigt. Nach einigen Sekunden geht das Display dann wieder aus. Welche Informationen angezeigt werden, lässt sich individuell einstellen. Damit diese Funktion auch im Dunkeln genutzt werden kann, werden die Sensoren bei Dunkelheit schwach rot beleuchtet, damit man sie findet.Dank dem Quad-core Prozessor und 2 GB Arbeitsspeicher läuft das Note II absolut flüssig. Hänger konnte ich bisher kaum feststellen und wenn waren diese absolut minimal. Dem leistungsfähigeren Akku (Note I 2500 mAh, Note II 3100 mAh) ist es zu verdanken, dass das Gerät für ein Smartphone dieser Größe und mit einem immensen Funktionsumfang sehr lange durchhält. Nachdem ich den Akku das erste mal voll aufgeladen hatte, dauerte es 1 Tag und knapp 20 Stunden, bis ich mich entschloss den Akku wieder zu laden, da er nur noch 18% Kapazität aufwies. Dementsprechend habe ich einen super ersten Eindruck von der Akkuleistung erhalten. Nachdem das Gerät an das Ladegerät angeschlossen wurde, vergingen nur ca. 2 Stunden und der Akku war wieder bei 100%. Das ist sicherlich auch dem neuen Netzstecker zu verdanken, der einen im Vergleich zum Ladegerät des Note I größeren Stromoutput hat (Note I 1.0A, Note II 2.0A). Daher dauert das Laden selbst bei größerer Akkukapazität nicht länger als beim Vorgänger.Das Note II hat im Vergleich zum Vorgänger ein etwas weniger hochauflösendes Display (1.280 x 720 Pixel, Note I 1.280 x 800 Pixel), doch das ist überhaupt nicht schlimm. Das Display wirkt schärfer und die Farben brillianter als noch beim Vorgänger. Dass das Display nun ein Format von 16:9 hat, ist für das anschauen von Filmen sehr vorteilhaft.Bei dem Glas, dass das Display schützt handelt es sich um ""Gorilla Glass 2"". Gorilla Glass ist besonders bruch- und kratzfest (etwa zwei bis drei mal kratzfester als herkömmliches Glas) und eignet sich damit ideal für Smartphones, Tablets usw. Das erste Gorilla Glas im Smartphonebereich wurde beim ersten iPhone verbaut. Beim Note II wurde die Weiterentwicklung Gorilla Glass 2 verwendet. Das Display ist so hervorragend geschützt und es braucht schon einiges, um ihm Kratzer hinzuzufügen. In Youtube Videos ist zu sehen, wie Geräte mit Gorilla Glass mit Messern und Schlüsseln ""bearbeitet"" werden, doch selbst das scheint keine Kratzer zu verursachen.Natürlich gibt es noch viele weitere Verbesserungen: Der Lautsprecher ist um einiges lauter geworden, hört sich aber selbst bei voller Lautstärke nicht ""blechern"" an.Dann wäre da noch die Kamera. Sie hat sich bezüglich der Auflösung nicht verändert. Genau wie beim Note I hat sie 8 MP und liefert für eine ""Handykamera"" erstaunlich gute Fotos, die ""knackscharf"" werden. Ebenso verhält es sich mit Videos. Es können Videos in Full HD Qualität also mit 1.920 x 1.080 Pixel aufgenommen werden und diese können sich wirklich sehen lassen. Selbst auf einem (Full HD) Fernseher betrachtet sind die Videos noch absolut scharf. Das alles bezieht sich jedoch nur auf Fotos/Videos bei denen nicht gezoomt wird. Nutzt man den digitalen Zoom, verlieren die Bilder/Videos schnell an Qualität und schärfe, aber das düfte bei Handykameras normal sein.Die Kamera löst nun deutlich schneller aus. Auch sind praktische neue Funktionen wie die Serienaufnahme hinzugekommen. Um eine solche auszulösen, hält man die Auslösetaste einfach gedrückt und kann so innerhalb kurzer Zeit bis zu 20 Fotos hintereinander schießen.Das Gerät kommt mit Android Jellybean 4.1.1. Da ich vor kurzem bereits beim Note I ein Update von ICS 4.0.4 auf Jellybean 4.1.2 durchführen konnte, nahm ich an, dass die neueste Version für das Note II ebenso zur Verfügung stehen sollte, was dann auch der Fall war. Über W-LAN lud ich die verfügbaren Updates herunter, sodass das Gerät nun auf dem neusten Stand 4.1.2 ist.Damit das Note II stets im Bilde ist, wie es z.B. Bilder anzeigen oder drehen soll, das Display heller oder dunkler gedimmt werden soll usw. verfügt es über insgesamt 11 Sensoren, darunter Beschleunigungssensor, Magnetfeldsensor, Gyroskopsensor, Schwerkraftsensor, Lichtsensor, Annäherungssensor und noch einige mehr.Eine kleine aber sehr nützliche Neuerung ist die Benachrichtigungs-LED oben links neben dem Lautsprecher. Leuchtet sie nicht, ist sie kaum und nur bei genauem hinsehen zu erkennen. Vor dem Note I hatte ich ein Smartphone, dass über eine Benachrichtigungs-LED verfügte und vermisste sie dementsprechend beim Note. Wenn man es gewohnt ist, nur durch einen kurzen Blick auf die LED zu erkennen, ob es verpasste Anrufe o. ä. gibt, ist es schon lästig, den Bildschirm immer kurz einschalten zu müssen, um diese Information zu erhalten. Zudem dürfte die Benachrichtigungs-LED dem Akkuverbrauch gut tun, da sie weniger Energie verbrauchen dürfte, als wenn man X mal den Bildschirm ein und wieder ausschaltet.Per App kann man die Benachrichtigungs-LED konfigurieren und einstellen, dass sie z. B. bei verpassten Anrufen rot, bei SMS blau, bei MMS Gelb, bei E-Mails grün usw. blinken soll. Standartmäßig leuchtet die LED beim Aufladen des Note II rot, welchselt zu grün, wenn das Gerät aufgeladen ist und blinkt bei verpassten Anrufen/SMS/MMS usw. blau. Passend zum Symbol des WhatApp Messenger blinkt die LED bei mir bei neuen WhatsApp Nachrichten grün (die Farbe lässt sich in den WhatsApp Einstellungen auswählen).Man merkt deutlich, dass mehr und mehr darauf geachtet wird, Energie zu sparen. Zum einen verbrauchen die beim HD Super AMOLED eingesetzen LED's deutlich weniger Strom als ein LCD Bildschirm, zum anderen wird beim Note II selbst die Helligkeit der kleinen Benachrichtigungs-LED vom Lichtsensor mitgesteuert. Befindet sich das Gerät beim Laden in einer dunklen Umgebung, leuchtet die LED nur schwach rot. Ist es rundherum hell, ist die LED auch deutlich heller. Bei verpassten Nachrichten usw. blinkt die LED meines erachtens nach immer in voller Stärke.Bei allem Lob muss ich jedoch auch eine Sache erwähnen, die meine Begeisterung schon kurz nach dem auspacken etwas bremste. Ich nahm den Akkudeckel ab und wollte meine Sim-Karte einlegen. Zu meiner großen Überraschung passte diese jedoch nicht in den SIM Karten Slot. Kurze Zeit später war klar warum. Ich besitze eine mittlerweile 5 Jahre alte SIM Karte, die noch die ""alte"" Größe hat. Das Note II jedoch verdaut nur die kleinere neuere Version, die sich Micro SIM nennt. Leider wird weder hier auf der Amazon Produktseite noch auf der Produktseite bei Samsung darauf hingewiesen, dass hier Micro SIM gebraucht wird. Nach kurzer Internetrecherche fand ich heraus, dass es die Möglichkeit gibt, sich eine zu große Karte selbst auf Micro SIM Größe zurecht zu schneiden oder aber zu einem Händler zu gehen und sie sich einfach ausstanzen zu lassen. Natürlich immer mit dem Risiko, dass der Chip beschädigt und die Karte somit unbrauchbar wird. Da ich das Note jedoch voll nutzen wollte entschied ich mich für Möglichkeit zwei und ließ mir die Karte zurechtstanzen, was zum Glück gelang. Trotzdem habe ich bei meinem Mobilfunkanbieter eine Ersatz SIM Karte mit Micro Maßen geordert, die ich freundlicherweise sogar umsonst geschickt bekomme.Alles in allem bin ich bisher absolut zufrieden mit dem Note II. Bereits das Note I war super, doch das Note II legt bei fast allem noch einmal eine ""Schippe drauf"" und ist somit für mich das momentan beste Smartphone auf dem Markt.----------------------------Zwischenbericht, 10.03.2014----------------------------Es ist nun auf den Tag genau ein Jahr her, dass ich die obige Rezension verfasste und ich möchte kurz beschreiben, wie sich das Note II im ersten Jahr geschlagen hat.Zunächst, die Begeisterung wurde nicht gedämpft, es gab keine Defekte oder Mängel. Das Gerät läuft nach wie vor recht flott, auch wenn mir aufgefallen ist, dass es jetzt doch von Zeit zu Zeit ein wenig ruckelt und z. B. das öffnen von Programmen ein wenig länger dauert als anfangs. Wer jetzt denkt, ganz klar, wenn man das Gerät bis zum Anschlag mit Apps vollpackt ist das kein Wunder, darauf kann ich nur sagen, dass nur das nötigste an Apps installiert wurde. Dazu gehören für mich z. B. ein Anti-Viren-Programm, die App meines E-Mail Dienstes usw. Abgesehen von der etwas ausgebremsten Performance konnte ich nichts negatives feststellen. Es macht nach wie vor Spaß das Note II zu benutzen. Allein schon der 5.5"" HD Super AMOLED Bildschirm ist ein Fest für die Augen. Gestochen scharf, nach wie vor kräftige, fast schon ""knallige"" Farben und wenn nötig auch ordentlich hell.Ebenso bin ich nach wie vor von der Kamera recht begeistert. Im Vergleich zum Note löst sie wesentlich schneller aus und Ihre Features, egal ob ""bestes Gesicht"" oder die enthaltenen Effekte sind grandios. Mit ihren 8 MP macht sie für eine Handykamera erstaunlich gute Bilder.Auffällig ist, dass nach dem letzten Update, der Arbeitsspeicher nun deutlich mehr ausgelastet ist als davor. Nach oben ist aber immer noch genug Luft, sodass es in der hinsicht nicht eng wird.Der Akku hält - trotz seit Inbetriebnahme annähernd täglichem laden - meiner Ansicht nach im Großen und Ganzen noch so gut/lange wie anfangs, super.Mein Fazit nach einem Jahr: Das Note II ist weiterhin absolut empfehlenswert.",2013年3月10日 在德国审核

Hätte mehr erwartet...,"Hallo Amazon - Gemeinde,Im vorfeld möchte ich mich für rechtschreibfehler oder sonstiges entschuldigen. Ich möchte hier nur meine Meinung zu dem Gerät äußern. Das Gerät befindet sich seit November im Besitz.Der Grund warum ich mich für das Gerät entschieden habe war in erster Linie das große Display... zudem habe ich mich von dem aktuellen hype von Samsung beeinflussen lassen den ich überhaupt nicht nachvollziehen kann.Erstmal im vorfeld.. zuvor hatte ich ein HTC desire HD welches ja einige Akku Probleme hatte.Als ich die packung vom note 2 öffnete war ich erst positiv überrascht. als ich das gerät jedoch in die hand genommen habe, musste ich feststellen das Gerät abzulut billig wirkt... naja egal ich dachte pack das teil eh in einer silikonhülle dann merkte ich davon nichts...Naja eingeschaltet und eingerichtet und ein wenig dran rumgespielt... Hier fasse ich nun positive und Neutrale Aspekte und negative Aspekte zusammen...: + Großes scharfes Display + Internet surfen sehr schnell, mobilfunk und Wlan + S-Pen bietet echt nette features + trotz der größe noch handlich (für große Hände) + Super Akku (hält locker ein tag durch trotz intensivnutzung) + Guter empfang von gsm umts GPS wlan usw. . Klangqualität ist in ordnung jedoch nicht überzeugend ( bei anrufen) . Kamera ist ok, die vom htc desire hd fand ich besser! - Plastik gehäuse wirkt total billig - Alles knartzt an verschieden ecken und kanten - Gehäuse sehr empfindlich für Kratzer - So viele Programm abstütze von Apps und Touch wizz selbst sind nervig. von update zu update immer schlechter - Tasten Wackeln und knacken - Akkudeckel lösst sich zum teil von und muss erst wieder befestig werden - wake up dauert so seine zeit.. manchmal dauert es 2 sec bis das display bedienbar ist.. - bei der menü taste das selbe, drückt man sie, schließt sich das program 1 - 2 sec später - ohne silikonhülle ist das smartphone sehr rutschiig und fühlt sich wie ein billig telefon an - Software bleibt sehr oft hängen - manche wischgesten (anruf annehmen, wcker ausschalten) muss man 100%ig gerade durchführen ansonsten wird es nicht erkannt.. - ansich im telefonbuch wird oft geändert, kontakte werden doppelt angezeig, dann mal nur alle Fb kontakte oder sim kontakte - Gallery sehr un- übersichtich - Touch wiz ist nicht mein ding, htc sense gefiel mir besser, aber das ist geschmacksache - Tastatur totaler dreck, t9 wällt nicht automatisch die wörter aus die es sein können sondern muss draufklicken - In der Taskleiste wird ständig unverständlicher weise der mediaplayer angezeig auch wenn er nicht im gebrauch ist.. auch wenn er beendet wird. - Samsung konton gehen mir auf den sack das sitzungen abgelaufen sind was zwei bis 3 mal am tag erscheint und mich imer anmelden muss! - beim scrollen durch den homescreen und hauptmenü hackt es ständig was bei einem quadcore CPU nicht passieren sollteNach diesen Smartphone weis ich das ich lieber bei htc hätte bleiben sollen.. da nehm ich liebe ein handy mit kleinerem display aber habe da eine software die mir besser gefällt und hoffe das heutzutage nicht so viele programmabstürze dabei sind..Für 500 euro ist das smartphone zu teuer, es fühlt sich gerade mal wie ein 250 euro handy an.. wenn überhaupt.. NIE WIEDER SAMSUNG. Für mich war es das. muss jeder selber wissen. werde das note 2 wiede rzurückschicken da der sd kartenslot kaputt ist und gps nicht mehr funktioniert. hoffe das ich geld bekomme weil das handy mir nicht gefällt.****************UPDATE*************29.11.13***********************Es ist gut ein Jahr vergangen. Hatte mein note wegen Fehler in der Software und Ladefehler und sonstige hardware fehler 3 mal in der Reparatur. Ständig hing sich die Software auf, stürtze ab oder es Ruckelte dermaßen das ich nicht richtig tippen konnte. Mich hatte das Gerät echt nerven gekostet, und bin froh das Amazon es nun zurücknimmt.

Samsung Galaxy Note 2,"Ich hatte mich vor kurzem Entschlossen ein Smartphone zu kaufen. Ich wollte auf jeden Fall ein aktuelles haben mit genügend Leistung (Quadcore war da für mich Pflicht). Als erstes hatte ich das Google Nexus 4 ins Auge gefasst, denn man kriegt dort schon einiges für sein Geld. Ich konnte mich jedoch nicht mir den ""nur"" 16GB internen Speicher anfreunden, denn microSD Karten o.ä. kann man mit dem Nexus 4 nicht nutzen. Auch der Akku hält nicht so lange wie beim Note 2. Ein weiteres contra Argument war der Display. Beim Nexus 4 hat man eine enorm hohe Pixeldichte (ppi), dafür ist das Display an sich bei weitem nicht so Kontrastreich wie ein AMOLED HD Display. Da ich bei einem Freund vor einiger Zeit ein AMOLED Display gesehen habe, war für mich recht schnell klar, dass diese Punkte den Aufpreis von 150 Euro Wert sind. Zudem gibt hier das Gerät von Amazon direkt. Jeder weiß, dass wenn irgendwann man ein Problem mit einem Produkt sein sollte, welches bei Amazon direkt gekauft wurde, der Support Weltklasse ist.Nun habe ich seit einigen Tagen das Note 2 im Einsatz und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht. Das Display ist super, der Akku hält enorm lange (Einen Tag, wenn man es wirklich SEHR intensiv nutzt, ansonsten Zwei), der Akku wird mit 2A geladen, was im Endeffekt heißt, dass das Handy nach 1,5 Stunden der Akku komplett geladen wird (wenn er bei 0% war), das ist schon fix bei der Kapazität.Android ist ein super Betriebssystem, vor allem für Leute die gerne selbst alles ändern wollen. Mit einem Root wird das ganze dann zum Traum, man kann alles machen und es sind dem User keine Grenzen mehr gesetzt.Die Größe empfinde ich jetzt schon als ein muss, kleiner ist für mich keine Option mehr. In die Hosentasche passt es, ich komme mit meinem Daumen überall hin (große Hände!) und es macht viel emhr Spaß darauf zu Spielen/Videos zu schauen oder zu surfen.Der S-Pen nimmt einem das Tippen ab, wenn man mal keine Lust drauf hat, einfach drauflos schreiben und das Smartphone erkennt nahezu alles, egal wie unordentlich man schreibt.Von den Leistungsdaten ist man hier sehr weit oben, in Benchmarks gewinnt der CPU gegen jeden anderen auf dem Markt, soweit ich das gesehen habe, die GPU ist Top, 2 GB Ram sind auch aktuell, also man kriegt hier für viel Geld viel Highend Smartphone!",2012年12月30日 在德国审核

Wow,"Ich hatte schon einige Smartphones, begonnen mit Pocket PCs, Windows Mobile, Palm, Nokia und bin dann bei Android gelandet und mit dem Betriebssystem und den Möglichkeiten in Kombination mit den Google Services sehr zufrieden.Nach dem Galaxy S und dem Galaxy S+ habe ich mir das Note 2 aufgrund des großen Bildschirms, des Stifts und der hohen Performance des Gerätes genommen und bin sehr begeistert davon.Nach ca. 2 Wochen Verwendung kann ich sagen:- Top Verarbeitung- super Bildschirm- sehr schnell- den Stift verwende ich weniger als erwartet, aber manchmal ist er sehr praktisch- sehr gute Tonqualität bei der Wiedergabe- ausgezeichnete Tonqualität bei Aufnahmen. Ich war überrascht wie gut das Gerät aufnimmt zB in Kombination mit ASR mp3 Sound Recorder- verhältnismäßig sehr gute Kamera mit guter Foto und Video Funktionalität, zB. Serienaufnahmen- etwas groß (na klar, wegen den großen Bildschirm habe ich es ja gekauft) und schwer und daher anfangs gewöhnungsbedürftig. Da ich fast immer mit Sakko oder Tasche unterwegs bin und ein Bluetooth Headset verwende habe ich damit keine Probleme.Allerdings sollte man sich das anfangs genau überlegen, bzw. testen, ob man mit der Größe gut umgehen kann.Für mich ist es das perfekte Smartphone!Ergänzung nach über einem halben Jahr Einsatz:- Bin noch immer begeistert von dem Gerät obwohl ich in der Praxis ein paar Einwände habe- Den Stift verwende ich kaum. Als nächstes Gerät werde ich auf die Stiftbedienung verzichten.- Es ist ein klein wenig zu groß. Die Einhandbedienung ist nicht immer problemlos möglich und es passt meist nicht in die Hemdtaschen. Die Größe vom Galaxy s3 ist wahrscheinlich optimal.- Die Akkulaufzeit ist gut, aber noch verbesserungswürdig. Ein Tag geht sich meist knapp aus ohne Aufladen.- ich verwende eine private und beruflich verwendete SIM Karte in 2 Geräten. Ich leite die meiste Zeit die privaten Anrufe und SMS an das Firmengerät weiter. Idealerweise würde ich das nächste mal ein Dual SIM Gerät kaufen.- Die Geschwindigkeit, der Bildschirm, der Sound sind sehr gut.Derzeit gibt es für mich keinen akuten Grund zum Wechseln und ich werde das Gerät sicher noch einige Zeit im Einsatz haben.Falls es kaputt wird oder verloren geht, werde ich aber aus oben genannten Gründen die dann aktuellen Geräte nochmals neu evaluieren.",2013年4月6日 在德国审核

Ein tolles Gerät!!!,"Was soll ich zu diesem Gerät noch Weiteres sagen? Es ist fantastisch was Samsung da zusammengebaut hat. Seit nun knapp 3 Wochen im Einsatz hat sich das Note II schon heute in meinem Alltag bewährt.Die wichtigsten Daten haben ja schon viele andere zusammengefasst, daher werde ich mich diesbezüglich eher knapp halten.Fakt ist:+ Der 1,6GHz Prozessor, der im Note II verbaut wurde, reicht für die allmeißten Standard Anwendungen locker aus. Bis jetzt kam es insgesamt nur zwei Mal vor, dass das Gerät minimal geruckelt hat. Sonst jedoch läuft jede Anwendung flüssig und tut, was sie tun soll.+ Die Displaygröße ist Gold wert! Das nervige Rein und Rauszoomen, was ich davor vom I-Phone und anderer Smartphones meiner Freunde kannte wird einem bei diesem Gerät auf jeden Fall erspart. Wer nicht die allerkleinsten Händchen hat, wird dieses Gerät gut halten können. Ich zumindest würde nie mehr den Schritt zurück zum Smartphone gehen, wenn man bedenkt, dass es sich beim Note II um ein Phablet handelt :)+ Hosentaschentauglichkeit: Ja, das war auch bei mir ein Punkt wo ich lange überlegt hatte, ob ich mir dieses Gerät kaufen soll, da es wirklich groß ist. Legt man ein I-Phone S4 daneben oder direkt aufs Note II, kommt einem das I-Phone wie ein schlechter Witz vor ;) Es ist wirklich viel größer als ein normales Smartphone. Trotzdem gab es bis heute bei mir keine Situation wo mich die Größe gestört hätte. Es passt bis heute in jede Tasche von jeder Hose, die ich so im Schrank habe!+ Akkuleistung: Das war einer der Hauptgründe für mich, mich beim Kauf eines neuen Handys für das Note II zu entscheiden. Der Akku mit seinen 3100mAh hat ordentliche Leistung. Nach Erfahrung hatte er an jedem Abend des Tages bei wirklich intensiver Benutzung (WLAN und GPS sowie Mobile Daten eingeschaltet+Spiele spielen+KEIN aktivierter Energiesparmodus) noch gut 15% Akku übrig.Außerdem lässt sich der Akku austauschen. Wer lieber ein geschlossenes System (LG Nexus 5) haben möchte, ist dann beim Note II vielleicht nicht so gut aufgehoben. Aber wen das nicht weiters stört (da auch die Gehäuseverarbeitung trotz Plastik 1A ist) sollte sich schon überlegen, nicht einmal mit dem Note II zu liebäugeln.PS: Der Akku ist innerhalb von 1 3/4 Stunden komplett wieder aufgeladen!- Vorsicht gilt allerdings beim Firmware Update!...Man bekommt leider nicht wie beim Nexus 5 die aktuelle Firmware (Android 4.4.2 KitKat) direkt angeliefert. Stattdessen muss man hoffen, mit dem schönen Update dann bedacht zu werden. Wer auf die aktuelle Android Version Wert legt sollte lieber im Bereich der Google Handys stöbern.FAZIT: Trotz der Sache mit dem bis jetzt ausbleibenden Firmware Update (es sieht aber ganz gut aus :) ) war das Note II bis heute sicher kein Fehlkauf. Ich empfehle es jedem sofort weiter, dem Alltagstauglichkeit wichtig sind und der auf höchst anspruchsvolle Grafikspiele verzichten kann, der einen leistungsstarken Akku haben will, wie er sonst nirgendwo zu finden ist und der ein knackscharfes Display vor Augen haben will, dass groß genug ist, um auch HD Filme in beeindruckender Qualität wiederzugeben. Ich würde mein Note II nicht mehr hergeben und gebe dem Produkt daher 5 Sterne!",2014年4月7日 在德国审核

Tolles Smartphone mit schwächer Kamera,"Meine letzten Smartphone waren das Galaxie S,2 sowie das S3, mit allen War ich sehr zufrieden, aber ich wollte einmal eines mit größerem Bildschirm versuchen, daher kam ich zum Note.Ich habe das Note 2 nun seit 3 Monaten im Einsatz und kann es empfehlen, die Stiftfunktionen sind genial und ich möchte sie mittlerweile nicht mehr missen.Das Display hat mehr als 5,5 Zoll, eingängigen Bedienen fällt daher relativ schwer, unter den Einstellungen kann sie zumindest bei Tastatur und Telefon vereinfacht werden.Ein Manko im Vergleich mit dem S3 ist die Displayauflösung,sie ist zwar gleich, aber bei größeren Display merkt man doch eineUnterschied.Die Kamera finde ich sehr schwach, wenn ich sie mit den direkten Konkurrenten vergleiche schneidet sie nicht gut ab.Ein Punkt der klar für das Note spricht ist der Akku, ich benutze meines sehr viel, dennoch habe ich Abends meist noch rund d 40% Akku, das hat bisher noch keines meiner Smartphones geschafft.Internet, NFC und Bluetooth funktionieren ordnungsgemäß.Die Funktionen wie beispielsweise Smart Star sind allerdings bei weitem nicht ausgereift, das sind sie auch beim S4 noch nicht, wirklich benutzbar sind sie meiner Meinungsmache nicht.Ich hoffe ichkonnte einen kurzen Überblick über die fürmich wichtigsten Punkte geben.",2013年6月15日 在德国审核

ONCE YOU GO BLACK(berry) YOU'LL NEVER GO BACK!!!,"I LOVE THIS PHONE!!! I will NEVER go back to android or ios. NEVER! Blackberry is very secure, you don't have to worry about virus or anything like that (maybe, only if you sideload android apps) but the gestures are awesome and make sense, the BB HUB is the best part!!! I can check every tweet, fb msg, email, BBM msg, or any other notification in 1 center, AND not only see it, reply, delete, forward, etc from that same hub, you won't have to open individual apps to do these functions. This phone makes sense. Very efficient! Apps open/funtcion/close properly and timely, NO lag, No hiccup. I know at the time of this review there are other newer models out but this phone is INCREDIBLE.. microHDMI, which I love for when i'm playing TunnelX on the phone, throw it up on the big screen and it's super clear//sound is great//You can check my purchases for the HDMI cable that I bought, if you'd like. Camera is awesome, TimeShift mode is awesome!!! Takes multiple pictures at one time, if someones eyes are closed or made a crazy looking face, you can slide that picture in time to where the person's eyes were open and face no so hideous..lol and save that particular frame. This phone is SO badass, everyone ask me to take pics on my phone etc etc, they dig the picture lock screen. Get this phone, you will be happy! comes with 16Gb of internal memory!!! So any other Sd card you add to it makes it all the better, but unlike most phones, there is NO need for a sd card up front. Like I said, if this phone was nothing to brag about, I wouldn't. I promise not to steer you wrong! This is it! I will be reviewing the Z30 when the price comes down. ONCE YOU GO BLACK(berry) YOU'LL NEVER GO BACK!!!Revision:: All of the above is still true and still awesome. I just had to say that the virtual keyboard is SO on point and SO righteous. I have big fingers, period! I can type as fast as I want, especially using the swipe up feature (hints words displayed above keys, and if that's the word you were doing to type, just slide your finger up over the word and you saved a few seconds of your life trying to type out the word Righteous. lol. You can add words so, if you frequently use the word, or phrase ""What's the deally y0?"""" you can set it up to enter it for you by just typeing 'wdy' on your keyboard, I mean blackberry isn't playing!!! They almost fell off, but they are back with a vengence! Most corporations that dropped BB, are now bringing them back! The security of your device is A1, blackberry is where it's at. So i don't give a hoot about android version 4.987987938278329 kitkat, m&amp;m or whatever ios version there is. THEY CAN'T TOUCH blackberry 10, PERIOD.if you feel this was helpful or at the least entertaining, please hit 'helpful' below! Thanks.",2014年7月25日 在美国审核
Love it.,"I love the phone and I love the Tmobile service.I like that it has a user replaceable battery (the new Z30 doesn't).I already ordered a larger battery through Amazon that other users have recommended ( Amazon product #B00DRS9X8W ).Awesome reception.I've already side loaded most of my Android apps that you can't find on Blackberry World (can't wait until 10.2.1 OS comes out so I don't have to go through 3rd party apps to do this).Only had it for a couple of weeks, so if anything bad happens in the coming months, I'll update accordingly.Update 12-1-13Forgot to add that this phone can do both 4G and 4GLTE and is capable of Hi-Def cell phone calls, if the person on the other end also has Hi-Def.(I read that the data streams on normal voice calls are lower than lan lines, which is really archaic given the data speeds phones are capable of now).Also capable of doing Wi-Fi calling, which is free with T-Mobile and doesn't use minutes.Awesome...except T-Mobile only offers unlimited minutes now, oh well.This has made reception especially better in my home since cell phone signal is poor.Now my phone calls go through my cable internet.Bad news...I'm stuck with Comcast awhile longer, sigh.",2013年11月29日 在美国审核
Wonderful Buying Experience,"About the purchase: Much like everyone else, I was very skeptical about buying a phone on Amazon, but I was also desperate so I did. One week later, to my relief, it arrived and everything was perfect. Everything arrived in-tact and as shown. I definitely do trust this Seller and would make a purchase here again.About the phone: I'm a huge BlackBerry fan but regardless, BlackBerry has done a fantastic job with the Z10. BlackBerry 10 overall is awesome. I've had Apple, Android and BlackBerry phones; I love the difference in the OS. Two of my favorite aspects are: the ease of navigation and BB Hub. At the suggestion of a friend, I took a chance buying this phone; there have been no regrets since. I love the sleek look and design; it's not heavy nor bulky. I would recommend that anyone take a chance on this phone; however if you're a huge apps person, maybe not.",2014年7月17日 在美国审核
The phone the NSA hates,"It's the only smartphone manufacturer that doesn't perform public acts of obscenity on the NSA. Consequently, it's also the only phone certified to run on DoD networks. It has automatic VPN connect, which is something no other phone has. It has an awesome hub/notification feature as well as the peak feature. I love the LED that tells you when a new message or email comes in.There's two weaknesses, the apps and the volume button inadvertently gets pressed, usually down, while in your pocket. The apps problem is partially eliminated if you install Snap. But of course Apple has the best apps. For non-serious stuff, I use my iPad 3. For everyday phone and business use, I'd never go back to an iPhone. Too many damn annoyances that *STILL* exist in the operating system that are vestiges of the original IOS 1.0, like the lack of multitasking, native flashlight app, downloading of files other than pictures, and VPN autoconnect.",2014年4月26日 在美国审核
I Love,"The phone is super lightweight, aesthetically very nice. At first you do not adapt once that is fully touch, however other phones have 3 buttons on the front to help you glide through the functions. This phone is completely touch, but when you start using you adapt quickly. It is very fast, I live in Venezuela and the model I buy grab 3G. You have to look at the model before buying, to grip with your operator 3G. (This phone comes in 4 or 5 identical models but with different bands) should buy the model indicated that the band brings 3G working with your carrier, this information is obtained via the Internet). It has many functions and the camera is super nitida, it looks great. I'm really pleased with my purchase!",2013年11月8日 在美国审核
"great phone, needs apps though","The Z10 is an easy to use device, what makes this phone stand out if the fact that it is now the only smart phone with a Web browser that has flash player. With the range of frequencies this device supports I have yet to experience a dropped call or slow data speeds. The on screen keyboard is also a huge pro to using a blackberry device as it is responsive yet accurate. In other words every word isn't unintentionally replaced by auto spell. Battery life is average but you can physically remove the battery should you need a new one. My only gripe or con is the current lack of apps through the blackberry world store, with that being said check into side loading and the benefits it has til blackberry catches up.",2014年1月13日 在美国审核
Best Phone You Haven't Had,"Pros: I was an early adopter of the Z10 and purchased as soon as it was available in the US, so I've been using the Z10 for about a year and a half now. As of today, this phone still feels new to me, especially with OS (operating system updates).Physically: The phone feels great in the hand, with a textured back door that's inviting to touch. The screen display is beautiful and excellent quality. I've dropped the phone more than a few times on hard surfaces and still no cracks. Also, even though I have a privacy screen on my phone, I still get ooo's and ahhh's when showing pictures or video to others. Two cameras(front/back) come in handy and I've taken some awesome shots from several trips and events. There's also a standard mini-USB port for charging, mini-HDMI port which works perfectly with a standard HDMI to mini-HDMI cable. One other major point to note is the microSD (extra memory) slot. In the phone specs, it says up to 32gb capacity, but I can confirm since day one, I've been able to use a 64gb microSD. With the release of upcoming OS updates, this has been tested with a 128gb microSD.Internally: (understand I'm a bit more techhy than average user). When switching from other phones or even old BB devices, be aware that this new user interface is different but more intuitive. In the first 24-48 hours, you'll be trying to understand how everything works, so don't let it frustrate you. Hearing about hub and flow doesn't truly make sense until you've got the phone set up with your email and social accounts. Then you realize just how beautiful and clean and easy this is to use. Lots of customizable features and options that can help save or drain your battery depending on your personal use. With the latest OS update (10.3...), you will have access to the Amazon App Store as well as Blackberry World (BB's app store). One point of interest is that this Blackberry OS is capable of running Android apps and games as it has technical capabilities to do so. For the curious folks that believe they'll miss their Android apps and games, not true. Crackberry.com has plenty of instructional documents as does Youtube on how to sideload. I personally sideloaded an app called Snap that actually gives me access to the Google store right from my Z10. I can download apps on the go. Also, note that due to Blackberry data packaging technology, you'll consume less data overall compared to other brands. BBM (BlackBerry Messenger) that you've known or heard of, is now even better with voice calling and video calling embedded, plus its available on other platforms. Last but not least, the security that Blackberry is know for is still the best there in the business.Next to the security, BBM, and fluidity of the device, my favorite feature has to be the ability to upload/download directly to my pc from anywhere. I have cloud storage for when/if I need it, but for true security, I can transfer directly between my Z10 and my pc (or any pc I authorize) securely.Cons: Every once in a while an app may crash but these are typically Android apps, but wait a few seconds and you're able to restart the app w/o rebooting the phone completely.Honestly, the biggest issue is not with the phone itself, it's the carriers in the US not rolling out OS updates timely. The rest of the world where Blackberry is thriving receives regular timely updates, while the US carriers lag far behind. This is where Crackberry.com and reading comprehension comes in handy. With a little reading, this issue can easily be overcome by updating the OS using a non-US carrier update. Haven't found any issues doing beyond perhaps having a foreign carrier icon appear in my apps which can easily be deleted. All other functions work perfect.Overall from day one this phone was a good start for the new line of Blackberries, but with each OS update, this phone has become AWESOME! The best part is that there is still so much more potential for this phone to grow and do even more. This phone is a unrecognized diamond.",2014年9月22日 在美国审核
Excellent Phone,"First off, I am a blackberry user through and through.I use my phone more for business than for gaming or other mind numbing activities.I purchased this as an unlocked unit; this is not the same version sold in the US, it does NOT have LTE.That being said, it has quad band hspa+ up to 21mbps.This is fast enough to stream netflix, watch online videos, and use maps on the go.Plus, the battery life on the STl 100-1 is slightly better than the STL 100-3 found in the US (ATT/Verizon).I love the speed of the phone, the interface, and overall fit and finish.",2013年5月7日 在美国审核
One of the bests smartphones ever made,"I bought this phone following all the comparison and rating posts on amazon youtube and all other technology related blogs and sites. Disregarding all the financial and trending status of the company Blackberry. And by now this is the most stable, reliable and smooth platform where that i ever worked on a smartphone. Before i had a samsung S3 mini and it was not bad. But had a lot of bugs and virtual memory speed turn offs, not to mention the battery short life. I'm really happy with this phone and i will have it until the company problems affect the good service on my handheld or until i have to change it for renewing technology reasons. I'm really not a follower, i research before to buy and the relation quality/price in this phone is really superior than any other device ever made. Definitely I recommend it.

Great Blackberry Legacy,"Good phone, works fine with wifi too. Purchased it as secondary phone to play with. Have used Blackberry phones in the past. Sadly thery're shuttingdown the Blackberry Appt Store at the end of this year. Screen resolution is good for this mid range smartphone. Not an iPhone X type but is indeed a good, solidsmartphone. Got the latestupdate same night that I got the phone. Please note this is not a Blackberry dressed with Android. This model was manufactured back in 2015 if I'm correct. You won't find a fingerprint sensor or face id. But it's worthy the experience as long as you want a good phone with lots of security features Blackberry is known. The default messenger BBM consumer version was put to rest recently on May the 31st but you can still get the flavor of the messenger platform through the Enterprise version free for a year then you would pay a very reasonable price that everyone can afford",2019年6月8日 在美国审核

The Z10 sold by Tradewind International is AT&amp;T compliant,"Tradewind International's seller page makes clear that this Z10 is manufactured for use on AT&amp;T.And, it comes in an AT&amp;T box and has an AT&amp;T logo on the back.I checked with Tradewind prior to purchase and they were very helpful in helping me to understand that their Z10 was an AT&amp;T Z10.I use the Consumer Cellular / AT&amp;T network.Although Consumer Cellular is reluctant to confirm that Blackberrys work on their system, AT&amp;T does offer Blackberry phones.The Z10 uses the OS 10.2. operating system, different from earlier Blackberry phones, and so, can be fully functional on a network like that of Consumer Cellular - as my two are.However, not all Z10s are the same even if they are the same model and advertised as ""unlocked"".One must be very careful to chose a version that will work on the network they intend to use.The first Z10 I bought through Amazon worked perfectly and was fully functional.The second, which was the same model, did not.That phone did not allow the APN to be set and saved and, therefore, mobile data service was not available although everything else worked fine.I returned that initial second purchase and Amazon was very, very accommodating and replaced it with the Z10 from Tradewind.That one also works perfectly.Amazon seems to feature specific seller each day.But, when clicked on, that listing also shows what other sellers also have a Z10.If information is not available on the Amazonlisting for a seller as to which network the Z10 is manufactured for, then I suggest you email the seller as I did.Buy a Z10 only from a seller who will tell you what networks their Z10 will work on.As I said, I highly recommend Tradewind.They were very helpful to me.",2014年5月29日 在美国审核

I knew it before I bought it,"I bought this phone for someone else, but I do own one as well. I like this phone, no doubt; I'm not so much into millions apps, i'm more on the productivity side. No surprise except the model STL100-1, which is the 3Gonly model. No big deal because 4G is NOT coming to the country where it is used now anytime soon...You will be frustrated if you are used to the android system (I used to have a galaxy nexus) because the only google support is synchronizing of e-mail / calendar /contacts, yes there is a a crippled Google talk and nice Youtube but need ""built for blackberry"" version. Not bad but sometimes, google video chat is convenient too for communication. Other google products suck as keep or google search are still missing.Here are some of the apps that came with it:Docs to Go , File Manager, Print to Go Adobe reader, Remember (Evernote), Dropbox,I added Camera Scanner, SIP.fm a very nice SIP app, NYTimes, The guardian, Sky scanner, Google Talk, Tube Map, The guardian, TuneIn radio, Skype...The battery life is OK, just slightly better that say my Galaxy nexus. Charging every couple days in normal use and everyday in heavy use. It has a better reception than my galaxy nexus for sure...I like the fact that the battery is user replaceable, and I think NFC is not on the battery but rather on the battery cover which is better in term of cost if you want additional battery.I like the BB OS 10, there are still lots of room for improvement (Hub on wake up screen for instance) but I do like the more professional side of it. Having both personal space and professional space (BB Balance) is just the best.I'm thinking of giving my phone to someone and get the Q10. I'm happy with the BB10.",2013年9月10日 在美国审核

The phones fast and responsive and the keyboard is one of the best touch screen keyboards I have ever used.

The app world have several apps but I never really cared for apps but to me a lot of the apps look good even if they are side loads. Give this phone a try.Update November 4,2013: Have had this phone for 4 months and loving it. I have updated it to 10.2 and am enjoying the new features it has to offer. My favorite new feature is the toast notifications which let you reply to a message without leaving a app. also with 10.2 all bugs that were bothering me have been fixed and no more glitches. I'm glad to see that the app store is getting better with more high quality games. Still waiting for more exclusive apps but they are starting to trickle in.

VERIZON MODEL SUPPORTS FEWER GSM FREQUENCIES,"As others have noted be careful which model you are ordering. I was expecting the factory unlocked version but what I got was the Verizon model. It says Verizon on the front and back and it has a different network radio than the standard unlocked version. The Verizon model does support both CDMA and GSM but is supports fewer GSM frequencies vs the factory unlocked version. The phone is unlocked though as I could access the APN settings. But for some reason I couldn't get MMS to work on my carrier (voice, SMS and data worked). This is the first phone I haven't been able to get MMS working on and I've used many different OSes including those that are not iOS or Android.I'm not sure what I should rate this as I feel duped into getting the Verizon version. The product description does not mention CDMA or Verizon anywhere. I'm trying to return now. The seller I bought it through on here (Mango Wireless) wants me to pay a 15% restocking fee plus pay return shipping.",2014年11月5日 在美国审核

Awsome phone but...,"I got this Z10 phone to replace my old Blackberry Bold and I was very pleased with the features, look and feel until I went to my service provider to have the data plan transfered. This STL100-2 I received would not connect to their network. I am not able to expound on the technical details and will emphatically state that the inability to get the data plan transferred was not due to any faulty features of the phone but was due to the provider.Buyers beware! Check with your phone service provider before purchasing to ensure that this model will connect to their network, be it 2G, 3G or 4G.The touch key pad will take some getting used to.

WRONG LISTING!,"People please read! This is a wrong and misleading listing! On the item description part it said ""the LATEST model"" which should be STL 100-4 that supports 4G LTE. I called Amazon twice before I place the order to make sure that the sellers are listing under the correct title and both of them assured me that. I placed an order and still received a STL 100-1, which is the EARLIEST model, not the latest model. It does not support 4G. This phone is an awesome phone, coming from someone who dropped iPhone 5s for this one. It's faster, more functional and there is a lot of things you can program to make this phone unique to you. 4G is slow enough for this phone's capacity, much less 3G.I'd give it a 1 star if Amazon wouldn't take their wrong item back and give me a full refund.",2014年4月16日 在美国审核

Pay attention to what model you are getting!,"I read through many reviews on the Z10 before purchasing it from Amazon and I have to say that I am glad I did. The seller Tailwind International has (at the time of this writing) STL1000-3 models (which have LTE) that are factory unlocked from AT&amp;T. I would HIGHLY recommend them as they are very helpful. In case anyone reading this review is thinking about putting this phone on straight talk wireless service, know that I was able to successfully get this device working on ST's service with Data, MMS, voice, and texting all working fairly easily (But do this at your own risk as things could change!).As for the device itself, I originally had an old BlackBerry Curve so I've been blown away by what this device can do (and the STL1000-3 comes with the snapdragon processor, which makes it super snappy!). The hub keeps everything in one spot so that you can check messages of multiple accounts at a glance. I haven't had it running long enough to go into detail about the battery life, but from what I've seen the battery is fairly good in getting through a work day of heavy use (if you turn off bluetooth, etc.).Overall I really love this device and am glad to have something that is so functional, professional, yet fun at the same time. It takes a little getting used to with the swipes and all, but once you have that down it's a breeze.",2014年6月8日 在美国审核
except for lack of WMA support it is a great phone,"Really a great phone. I have had it for a few months now and love it as a phone.

I have to use my wife's Windows phone (also a great phone (Lumia) when in a making calls and receiving them overseas. The usual lack of apps is not as much of a big deal for me. I love the hub and don't miss the physical keyboard anymore. For my work it is still the only phone because of the Blackberry enterprise server.

I'm talking about the user interface (UI) I am constantly phantom swiping, then I realize I have to look for buttons/keys, etc. Why should I have to look around click the 'back' arrow a dozen times to get out of an app?

Not for T-Mobile users!!!!!,"I ordered this phone because I wanted to replace my Z10 that I accidentally dropped in the toilet. I really liked my phone and didnt want to get anything different so when I found this phone on Amazon for a decent price I was super excited. However, once it was delivered and my sim card put in, it would not pickup T-Mobile's data. So long story short since I have T-Mobile service this phone will not work since they have different band technology. I love my Z10 and thought this would help. So if you have T-Mobile don't waste your time getting this phone. Find one that's branded for T-Mobile, the technology is different than the Verizon branded ones.

Gr8 phone but use caution when purchasing.,"Phone is a great phone, nonetheless, BB doesn't have many Apps that we're used to.***Contact seller BEFORE purchase and ensure the model that is being sent; most sellers are sending the STL 100-4 which is Verizon-labeled phone w/ only one LTE frequency (Verizon's).AT&amp;T ""Edge"" network will work, but very slow.3G &amp; LTE will not work with STL 100-4.Don't let seller talk you into ""this phone will work with ATT/T-mobile"" -they're only telling U half-truth.For North America, The STL 100-3 is the model you want, but be advised that there are two sub-models of the STL 100-3:- RFK121LW (similar to the later, but has an extra LTE frequency that works with T-mobile -as well as AT&amp;T.)- RFF91LW (AT&amp;T version)Before purchasing send seller the Amazon ASIN# that you're inquiring to buy and ensure the following:1. Is an UNBRANDED (i.e. no cell carrier name on the phone such as AT&amp;T/Verizon)2. Is the Model a RFK121LW or RFF91LW? (...both are STL 100-3)3. Ensure phone is either NEW, refurbished, or used (whatever your preference).4. Ensure phone is factory UNLOCKED.if the seller seems like a swindler, stay away.When u return the product they'll try to charge you $100+ ""Restocking fees"".If that happens complain with Amazon.Good luck.",2015年7月27日 在美国审核

Great phone,"It's very unfortunate that this phone has not taken off like some of the Android phones or like the iPhone. This is a great product, specially with the amount of features it has.Pros:-Can do Bluetooth Audio to my car and to headsets.-Can use Allplay with samsung TVs. I have seen delays maybe once or twice, but most of the time is just perfect stream of Audio/video from the phone to the TV.-8mp camera-BBM can now be used via WiFi. No more Data plan required for this feature. Furthermore, you can use BBM video chat.-Maps is way better than the new maps application on the iPhone.-includes excel, word, powerpoint (Docs To Go)-By default it comes with facebootk/twitter and a few other social applications for those who are interested.-Latest update 10.2.1537 has improved a lot of things, such as the calendar, added a flashlight application and a lot of other UI enhancements, including the ability to install Android applications (apk) to our phone.-Multi window view is great.Cons:Not enough native applications.Going to the home screen can sometimes be a shore. Unlike android phones or iPhone, there is no button to take you to home, so you have to slide your finger from the Blackberry logo to the center of the screen.

Great storage space and the option to expand.Cons: When I first received it I was disappointed to see that it had verizon's logo all over it (advertiser didn't specify that). It was unlocked as specified but I couldn't use data services due to locked (verizon) APN settings. However, this was resolved with an OS upgrade. Finally, if I'm running an app (especially a high graphic game) the surface of the phone gets hot to the touch and making a call can be uncomfortable.",2014年1月3日 在美国审核

The form factor is compelling,"Background, I own every iPhone to iPhone 5 alongside with the iPadI love this blackberry Z10 and the most thing I love about it is form factor 4.2"" and it looks like the back of iPhone 5I've read many reviews comparing this to iPhone but I can only compare this to iPhone 5 and someone may compare Z30 to iPhone 5s1) I don't see the lack of home button as a bless for this phone in contrary it's not a user friendly as someone may think. I have had many calls dropped while walking because Z10 screen rubbed against my pocket and this has never happened to my iPhone 5. I use (Plantronic Bluetooth headset)Pressing home button is like one spot action while swiping up require extra perimeter. Finally I disabled the feature and using power/wake button instead.2) cloud; I am a heavy user when it comes to Notes (I'm writing this on my iPad's Notes app) whatever I wrote on this Note could be seen and completed on my iPhone 5, and the same goes to Pages and Numbers which I have on both iDevices, I missed many cloud based features that I use on my iPhone 5 even password keeper on Z10 isn't integrated with the cloud or works across the multi platforms as Enpass app3) App Store; I have Amazon App Store and Snap installed on my Z10 to complement Blackberry World, all of them put together seem like a tiny rat before a huge elephant in comparison to Apple App Store. I side loaded many android apps to account for the shortage yet all went in vain because they are buggy, laggy and crashy. Moreover, you can't even install google service dependent apps on Z10 flawlessly, patching and debugging couldn't solve the dilemma.4) the battery is buzzing bug on Z10, it drains fast as if there is an electric leakage hole on it, I thought it's going be like iPhone 5 battery but that wasn't the case at all, it worse than iPhone 5 battery despite being 1800 mAh more than iPhone 5 offerThe BB10 OS is good and I really like it, I like its integration with many installed apps weather they are native apps or ported ones.ProForm factor, nice built and well craftedBB10 OS, I'm currently on 10.2.2.1531Integration of many appsConBatteryBatteryBatteryBlackberry World needs more app (Snap and Amazon Appstore offer apps that are not natively fit or matched)BIS needs cloud integration, S/MIME, a wide recognizable VPN and so on",2014年8月11日 在美国审核

Get it Straight: GSM or CDMA???? Works with T-Mobile or Verizon?????,"According to the description, the phone I received was supposed to be an unlocked cell phone phone, with no logos on it other than that of the Blackberry logo, and it is supposed to be ""compatible with GSM carriers like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile [...] and not work with CDMA Carriers like Sprint, Verizon, Boost or Virgin.""I have T-Mobile, and although the phone accepts the card, even with my unlimited 4GLTE data plan, I cannot get 3G and 4G signal. The highest speed I see is E, and I feel like I am ten years behind in internet speed. The description clearly states not compatible with Verizon, however, the Verizon logo is clearly all over the front and back of the cell phone. Therefore, I feel I did not get the product I paid for, and I am not content as the description and images do not match the product itself. I have to order another cell phone to be able to use my data plan.",2016年8月4日 在美国审核

All Z10 STL100-3 phones are NOT the same!,"Blackberry makes variations of the STL100-3 Z10.This vendor is selling the Verizon version (RFF91LW). None of the Verizon phones are considered 'Factory Unlocked', since they are locked to Verizon by Blackberry at the time of manufacture. Therefore, any RFF91LW that is unlocked cannot accurately be claimed to be 'Factory Unlocked'. It would have to be unlocked by a 3rd Party.Next, and perhaps most important, the Verizon version is the 'Tri-band' RFF91LW and does not include the HSPA (UMTS 4 band) 1700 frequency, like its 'Quad-band' counterpart the RFK121LW.The only performance distinction between these models is that if you use the RFF91LWon T-Mobile in a non-4G LTE area, you will be unable to achieve 3G performance and the phone will drop to 2G performance levels. If the phone is used in a T-mobile 4G LTE service area, there would be no performance difference at all (in the U.S.; performance on some Canadian carriers may vary). When you order a Z10 directly from Blackberry, they offer only the RFK121LW and is available for about the same price from a variety of sources. TheBlackberry Z10 is an amazing value at the prices currently available from this and other vendors. This information is offered to help all Z10 shoppers make an informed buying decision and for no other reason.",2014年6月1日 在美国审核

Doesn't work outside of the USA as advertised,"I bought this device and rushed it to my home before traveling out of the country. It was advertised as ""unlocked"" and ready to work internationally. It wasn't. Once in the country I visited, I went to a store of the most popular carrier in the region to buy a SIM card. They spent nearly an hour trying to configure its settings (I was surprised one of the techs even changed the language of the device to English so he could work better). They tried all possible configurations but none worked. They concluded I needed the original SIM card from verizon to change some settings for the cell phone to work in their network, without it they couldn't help me. I was so devastated, I spent good money for this phone and for it not to work as advertised. I ended up getting a cheap phone for the two weeks I was there.

Being unlocked (but having a Verizon logo on it),most GSM carriers do not allow the phone to connect to 3G/4G. EDGE is the fastest connectivity for this phone. This ruins the user experience. Do not buy this phone is you plan on using it on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile. To top it, these carriers have woeful customer service and shrug their shoulders when you request a solution.Specific information: This is a STL100-4 model.

MOBILE HOT SPOT,"I bought the Z10 to replace my Blackberry 9900. I liked the 9900 but wanted the newest phone and the larger screen. The transition to the virtual keyboard has been easier than I thought and the other features, which I'm learning seem nice.The problem is, and the only reason I didn't rate this 5 Stars, that I can't seem to set up the Mobile Hot Spot feature with AT&amp;T. I bought this phone planning on using that feature for my upcoming vacation. I spent 3 hours on the phone with AT&amp;T. I have the correct data plan but the phone keeps saying that I ""need to have a hot spot data plan"" set up. I don't know what to do but have another call with AT&amp;T set up for next week.The phone I have is version STL-2 (ATT sells STL-3).

Black is Back!,"First of all, I got mine from TMO under a business account.Though I think that my first hand experience with the phone should be helpful for those of you buying this phone from Amazon.After weeks of use, here is what I gather for both major Pros and Cons.Pros:1. OS - The new Hub, Peek and Flow are superbly implemented. It may feel weird at first, but it takes no time for me to master my phone. The phone runs fast and doesn't get hot under heavy uses. It gets slightly warm though on the back.2. Browser - This is the fastest I have seen till date. It has flash player which you can enable or disable. With my unlimited 4G data, I have been able to watch series or movies from HBO GO in HD quality! It is a little bit difficult to move through the web, but doable.3. Look and Feel - This can be subjective. I personally feel that it looks modern, light and has very sleek slim profile.4. Quality - It is made of mostly plastic, which doesn't bother me. Though the plastic material doesn't feel cheap when hold in my hands. The screen resolution is the best in the market right now. However, the color saturation, contrast, etc may not be the best. Though I don't think human eyes can perceive any significant difference.5. Virtual Keyboard - I can't believe that I could end up liking the phone as I tried iPhone since those old days. I couldn't get myself to use it even when I tried the newer one like 4S or 5. Even on the new Android, I got frustrated all the time using its virtual keyboard.Z10 keyboard software is the best right now in the market largely due to its words auto correction ability. I just couldn't believe that I can type almost as fast with hardly any mistakes with Z10 virtual keyboard. The word flicking feature is such an icing on the cake!6. Removable back cover - Well, most of these days modern touch screen smart phone doesn't have this. With Z10, you have option to use a back up battery when you need it. In addition, you could use up to 64GB sd memory card though you will need to set up the card in a correct way before Z10 will accept the card. Otherwise, by default Z10 will take up to 32GB sd memory card.7. Call quality and Reception - Well, the most important feature about the phone is to make and receive calls! So far the calls have been very loud and clear. It is easy to use. A few things I don't like is that I can't seem to be able to copy number from the web and paste it onto call window to make a call! Also, I do hope that TMO bring OS update to add WiFi calling features soon.....There are more, but I should move on...Cons:1. Apps - Not much there. But I only a short list, which is Skype, Instagram, Watch ESPN and HBO GO. Yes, on EPSN and HBO GO, I can use desktop web browser and make it work. However, having these apps would make my life a lot easier. Then I can stop borrowing my wife iPhone from time to time to watch sport games :-)2. Customization - The notable one is notifications. With older Blackberry, you could set a profile where your ringtone for phone and/or SMS, BBM, etc will ring at different level. That is gone! Also, there is a slight glitch where when I set my phone to ""Phone Call Only"" it stops my virtual keyboard sound. Sometimes it does, sometimes not. Well, in short, I can do way more on this notifications customization with my older Blackberry than my new Z10. Perhaps there will be an app for that!!!3. Email - This supposes to be the strongest feature of any Blackberry devices. However, gone is the ability to store emails on your device more than 30days - what gives!Yes, you can search the server on certain email protocols, but I know many colleges who won't use Z10 because of this. Well, they love to keep email on their phones 2-3 years way back.I know that this 30 days email sync is similar to many other phone platforms, but why removing one of its strongest features! I do hope that it will be fixed with OS update to be able to archive email on device of memory cards soon.In summary, I highly recommend the phone if you aren't rely heavily on apps.The battery is not the best thing, but is on par with the likes in the market - but with ability to swap out a back up battery.You should find it very easy to learn and master this phone in less than a week.I am sure though that given the time, apps can only improve as user base grows. Well, Black is Back!",2013年4月2日 在美国审核

"Good phone for native BB users. But, it is not good for who came from another platform.","First of all, before I bought Z10 I have Galaxy S3, Iphone 4 and Nokia lumia 920.This phone is my first Blackberry phone. I just wanted to try BB and see what is the new BB10.In fact, Z10 has a nice design and stylish. Many people asked me about the type of this phone and many could not believe that this is a bb Phone because they used to see BB with physical keyboard.I liked it at the first days. I liked how the hub works and how my emails organised with my other accounts (like Facebook and Twitter).The typing on keyboard is awesome (you should watch it on youtube), The YouTube works even when the screen dims (this is really a great feature that is missing in all other platforms), so I can listen to the music that I easily find in YouTube and lock the screen. Also, Z10 has a great clear sound when I use my SAMSUNG headphone because the headphone that came with Z10 is terrible. Simply, the design, typing style, YouTube unique feature and the great sound were the best things that I experienced with this phone.Now, you might ask yourself why I gave this gadget just two stars with this good criteria.Okay, here is the bad part:-As I told you in the beginning, this is my first Blackberry device, I expected something much higher (woow). I bought it by $650, which extremely expensive for that phone.I started to experience many problems related to YouTube crashing and slow download, I compared the speed of music playing with my 3 other phones and all of them beat Z10.Whats app, which is recently ported to Blackberry World, works very bad. My friends text me and the text appears after few minutes (the same happened when I reply them), so I experiences delay in communication. The hub looks very nice but I used to hear my Lumia and Galaxy ringing when a new E-Mail received then after 30 minutes or more, I receive the same mail. I tried to reduce the time of synchronizing to the minimum limit (15 mins) but nothing has changed.The Camera is terrible and took very crappy images compared to Nokia Lumia 920 or even Galaxy S3. However, it is still better than the ones in Iphone 4.There is always wrong notification in the hub of new email or message or voice mail which is so confucing. I tried many times to erase the notifications or restart my phone, but nothing changed.The device heated many times when I play games on it and drain the battery quickly.Blackberry map or the navigator is non reliable with poor directions and slow road recalculation compared to the fantastic Google maps and the very best Nokia here.The worst part in Z10 is Blackberry world (Apps store) which is extremely awful. No Viber, no skype, no Instagram, no Mobile Voip, No Bank of America, Whats app that is recently being available for Z10 is very lame and not reliable, Very bad ring tones (just I wanted to replace the few and miserable native ringtones with new ones in the store, and I could not find good tones either), very old and obsolete games or apps. Most if not all Android ported apps works terribly on Z10 and I uninstall them after checking.Simply, the apps store is non-functional and useless. I used to take my galaxy S3 with me to make viber calls with my family and later dropped whats app from the Z10 and kept using it on the Galaxy S3.I had to give the Z10 at least 3 stars, but the very high price precluded me from doing this. The price should be not more than $350 for this mediocre phone.I gave Nokia Lumia 920 4 stars because of one problem that is related toWP store, which is now much more mature than BB store and is keeping in progress. However Nokia's hardware is the best among every manufacturer and I amazed by the power of Lumia 920 and its great features. on the other hand, few features in Z10 amazed me compared to many bad problems in this phone.In conclusion, If you used to have, and kept using BB phones, go and buy this Z10. You will love it. Two of my friends, who are BB old users, bought this and adored it. It is a great idea to change your old Kia Rio with a new beautiful Honda Accord.If you are coming from Apple, Android, or Nokia WP, Please don't buy it. I don't think that you want to leave you Mercedes Benz CLS and jump to Honda Accord, or buy a new Accord with the same price that you paid for your Mercedes CLS.You would see a huge difference in the platform features, usage and performance. It is really boring and non-functional as the other three OS.I tried to be neutral and say the whole truth, and I'm ready if you have any question.Thank you..",2013年4月12日 在美国审核

"Great phone and OS, but want to point out a few things","I didn't buy this phone thru Amazon.com but thru a local TMo store via their $99/down and pay-off-the-phone-in-24-installments plan. This is the second Z10 phone I've owned, since after 6 months of use from first release, the phone started acting up (random swiping on its own; activating apps on its own esp. the camera app and taking photos all by itself; touchscreen unresponsive; phone overheating). Went back to the same TMo store I bought it from where they made arrangements for UPS to deliver a replacement phone in 2 days in exchange for my defective phone.I didn't bother to see which model Z10 phone I originally owned, but my replacement phone is the STL100-3 with the latest 10.1.0.4200 OS release. I restored my backup file to this phone via BlackBerry Link Software with no problem. I have since obtained thru Amazon.com a 4500mah batt which allows it run 1 1/2 days (as opposed to the 1/2 day with the stock 1800mah batt).You can read the other reviews here how good/bad people's experiences with the Z10. To sum up it's been good for me. Malfunctioning 1st phone aside, one gripe I have is the Remember app and its voice recording feature which works more-or-less advertised, yet I don't completely trust. A few times after I've completed a recording, I've hit the ""Cancel"" button on the upper left-hand corner and lost said recording forever, without a prompt to tell me ""are you sure"" if I want to delete it. Another thing about the voice recording feature is that a couple of times, the app has failed to save the audio file properly that even the phone itself can't even recognize it as a playable file! I have since resorted back to using a good old tape recorder to record my lectures and interviews.I find the phone hard to hold to take a photo, since the entire LCD becomes the shutter button and too many times I've taken inadvertent shots by placing my fingers on the LCD. The quality of the photos is not up to par to even my 6 y/o Sony p/s digicam, even though both shoot at 8mp resolution (examining detail when images are zoomed in reveal the Z10 is inferior).The 4"" size of the Z10 is the perfect size for a handheld phone; 5+"" is unwieldy and looks positively ridiculous against my face when making a voice call.If you're an chronic app junkie, this phone is not for you. However there are more than enough useful apps to make this a perfectly usable phone.The phone UI is smooth, stable, unfancy, conservative; gets the job done. It's not glitzy or schmaltzy like an Android or Apple phone. It's a very adult, boring. If you like adult and boring, this phone is for you. This phone certainly is for me. I would suggest people try it out if given the opportunity. It just plain works and works very well. //",2013年10月12日 在美国审核
what an underrated phone!,"Coming from a longtime iPhone and Android user, I must say this is the best phone I have ever used/owned..by far.When my last phone had made its last call and it was time for a new one, the search for the right phone was on. With so many different types to choose from the task quickly became daunting. The new shiny iPhone 6 just came out along with the highly anticipated Samsung note 4 to be released on top of all the other great phones availableon the market today.The only thing I knew was that I needed something different. For as great as these phones are, they simply weren't meeting my needs. They were great as mini media devices but not for writing emails or anything more professional.I did hours of research (thanks YouTube! ) on the different phones available. I must have changed my mind a hundred times. Although investing in a phone seems pretty cut and dry, I wanted to make sure the next phone I got would work for me. After a while I came across the z30 and was very impressed. Unfortunately Verizon no longer had them in stock which was a real bummer. The sales rep kept telling me how great the new iPhone was and how it was better than the one before it ( may be slightly different but they are all the same, I've owned 3 plus macbooks and ipads). Still being stuck on wanting a BlackBerry I decided to go with the little sister of the z30 and chose the z10. I am SO happy with my decision !Now I'm no techy by any means, but here is what I love about my new phone:- this phone is lightening fast. I can navigate at a very fastspeeds regardless of how many apps are open- keyboard is amazingly responsive and has incredibly accurate predictive text-camera is cool. Now I love my ipad mini camera a little more only because I'm so used to it but this offers several great settings and I love that I can tap the screen anywhere to take a picture. I'm sure once I get the hang of it I will love it just as much.- the hub is genius. So easy to navigate through the several business emails and business applications all within one screen.-battery life is great. About three times longer than my DROID of iPhone..no joke.-calls are clear and peaker is loudAll in all this is such a wonderful phone with a great, user friendly interface. The only thing I would request on this device is for some business apps such as Ringcentral to be available via the app store but honestly I can do without it and just use that app on my ipad mini.Very happy with this phone. I hope that blackberry takes back the throne of the smartphone kingdom or at least gains the larger client base it deserves. They gained a forever customer today. Excited for the revival of blackberry!!",2014年10月4日 在美国审核
Everything you've been told about this phone is A LIE.,"Or *probably* everything you've been told about this phone is a lie. Why? Smartphone marketing is a brutal battlefield, and I kind of want to smack BB's marketing department upside the head for not getting the word out properly on the astounding awesomeness of this phone.***And yes, make sure you're buying the correct model. I have the STL 100-2, 100-3, or 100-4. I have 100-3.***I'm going to start from the beginning with the actual user experience and tell you what this phone does.I will also say I bought this phone from my carrier with admittedly serious doubts about whether it would be worth my money or if I should go back to another platform.The most important feature of the BB10 Operating System is the Hub.The Hub is a consolidated communications center. Add your email account(s), Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn(if you use that), and Evernote accounts. Now everything you use is all in one place. Calendar is integrated too. It's awesome. Go into the hub. Tap ""compose."" Choose your weapon - from any of the above mentioned accounts you added, and including text messages, etc. Pick your recipient(s). Type message using the awesome keyboard (which I'll cover later). Tap send.Done. No BS, just direct and easy messaging.I will warn you that FB defaults to importing everything like birthdays. I didn't like that, some people might. You can edit all that for each account you add.In an app like the full FB app? Need to do something in the Hub? Swipe up from the bottom bezel area to mid-screen, then to the right. You're in the hub. No hunting for messages, use the excellent search function. No switching between email and Twitter to find something, it's all right there. The app you were in stays open and running until you close it.Want to see only texts or emails or whatever? Tap ""Hub"" in the lower left or swipe to the right again, and pick the account you want to view. Done.Here's where it gets really interesting and important: when you are using a native ""app"" or a 3rd party one with Hub integration, things get really easy. Say you're surfing the web. You find an interesting web site you want to show your friend. What do you do? Tap the browser menu, tap ""share,"" and pick your method (text, email, etc.) and recipient. BAM. Done.Just took an awesome photo? Same process... which also allows you to upload it to Facebook, etc.Sharing of your own files, photos etc. gets even cooler though. When working with a file on your phone (photo, a doc you typed, etc.), from the file browser (or direct photo browser if you prefer), you can Share via ANY account you have added (Twitter, FB, email, etc., as well as Bluetooth, add it to BB Remember, or the best: NFC. NFC is awesome and quicker, or at least I think so. Touch your NFC enabled phones together. File Transfers. Done.Which brings us to the ""File Manager.""What *can't* you do with this?? Nothing I've found so far. Move files (including between device and Micro SD Card), copy, rename, delete files, share files via the above outlined process (easy-peasy). ZIP Files into Archives for goodness sake. Unzip archives. Send said Archives via chosen method. Switch between ""list"" view and ""tiles"" view, whatever you prefer. Search. Sort. Browse. Whatever you want.Want Cloud backup? Integrated Dropbox. You can even tell Dropbox NOT to use the mobile network if you're concerned about data usage. Same for ""Box."" Holy cloud storage, batman!Active Frames: Basically, when you open an app, it stays open and live until you close it. Swipe right (to go to the left of your main/home screen), and they'll be there, hanging out and being awesome. Re-maximise it by tapping, or tap the ""x"" in the lower right hand corner of the app / frame to close. Done.Contacts: if your contacts are on a web email account, once you add the account, they will get imported. Got a few accounts? Adding Facebook? Worried about duplicates? Easy. My Z10 took care of merging most of them for me, but missed a few mostly because of my friends' propensity to use wacky names on Facebook. What do you do? Link them. Tap the contact, tap ""Link,"" tap ""add Link,"" select the right contact to ""Link"" (merge), and they get merged. No BS, no nonsense, it just gets done. You can apply the reverse process if you want to unlink contacts.Add multiple email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, all of your designation (home, work, other, etc).Set a specific ringtone to the person - but not just a ringtone; vibrate, LED, emails from that contact... all customizable. All from one place.Looking at that contact? Want to know what they've been up to? Tap ""Activity"" in their Contacts entry. Any and all activity from your phone relating to that person - emails, texts, phone calls, appointments from your calendar that list that person... all listed right there.Calendar: Pretty straight forward... or is it??Choose your view: Day, Week, Month. Search your calendar by name of event ""subject,"" attendees/participants, locations, and even notes you put on the appointment.My personal favourite view is ""Month."" Why? The day you tap on shows your schedule... and here's where it gets cool: the busier you are on that day, the bigger the date number gets. Seriously. You will know at a glance just how busy you are, and of course your specific appointments are listed right there too.Keyboard: I was very leery of going back to a touchscreen keyboard. Boy was I wrong.This phone learns how you type. Seriously. If you say, keep hitting the ""v"" when you meant to hit ""b"", it will learn that. Heat sensors study where you tend to tap on the keyboard. The predictive text is not only an awesome approach but it is eerily smart. While typing, words will pop up on the keyboard. Type in the letter ""Y,"" and above the ""O"" key will be the word ""you."" flick the word up towards the message. Basically, it draws logical conclusions based on language AND your personal language usage habits to determine that if the next letter you want is ""e,"" this is likely the word you want. It gets smarter with more usage.Notifications / Ringtones: set profiles AND set separate tones for phone, email (each account), texts, etc. etc. Awesome.Camera: Rear facing 8mp with flash and 1080px 30fps vido, and other fancy stuff. Front facing is 2MP. Just go read the specs.The camera rules. No, I have not done extensive, multiple light level testing. What I have done is taken loads of photos of my friends and my dog, and even some nature scenery. I love it. Timeshift is really cool, it's not just a ""burst"" mode, it's more. Go watch a video, this review is long enough as it is.The screen of your BB10 has an unobtrusive permanent ""bar"" at the bottom that has Phone, Search, and Camera. Right there. No flicking around to find the ""app.""You can drag the focus to anywhere in the frame you want. You can set flash to off, auto, or on. You can choose the Scene mode (auto, night, etc.). The two things I find to be the best? You tap *anywhere* on the screen to take the photo, and the photo you just took is sitting in the lower left corner. Drag it up to ""peek"" at it to see if you got the shot you want, or tap on it to open the photo and access the editing/sharing capabilities.Photo editing and capabilities: Share photos as outlined above. Set as wallpaper. Edit photo with the built in photo editing suite which includes:Transform: resize, rotate, free resize or rotate, mirror, and crop with a handy perfect square shape option and predefined standard ratios;Enhance: Auto, remove red eye, brightness, white balance, contrast, sharpness, hue saturation, and noise reduction;Artistic: B&amp;W, Lomo, Antique, Sepia, Whiteboard, Watercolor, Negative, and SketchStyles: Beautify or ""Big Eyes"" (for detectable faces), ""Sixties"" (as in retro look), Grain, Aged Photo (looks like an aged photo taped into an album), Film Strip, Halftone (like an aged postcard), and Cartoon.Don't like what you just did? Tap the menu and hit ""Undo _____"" (one step undo available), or ""Revert to Original."" Or just Cancel the edit outright.Like what you just did? Save it. It will automatically save a copy so you don't have to worry about screwing up the original.Like it enough to share it? Share it in the above outlined method.If you got in here via the Camera, just tap on the back to Camera.StoryMaker: looks awesome. I haven't used it yet. Maybe I'll make one to torture the in-laws at the Holidays. Basically, you pick photos and or videos and music, and it mashes them all together in a pleasing manner - and you can edit specifics too.Browser: Nice and snappy. Built in sharing. Downloads are a breeze, and you select the destination folder and name right off the bat. Open links in new tabs. Copy link address. Share a page by just tapping ""Share."" ""Save Link As"" if you need to download something frompoorly coded websites. On that note, I have to say: if you find a website that doesn't work nicely, talk to the website. BB10 is FULLY HTML5 compliant. If the coders for the site you're looking at can't figure out how to be compliant with a worldwide standard, that's their fault.Bookmarks are managed via tags. I actually like that better than folders, but that's my opinion.Full Flash support. There is a YouTube app on the phone, but frankly it's kind of redundant what with the full Flash Support. Just go to the YouTube website. You're good.Security: Everyone has probably heard that not only has BlackBerry historically been the top for security. This is still true. I could launch into techno speak as to why, but I'll spare you that. For the daily home user, know this:You will have expected options like locking your phone with a password... or not. It's up to you. Set your default screen timeout as well as ""lock"" timeout.You have BlackBerry Protect built in. Lose your phone? Someone stole it? log on to BB Protect via the web and choose your path: Make your phone ring loudly and a lot. Make it display a message. Track it with the built in GPS. Worst case scenario: wipe it.BlackBerry Balance: if you're a Sysadmin, this is built for you. An employee will have two completely separate and compartmentalised profiles. One for work, where you can control anything you want, and when they go home at the end of the day, they log in to their personal profile and can use any apps they want look at adult websites for all you care.There is no crossover. None. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Company data stays where it belongs, and personal use does too.From your Home Screen, swipe down from the top to: Turn Bluetooth and WiFi on or off, lock/unlock screen rotation, access your alarm clock, bring up your notifications profile (normal, silent, etc.), or bring up the full settings interface.Organize your apps however you want. Make folders. Swipe to the right to see your active frames, and again from there to get to Hub (or as always, from anywhere you can swipe up to the middle then right to get to Hub).Maps: It just works. GPS. Voice Guidance. Avoid Highways, Toll Roads, etc. etc. Voice Search. It works nicely. I'm happy.Voice Control: Built in Voice Control to: make a call, send email, BBM, text, schedule an appointment, update FB Status, Tweet, LinkedIn... seriously please just go to the BlackBerry site and watch the videos. I will say it's not at 100% capabilities I had hoped for, mostly that it won't just tell me the weather. BUT, I have done all sorts of stuff with it (texting, email, searching, etc). Hold down the ""mute"" button on the right side of the device to activate voice control. Is it as good as the competitors? Maybe not, but darned close - and will presumably keep getting better.Screen/Display/Video quality. Gorgeous. Enough said.Battery Life: there were a lot of complaints when Z10 first came out. They may have been valid. 10.1 OS update fixed that, and I got the phone after that. I will say: when you install an app, go to ""Notifications"" then ""Other Apps"" in your Main Settings and make sure the darn app isn't constantly polling for updates. Just turn the stupid notifications off, unless you really really want it. Mine is set to only notify for FB and BB World. Also, this will not affect the Hub, so don't worry about turning notifications off.Secondly, when you get your phone, kill the battery fully then do a full recharge. This is standard for any phone. The battery has been sitting in a box for you don't know how long - days, months... just do this. It will help.Call quality. Excellent. No complaints. When you are on a call, if you take the phone away from your ear the and call screen automatically comes up so you can bring up the dial pad or tap for speaker phone. Speaker phone is really nice sound quality.***Bedside Mode and Alarm Clock*** If you are not a previous BB user, you may not know ""Bedside Mode."" Here's what you do when you go to bed: Bring up the clock either from the home screen app icon, or drag down the top menu from home screen and tap alarm(either works). Set your alarm - if you chose the analog clock, just drag the little blue button around the clock. Digital clock: tap where the alarm is displayed. Set accordingly. Then drag down from top bezel and tap Bedside Mode.-OR- if your phone is locked, just drag down from the top. You will automatically be in the Clock and Bedside Mode is automatically engaged.Bedside means all alerts are off. You can opt to have phone calls come through if you want (say if you're on call or something).Apps: I knew you were going to ask. To be completely honest, there isn't an app that I need/want that isn't available. I know, I know.... some of you want App X or App Y. Well, if it's that important to you, stick with another platform. Or... tell the App X to develop a BB10 app. Simple. BB10 apps are developed with programming languages any programmer worth their salt would know. So.... what's the problem?All in all, I'm actually really amazed.... that even with being a techno junkie I didn't know about even half of the awesome features of this phone that actually make a huge difference for day to day user experience... and...I love this phone. Love. Want to marry it. Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G (ok not that part). LOVE IT.Questions? Ask me. I'll try to get to them as time permits.Just try it. Seriously. Just try it.",2013年10月12日 在美国审核
Loving the underrated Z10.,"Despite the industry's worst new product marketing campaign, abysmal mobile carrier promotional support and ongoing bashing in the US media, the BlackBerry Z10 is an excellent mobile phone.And at today's prices it is practically a steal!The Z10 is built around a new mobile operating system, BB10.It is unlike any previous BlackBerry OS, but maintains the productivity focus BlackBerry users demand, while adding exciting full-touch and entertainment value like other popular ""glass slab"" mobile devices we've come to love.I won't go into the many things I love about my Z10.Other reviewers have covered it well enough.But, after using my Z10 for the past 6 months, I would like to add a few points of my own:1) BB10 It is not a wholesale Android or iOS rip-off.It is also very different from the track-pad interface-oriented OS of earlier BlackBerry devices.So, it will take some time to get use to some of the interface ""quirks"".Of course, BB10 borrows many common intuitive touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom.But adds some unique and useful gestures, like multi-finger swipe on the keypad for multi-word delete (Yes, the BB10 touch keypad is probably the best).The important gestures that quickly become intuitive are ""peek"" and ""flick"".Personally, I have come to miss them when I use my Android devices.2) Android Apps can be side-loaded to BB10 devices.As of BB10 10.1, This feature is still being refined, but it promises to become a forefront feature early next year when BB10 10.2.1 is officially released.(BB10 developers have access to this release today!)The key here is that you have access to the broad base of Android Apps without compromising the security and productivity focused features that BB10 offers.You'll be hearing more about this before long.As much as reviewers complain about the ""lack"" of BlackBerry Apps, many popular Android apps have been ported to BB10.Although less numerous than iOS or Android, the native BB10 apps are really nicely put together and BB10 developers are very ""hungry"" trying to make BB10 users happy.(They know there is an opportunity for growth as the BB10 user base grows.)3) Mobile carrier technical support personnel are not very familiar with the new BlackBerry BB10 operation system.And they have little incentive to change.So, you will have to rely on online user groups (CrackBerryDOTcom and N4BBdotCOM are good starting places.)Unfortunately, getting support form BlackBerry directly is ""challenging"" since they will request that you first try working with your carrier... (I think this is one of BlackBerry's weaknesses right now... carriers have more incentive to support Android and iOS, but BlackBerry won't even try to ""go it alone"" as far as tech support.(Maybe they can't for legal/contractual reasons.))4) Many corporate IT personnel are not familiar with BB10 and how it is different from previous BlackBerry OS versions.Ironically, if they use an older version of BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), they may not even think your BB10 device can access corporate email without upgrading to BES 10.But, rest assured, if Android and iOS devices can access corporate ""push"" email, so can BB10.This is because BB10 BlackBerry devices no longer require the BES for corporate email.Instead, BB10 devices now use the same ActiveSync technology used for Android (and iOS) devices.My experience was with my employer's Lotus Notes system and the setup procedure was practically the same as for Android.(I found a great how-to write-up online.)So don't let confused (or ill-informed) IT personnel to discourage you from getting the most from the Z10.5) This is no longer a problem, but it is worth mentioning.Since new owners may run into this too.There have been 3rd party radio firmware problems on some phones.As a result, many of us (myself included) experienced random reboots with my Z10 (AT&amp;T STL100-3) while AT&amp;T was powerless to fix it.I am very happy to report, that this problem is now fixed with BB10 release 10.1.So, if/when you get your phone, be sure to check for updates.(Updating software is pretty easy once they are available through the carrier.There are ways to install secure and stable ""leaked"" versions (i.e. developer releases)But, it is not recommended for those who are not technically savvy.)The bottom line is that in the Z10 BlackBerry demonstrates a promising and exciting mobile software platform with a solid hardware platform.If you loved BlackBerry devices in the past, but moved to newer full-touch devices for modern experience, I think it is worth trying the new BB10 devices.(Especially now when carriers are practically giving them away.)",2013年11月25日 在美国审核
The BEST phone that NOBODY else has!,"Comparable in performance to a $700 iPhone, but you can own it unlocked for under $250. Pros: Bulletproof, secure OS, perfect for banking, shopping or taking naked selfies, crazy-fast browser, and ability to type fast and accurate with one thumb. Downsides? Battery life is average, but not what you'd expect from a Blackberry. Apps? What you would use 90% of rhe time comes with the phone, and 1mobilemarket has everything else. The next OS update will have an advanced Android emulator and Amazon apps will open up your options.Several of my friends have switched to the Z10 and love it. Once you master the gestures, (there is no home button) you'll be able to do 4 things before your iphone buddy can get past the lock screen. The ergonomics are very well thought out.Also, cases, chargers and screen protectors are Ramen Noodles cheap.",2014年9月6日 在美国审核
Android Fan now a BlackBerry Fan,"I was worried about buying a brand spanking new device without it being put through it's trials. But I read about how several governments were already adopting the Z10 as the only phone secure enough for their use. I heard about how a police agency in Georgia uses blackberry OS for it's police paperwork and database access.Sounded well vouched for to me, and I wasn't wrong.As an android user who really only wanted a phone with a calendar, my first concern was google calendar. My answer is yes, it can and does currently sync *witout problems* to my Z10. It wasn't as easy as other calendars, but all it required was manually putting in Google's settings for CalDAV and a few tries and Voila! I can read and write to my google calendar easy as pie. Or cake.Now I was told as I was buying the phone ""I hope you're ready for all the gesture based interactions!""...All modern mobile devices use some form of swiping to get you places in the phone. The Z10 just uses them better. Swipeing to use the BlackBerry hub is awesome, and it works just as well as other similar social agregators I've seen on android phones. Also, being able to peak at the unread items in the hub while using an app is plenty cool. It doesn't say who's a text is from, or what facebook activity just occured, but you know it happened. Worse comes to worst, just play with the tutorials like I did until you understand how to use the gestures. Remember, always RTFM.I don't like using a million and one apps. I use my phone as a phone, calendar, and quick look up device. That being said, there are stil many quality apps on the BB market, but not to the levels that iOS and Android have. I have unfortunately run into one or two apps that need trouble shooting, but that just needs some time.The hardware is sweet. It has yet to freeze up on me even when running 4 or 5 apps at once. I haven't tried stress testing it, but when I was running a graphics intensive game, it did get pretty warm with no drop in performance. The camera takes photos that look great, or just as good as any iPhone photo I've seen. Video is just as nice.Now, I do have a few issues with it.My first problem was with the password protection. No recovery options. 10/10 tries are used up, the phone shreds all it's contents. I *really* should have remembered my password. Lost some nice photos of a train derailment.I don't use all of BlackBerry specific communications methods (BBM, BBM video, PIN messaging), because I don't anyone with a blackberry. Simple, and not really an issue.It appears blackberry Balence (a system that allows two different home screens, one work, one personal that can be password protected) can only be activated via a blackberry server and not by a single, at home, user. I don't need it, but it would be nice to have the option.All the default ringtones sound the same. Seriously. They are all 1,2, or 3 ""ding"" tones with varying pitches. You can easily pick any audio file as a ring tone, txt tone, or e-mail tone, but as it stands, I never know what kind of message just showed up on my phone. This is after a month of use.The cost. This phone appears to be a very much like the best iPhones out the, but with no web browsing issues, more business oriented, and more security. So given all that the price is comparable, but my phone was $531 new from T-Mobile. Damn. That's like...two phones.All in all the Z10 is awesome. A sleek, versitile, powerhouse of a phone that doesn't break down, get infected (as of yet), or have too many bells and whisles that the basics were neglected.",2013年7月18日 在美国审核

"Despite BBRY issues, still prefer Z10 to iPhone 5 w iOS7","Management of BBRY has disappointed on so many fronts marketing these devices, then announcing ""sale"" with no evidence that such announcement was needed and scaring off customers. Having used RIM/BBRY devices side by side with iOS devices for years, can say that there is more of a learning curve with the Z10 and BB10 OS, but I still prefer BB10 OS/Z10 as my main communication tool, strongly prefer to iOS. Main benefits of the Z10 are Hub, which pulls all incoming communications into one spot (you can see, delete from multiple accounts, eg email, Twitter, LinkedIn, text, voice mail, Microsoft 365, update notifications for updated apps, calls in/out, etc) without having to press a button for different apps; intuitive typing is light years ahead of iOS (including iOS7, which I installed yesterday); multitasking far easier with swipes not constantly pressing home button. A few weeks ago my Z10 needed to be exchanged and I returned to iOS as primary communication tool. It worked, but far, far happier with restored Z10 back in hand.Z10 and BBRY far short on apps, however.If communication is not primary tool for phone, and apps are a major interest, then iOS likely the better choice for you despite having to use home button to switch apps and other limitations. Having &gt; 150 apps, I can say apps are nice, ultimately only a few truly used with great frequency. For many these few convenience apps are worth iOS limitations (virtual keyboard, app switching, etc). The new iOS has an updated look, but difference is stylistic, not a major functional change.Whether one upgrades for fingerprint scanner for security is personal choice/convenience issues, as one can still type in a security code to access device. Only major improvement I can see in iOS7 thus far, and truly helpful, is that one can open more than 8 browser windows at a time. A disadvantage of iOS7 is that folders are now limited to 9 apps before one has to page through to second screen; on Z10 each folder will hold 16 apps.If communication using multiple different accounts (as noted above) are important and you don't like switching from app to app, then Z10 is better option. Uncertainty of company's direction is unsettling. Personally I avoid Android due to malware risk.Much talk about BBRY going way of Palm. As a former Palm user, I gave up on device as lagging and no longer useful long before it bottomed. Sad thing with BBRY is that Z10, plethora of apps aside, is really a joy to use c/w iOS.",2013年9月21日 在美国审核
Best phone I've ever had,"I'm using Z10 more than half a year now. This phone is perfect, no other word for it. Quick, fluid, intuitive interface. Predictive (and adaptive) input is brilliant (I am using it with multiple languages). Real multitasking. Working with big files (presentations, spread sheets) - fast and flawless. Screen size and resolution - spot on! Camera - just right. Need better resolution and quality for your pictures? buy a digital SLR :)Shortly after writing this comment, I was out with my family for a weekend without my PC or pad. I had unexpected urgent tasks from the office, including an excel spreadsheet and a presentation. This phone was my only tool to get the job done quickly. I was using e-mail, cloud file storage etc etc. I did everything easily and quickly. Thank you Blackberry. Really wish this company to recover and continue making really smart tools for really busy people.",2013年10月11日 在美国审核
"Love my Z10, but be careful when ordering!","I use the white Z10 that is identical to this listing. However, I noticed in the pictures used for this listing that the phone is for Verizon? Verizon does not use the GSM band, they have a CDMA network, so I don't know how this would be possible. Other reviewers have stated that there are different model numbers i.e. 100-1, 100-2, 100-3, etc. so I won't elaborate on that. However, it is great council to watch the model number when ordering as well as ensuring the phone is GSM so you can use it on GSM networks like AT&amp;T and other low-cost prepaid companies who use GSM.Note: I purchased my GSM Z10 to run on StraightTalk and have to unlock the developer side of the phone in order to get it to save the StraightTalk network as my data provider. (There are many articles about APN setting difficulties for StraightTalk SIM cards used in these phones. However, it was an easy work around. Had I used the phone on AT&amp;T or other providers, I wouldn't have had to do this extra step.)",2013年12月26日 在美国审核
Amazing phone,"NOTE: I did NOT purchase this phone on Amazon, but it's such a good product that I wanted to give my input for potential buyers.I may be partial to BlackBerry phones because my previous smartphones have all been BlackBerrys but this phone is ahead of the curve. (That was sort of a BB pun...) This is the BBZ10 STL100-3, with 4G ready and the QualComm Snapdragon S4 Plus dual-core 1.5Ghz Processor.Battery life:If I *had* to complain this is where I would do it. The battery life is not legendary. It's about what you would expect from a smartphone. I charge it everyday and it works the whole day but don't expect much more than that. In this day and age where every smartphone has multi-core processors, 5 different radios, push email etc. I think a whole day's worth of battery life is what you can expect. If you're answering emails all day or gaming or surfing the web, battery life will suffer but you can always buy an extended pack, one of the accessories BlackBerry sells.Call quality:Call quality is fantastic. The new 10.2 software upgrade comes with natural sound technology. And I have to say that it sounds superb. Voices are full and rich. This phone has also never dropped a call in the 6 months I've had it. (The iPhone has dropped at least 3.) Video call quality is also good. The front facing cameraExperience:The swipe interface is amazing. Whoever said that it has a ""steep learning curve"" is obviously a moron. There's only three gestures that you ever have to use and if you can't handle that then maybe a touchscreen phone isn't for you anyway. Programs are fast and responsive and it's NEVER frozen. I have also never rebooted the phone because its gotten slow or lagged. I've never used the Mini-HDMI output so I have nothing to say there.Email:As the original push-service email device, the BlackBerry still holds ground as the best workhorse phone for email. My BlackBerry gets email faster than my computer EVERY TIME. With Priority Hub on the new 10.2 OS, the phone also learns which contacts and conversations are important (read: not ads) and pushes them up to the top of the Hub so you get your important emails quickly.Storage:You can use the device as a NAS through an encrypted WiFi connection. This is STANDARD and integrated on the BBZ10 platform. It seemlessly integrates with several cloud based services too including Box, DropBox and Skydrive. It also accepts a 64Gb Micro-SDXC card so its tough to run out of space too.Build quality:The phone is well built, feels hefty and substantial but isn't heavy and is EXTREMELY thin (.36 inches to be exact).Display:The display is clear and beautiful and with a 356 ppi resolution, it's sharper than the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. It's also 4.2 inches diagonal where the iPhone is only 4 inches. But I mean...some people say size doesn't matter.Overall:This is really a fantastic phone. I've run phones with Android and tested iPhones (dark days) before and I think that the BlackBerry really gets down to what you use a phone for. Messaging, taking and placing phone calls, updating social networks, email and browsing the web while your girlfriend is shopping for clothes. It's not app-hungry, which could be a downside to some users. But for the most part it does the job, does it well, is fast, responsive, looks and feels like it means business, keeps you connected and lasts all day, take a look at the BlackBerry Z10. But be warned, you might never go back to another brand.",2014年1月6日 在美国审核
I KNEW THEY COULD DO IT!!,"I have been a loyal Blackberry phone user for many years .

I simply move around keeping it open to look at something else. Spell check rocks! In time, the phone ""learns"" your language and keeps it stored for later use.

winner -Z10,"I was on the fence on which phone to upgrade to. My three options were an iphone5, Samsung Galaxy S4, or the Blackberry Z10. I can't type as well (since I have nails) on the iphone in fact that phone was the worse one. I don't really like the idea that everything you download to it has to come directly from Apple either. My husband has already been through two phones with the same issue of the handset not working properly when you are making phone calls and when I was in the ATT Phone store a customer came in with problems with there iphone so that is out, the Samsung was better to type on but after reading reviews on it there seem to be a lot of people who had problems with Bluetooth and with the phone cracking when dropped. I can type amazing on the Z10 it is very user friendly and everything I want in the way of apps have been available, in addition if there is not an app then it is on the web. The browser is extremely fast and the call quality is excellent Very happy with my purchase after taking months to research and many visits to the ATT stores to try out different phones.

BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 5 !!!,"I came from a IPhone 5 due to it being very boring and basic. Apple has had the same look for years and then they came out with the new IOS 7.

I have had a BlackBerry Tour in the past so I thought it would be a giant step in the right direction to the right phone. I thought right! It is everything I was looking for and much more!!! I daily find new features everyday! The expandable memory, keyboard that works to YOUR texting style, you name it! And best of all, there are downloadable themes!

Period.,"Have to agree, this is the best phone I've owned and I've owned almost everything.Fast, real multitasking, best security out there.I have the T-Mo USA version which also has wifi-calling (Apple won't allow on their T-mo phones... of course, because it would make their clunky Viber obsolete).The form factor is also excellent -- big enough to act as a tablet, small enough to still be a phone.Also, best screen ever for bright daylight viewing.Replaceable battery, memory media that can be changed or upgraded... phone gets a bad rap from the deeply stupid reviewers who have become iPhone zombies.",2013年12月11日 在美国审核
A very good cell phone.,"I've bought this device (on april, 14th) as a replacement for my BB Torch 2. I tested Iphone 4 and 5, and some Samsung Galaxy and Motorola Razr devices, but none of them really liked me.I had to admit that I do not like the Samsung quality and the sensation of this phone in my hands. For my humble point of view, I never get friendly with the Android's interface. Among the many cell phones that I used, I always missed the Palm Treo, your rock solid design, and GUI.I work like a patent engineering in electric field. I spent many hours per week researching tech info, so to make up my mind, I did a research and I came across that this BB could be a very good option besides many negatives reviews.Virtual keyboard:I really hesitate to replace because I love the Torch's keyboard, but after few hours of use the Z10, the virtual keyboard I realize that the virtual keyboard it's outstanding. The predictive option it is very good. It helps so much because predicts the following word in mostly cases. I do not consider the BB Q10 (it has a physical keyboard) because I was looking for a bigger screen.Battery life:I read in a post that if I run an app and closed it after used it, the battery life improve, because this background task was killed. I did it and I get more than 14 hs.Made Quality:It has been well designed and constructed, the size it is very good, and I have the sensation that I have a very good piece of engineering in my hand, not a toy.Ecosystem:Many apps that I use it weren't developed to BB already, but after downloaded the Amazon App, I could installed and run it like a breeze.BB gesture:It's taking a time to get familiar with, but after this it's so easy to use it.BB OS 10:I really like the stability, until now after installed almost 20 apps, the Z10 never hang it or showed weird error's'pop up sign.BB Hub.It is a simple but very effective app that concentrates the main incomings notification that the user received. It's very useful and very addictive.BB headphones:Far away in terms of quality from the previous top models. There are fair but not outstanding. I missed the noise cancelling ear silicone.Quality of In/Out calls:I really impressed because sometimes I have to set the volume down to get more comfort. I can talk and listen without any problem.Copy and paste:In the BB Torch, it was a nightmare to do it every time I need it. In OS 10, BB Engineers solved this issue and it's simple and intuitive as it has to be.Cradle:I really missed the BB Torch's cradle to charge it and use the cell phone like a clock. Actually BB does not design anyone. Thirds party suppliers offer some option but I did not buy anyone of this.Holster:It comes with anyone. I had to buy to protect it.Camera:.I am a photo enthusiast, using everyday a DSLR, so any cell phone never gives me what I looking for. It is fair for occasional photos.GUI (Graphical user interface)It's clean with very good icon's design. It is possible to make folders and gathers icons.HDMI mini port:I hadn't tried this yet. I don't have the cable. It's possible to hooking up a cable and broadcast any movie from the BB to the TV.Update:After 3 weeks of using it, one morning at home I went to my bathroom and absent mindedly I dropped the cell phone into the toilet. Few seconds before I took a piss. I took it out immediately, took the battery out, cleaned it and put it 24 hs into rice. After this I dissembled and cleaned all the circuits. The Z10 came from death and now I am using with out any problem. Here in argentina the regular price is 500 dolars with contract plan in any carrier, I thought that I had to buy it again!",2014年5月4日 在美国审核
Absolutely amazing,"I love technology and things that are beautiful. The Z10 is technologically ahead of others and it looks drop dead sexy. The typing experience is amazing. I now enjoy typing emails with it and even some simple work documents, which was virtually impossible with my iPhone. I now can type emails with using just one hand. The hub is always available in the background and only one swipe away, whichis a time saver. Voice phone calls sounds great, better than iPhone. The camera allows you to adjust the image so you will never have to worry about closed eyes again, just snap and then adjust each person's face to reveal their best post. The Web browser is super fast and smooth, faster than my desktop computer. The size and shape of the phone fits my hand comfortably, both when using one hand and two. The material also feels good to the touch.I rarely write product reviews such as this, but this phone is so good that felt compelled to write this review. This is truly an amazing phone.",2013年3月26日 在美国审核
Best BB ever,"I was using an iPhone 5 for several months and before that i was using an iPhone 4. I noticed that there was some news about BlackBerry and the company running into losses. I decided to try the Z10 myself. Its been about a month since I am using this. And I am beginning to get addicted to it now.. If I compare this phone to an iPhone, here are the things I found.Body Styling - DrawComfort while held in hands - Z10Touch sensitivity and smoothness - iPhone 5 (only by a margin)App Support - iPhone (But the most common and important apps are available on BB world)BBM vs iMessage - BBM (thats a no brainer)Keyboard - Z10 blows away every other touch screen phone in the market.Overall, it definitely feels and looks more professional. I am not sure why its not doing well in US.. Agreed that this model came in a little too late, but its very well worth the wait.. For the iPhone, Apple's aggressive marketing and US media hype works in their favor big time....",2013年10月28日 在美国审核
Absolutely Awesome!,"I'm not going to write about how good this phone is, but rather share my experiences with other phones:Starting with the iPhone, I had been an iPhone user since inception up until the release of Galaxy SIII. I switched to the Galaxy because I felt like the iPhone was exactly the same phone every year despite me buying a new model every year. Literally, the same phone, I bought the new iPhone every year hoping something 'cool' was added, but nothing, same look and feel.I went from the iPhone to the Galaxy SIII because I had heard great things about Android. Sure enough, I enjoyed the phone, though not as slick as the iPhone, the Android Operating System was a refreshing experience. This honeymoon lasted about one month, and then couldn't stand the phone. The battery drain was just too much, then people told me, root it!!! That's the way to go! Samsung's TouchWiz interface is a battery killer and is clunky. Okay. I rooted the phone and installed basic Google apps. Okay battery life did greatly improve and I was happy again. Until I realized that I had installed a ROM that was supported by a Community of brilliant people, I must say, but I was a BETA tester!!! I couldn't take the crashes, and basic functionality bugs... So I went back to the iPhone because even though I was sick of it, it at least lasted me half the day.I bought the BlackBerry Z10 and haven't looked back, I haven't been this excited about a phone since the first iPhone, when I switched from a Nokia. It was night and day, and that's how I feel right now. Going from Galaxy and iPhone to a BlackBerry is literally night and day. Incredible battery life (up to a day and a half of intensive use before a charge), true multi tasking.. this is truly amazing. I remember when the Apple introduced the multi app function, but was it really multi tasking? Clearly not, currently you cannot go to Youtube, listen your your favorite mix and reply to a text, or go to Facebook. The minute you leave YouTube, the music stops... That's not the case in the Z10, you can navigate the entire phone, open any app, and the music/video is still playing. True multitasking.Awesome phone, really powerful operating system. Incredible response to touch, so fast and responsive. A++++++",2013年3月26日 在美国审核
Early adopter with long term use very satisfied with BlackBerry Z10,"I bought the BlackBerry Z10 having used both android and apple products. Having owned BlackBerry phones for a number of years with a key board, I was concerned that a person with large hands like myself may have difficulty with the virtual keyboard. The suggestive interface created by the BlackBerry team actually increased my texting and typing speeds!I was also concerned about the smaller number of apps available but when the ability to side-load and later formally purchase and run android apps was granted through my carrier I could not have been more pleased.This phone has gone everywhere with me running both business applications and all other types.The construction is like most BlackBerry products very solid. In my experience, no one I know of has ever experienced a device failure due to bending.The device is fast and has adequate battery storage which is the one area that could stand improvement. The organization of the software using QNX is better than most. BlackBerry needed a phone of this level to make a come back Recent software upgrades to personal assistant are terrific!Try this device and you will likely be very glad you did.",2014年11月8日 在美国审核
Overall a great phone,"A coworker was looking at my phone today and we got to talking about it.I have had it for about 2 weeks now, and realized I really love this phone.I have been an Android user for the last few years.I left my old blackberry behind because it just felt old and outdated.I enjoyed android, but it was always a little buggy.I had to restart the phone every day or two or it would get laggy.The Z10 is fast and responsive.It works great.I haven't taken the time to really get to know the keyboard, but I do notice that it fixes more of my mistakes than the Android keyboard did.I can just type haphazardly away and then when I go back and read my message, most of the time it is 100% accurate.I also use voice controls quite a bit, and for the most part it works very well.I would like to see more features in the future, but it does all the things I really need it to do.I had serious battery drain issues at first, but I made 3 tweaks and now I get through the day without dipping below about 60% battery life:1. Settings - Network Connections - Mobile Networks.Changed Network Technology to LTE instead of Global.2. Settings - Display.Allow Gestures when locked to OFF.This is a tradeoff because it's pretty cool to just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to wake up the phone.But I don't mind pushing the on button instead.This is supposed to save a little battery life.3. Settings - Security and Privacy - Encryption.OFF.I read somewhere that this helps the battery life.I don't know how important it is to have the encryption.Maybe I should turn it back on.But I'm not really that important, and after doing all 3 of these things, I am getting great battery life.My wife is not a techy person, she just wants her stuff to work.I was a little worried that she wouldn't like the phone, but so far she is really liking it.She would like Pinterest and Instagram apps.Not currently available, so that is a bummer.We both went in with the attitude that we had 14 days to try them out, so we would send them back if we didn't like them.Well, we like these phones.We are keeping them.",2013年4月12日 在美国审核
I didnt buy from this seller but love this phone,"I have to say this phone is a breath of fresh air from the Androids Ive been used to. The gestures are easy to learn. took me about 2 hours to really get a good handle on it. Always looking for the back button at first. The hub is just nice. Every thing works slick on this phone. Browsing is great and the option to run flash is there or you can turn it off. I bought mine off contract to use on Verizon from a Verizon employee. I had to go to crackberry to get a leaked OS to be able to load android apps without side loading. Of the 4-5 i loaded all but one works right. BBM is great, never messed with it before, but use it to communicate with my kids when they are with their mother. Yes I call them too lol. They use it on an Android phone and an Ipad and message speed is just blazing fast, and I can talk to them both at the same time. It uses data but when you use it on wifi that is no issue. The external speaker is great. Better than any android I ever had. Call quality is crystal clear. Battery is about as good as most smartphones. Nothing special. Reception on this phone beats my droid hands down. It isnt perfect but still really good. Texting on this thing is so nice compared to android. It is really hard to mess up. Voice to text works really well for me. Better than another reviewer said it did for them. I have a midwestern accent as well. Hasnt put a word in wrong for me yet.Overall, if the phone holds up, and BB keeps making them like this, I will never own anything but BB from now on. This is my first BB by the way. Always androids before.",2014年1月20日 在美国审核
This seller is a scam and a disgrace,"This seller does not include whether which model the blackberry z10 is. There are 5 different models. They differ greatly, some have LTE, some cannot be used with certain carriers, and some are for different countries. It's a mess, and it's a disgrace to see this seller not including the model number they sell.Do not buy from this seller, amazon should ban this seller. Marking every model as a ""LTE"" capable phone is a blatant lie. And, good luck figuring whether or not the phone you recieve will work for your carrier, since you have no idea which model you are getting.What a scam.I cannot say how stupid people are by still buying from this seller. You do not know which model you are getting, the seller will not tell you, to buy this phone from this seller and expect it to work 100% is taking a HUGE gamble. By from a source that tells you the model number e.g. stl-1003. Btw, stl-1003 phones are AT&amp;T compatible.***As to the actual review of the phone, 5 out of 5 stars!:Before the great days of the smart phone, apple was the first in the western world to introduce a new phone that would change the way we use phones today. It's locked own OS and locked own features have caused people later on to create the android OS which is much more free and less constrained by rules of the manufacturer, allowing people to customize it greatly and and manufacturers to create unique devices that would differ greatly from company to company but allow it to be all under once flag, the android flag.Obviously, being the free and open minded person I opted android, where I found freedom to be plenty. Custom roms, rooting, and other features lured me into an android world full of possibilities.I slowly watched as my 8 month old android phone become archaic and urged myself to go forth and by the newest and best android phones every 6 months, becoming a victim of this intelligent marketing scheme. With each newest phone offering the best specs, the best software, and best hardware quality I was eager to treat myself with such.Oh but then I saw through this. I realized that with each newest phone upgrade, the differences between the past models were unnoticeable based on speed. Galaxy S3 versus S4, no one would notice the difference between the speed. Oh, but you can say you have those nifty benchmark speeds, which would greatly be able to see the difference through digits. Oh, but I say in return, those numbers don't mean squat, since the hardware difference will always be too small to noticeably feel it with each next concurrent model of the android phone. Thus, by telling yourself the phone will be faster based on just a benchmark score would be like me judging a book by its cover. It's not enough to have a accurate assumption, and may fall to give one a misguided perception.Then I realized, optimization is key to a fast phone. What does optimization mean? Well first look into the computing aspects of a phone. There is two sides, software and hardware. Just because you have the latest hardware, doesn't mean your phone would be the fastest. Just because your benchmark score is super high, doesn't mean your phone performance will be. What is just as important if not more is the software side of things. Android is supposed to run on hundreds of different phones from different companies, thus, the software is not optimized as compared to a company that codes its own OS in relation to its own hardware. Wait, wait, wait a sec, isn't that what BLACKBERRY and APPLE do? Yes quite certainly, thus, you can see how apple phones and blackberry phones last MUCH longer than those ""premium"" android handsets since there is too much competition among android phone makers, who try to pump the best every 6 months only to forget and leave in the dust it's older phones.But companies like blackberry and apple only create one line of products, which they control the OS to. Thus, they are more careful about the full utilization of software for its hardware, unlike android.Thus, with this phone, I realized how fast it is, even with its one year old dated hardware, it still runs as fast as the newest android phone, because the company cares and has complete control over it's OS, so that it can be optimized the high extent. Can android phones be opitimized as much as a blackberry? No, it is such a broadly used OS, it will never be able to.Now to the actual OS, this phone is flying with speed. It has the core functions of a phone: calling, texting, email and social media all integrated into the OS. They call it the hub, I see it as genius. It is simply where you will be spending most of your time in regardes to communication, which is only 2 swipes away from any screen. This makes checking anything amazingly easy and fast. You can install android apps, which closes pretty much the ""app gap"" people compain about. It has the screen you expect from a high end device as well.All the little things, like the alarm app, compass app, and other default apps are beautifully and smartly designed. They seem to be designed in a way so that you would actually see yourself using them, unlike android where every default app made by samsung is crap and I always turn to 3rd party apps from the store to take care of that. Not Blackberry, everything I need is in the phone by default, since so much care was put into those default apps.Is this phone less constrained by rules than android? No, blackberry made security important feature, thus it is not as open as android. But, it is more open and less rule governed than the IOS, where you can't even view your phone as a USB Device without the use of a 3rd party software.Transferring files? I will never need my USB cable again. How you must scream! Easy, all I did was set up blackberry link on my PC and I have access to my blackberry as a ""networked hard drive"" whenever it's connected to the internet. Damn, that's nifty blackberry. Oh sure, you might say, well android can do that, but I would say, still though, you would only be able to do that through 3rd party apps. I can do that by default on my device. Why should I care? Well for one, I know it's a secured and reliable way, I don't need to depend on a third party company, I only need to depend on blackberry to make the best out of my phone.Smart phone that actually thinks the way you would. Seriously, they should make that their logo if they can because the major thing I noticed about this phone is how much it makes sense logically.Minor gripe, the battery life will last you 6 hours on heavy use and 10 hours on moderate use. That's why I bought the extended battery charger from blackberry, which is a minor annoyance to carry around everywhere.",2014年5月15日 在美国审核
All I can say is WOW!,"I have been using my Z10 for over a month, and all I can say is, ""Wow!""It just gets better and better as you figure out more and more things you can do with the device.It saves me at least a few minutes a day and allows me to get a lot more accomplished.If it saves me three minutes a day due to faster typing, true multitasking, more integrated apps, that comes out to over a thousand minutes a year.I don't know about you, but as a professional, those thousand minutes are valuable to me, representing almost two full work days.Oh, and there are apps aplenty, despite what you may have heard.The only ones that are lacking are not particularly useful to me.The online banking apps are coming but not really necessary since the browser is so blazingly fast.So if you want a toy and can't figure out how to use the inline editor and built-in sharing tools to share your pictures, go ahead and get an iToy because it has Instagram.If you want a truly amazing piece of technology that will make your life easier and more enjoyable, get the Z.Youwill not regret it.PS - after using this phone, it's clear that anyone who gives it a one-star review has not used it.Even an app junkie will have to admit that it's an amazing OS, that the keyboard is phenomenal, etc.But whatever.Haters are gonna hate.Winners just keep winning. :)",2013年4月21日 在美国审核

Best phone I've ever purchased. Period!,"I can't for the life of me understand why Blackberry has struggled so much and can't seem to sell these BB Z10 phones, taking a write down of almost $1 Billion on this phone in particular. I LOVE my Z10! It's lightning fast with the Snapdragon processor; the HUB is FANTASTIC! It's like my personal assistant in a virtual office, alerting me when texts, e-mails and anything else of importance need my immediate attention. I've synced all my e-mails to the phone, I added my Twitter account, linkedIn, etc. and that beautiful red light (the one EVERY BB owner knows about and loves to see blinking) tells me when the phone must be picked up. Screen size is great for watching movies but I must say, there's a learning curve in understanding how this phone works, with it's swipe ups and downs, sideways swipes and getting a feel for how it all meshes together. People have gotten lazy and want their phones to be simple. Some of us are cerebral enough that we want a challenging phone to intrigue us. If you don't have time to learn how your phone works, then don't buy the Z10. I for one have no problem with using my God-given brains. They atrophy quite fast when not in use, you know? :)Phone has enough apps to make me happy for now. I'll be good to go when they add native apps for Amazon videos, Netflix, Hulu and Dramafever. I'm not CRAZY about apps that want to know every darn bit of information about you including your blood type, last person you dated and the size of your knickers. The Z10 allows you to put a bloody leash on these apps and deny them access to your location, serial and pin number and God-knows what else. Seriously, when an app is ostensibly ""FREE"", it really ain't if they're accessing all your personal information to mine for nefarious purposes. Okay, enough of my rant on apps. Needless to say, I keep my apps to a bare minimum and will delete any that demand to know my location, identifying information and pin # in order to work. That's why I hate whatsapp so much, even as I'm forced to use it. On the BB Z10, I'm able to put a muzzle on whatsapp's nosiness and still make it work. Couldn't do it on my last BB phone 'cos whatsapp refused to work until I gave up my whole resume.Back to the phone. Did I mention that I love it? Yes indeedy! I'm not interested in EVER purchasing a phone whose battery can't be removed by the end user. That's why you'll NEVER see me with an iPhone or the new BB Z30. Why Blackberry??? Who came up with that bright idea to make the battery on the Z30 non-removable? I'm seriously pissed about that; and bummed! Which reminds me, the Z10's battery life needs someimprovement. With the way I'm using it, my phone needs to be charged 2x a day but not for long thank God. I know the apps drain battery life but this area of the Z10 can be improved upon.The virtual keyboard is excellent! Very intuitive! It remembers what I type, including weird names and surnames and immediately proffers it again when I type another time. It has the Dropbox app already on the phone and I've synced it. Which means I have access to massive amounts of my Jazz and Classical music that I can use as ring tones any time and change at whim.

First BlackBerry,"This is my first BlackBerry ever. Gave up my iPhone 4s. Discovered that Verizon techs don't know squat about the BlackBerry system and could not transfer my data ( why are they selling a product they can't service?). Not a hit on this phone at all.

Z10 SETS THE NEW STANDARD IN A PHONE,"Wow, where do I start?As a previous owner of an iphone 4s, I was not entirely sure what to expect from BlackBerry's Z10 and their new BB10 operating system other than what I read online. Admittedly, I am a former BlackBerry Curve owner who eventually bailed on the platform for a then new Iphone 3gs paying early termination fees for not just one but two lines. I initially left seeking what everyone else was at the time - a better experience.Iphone was everything I was looking for. Siri and 4s, even better. Android started to catch my attention and I eventually went on a Sprint trial with an Evo 3d. What a POS. To this day I'm not sure if it was the sheer weight of that phone, Sprint or the Android experience, but I returned it within 30 days and went back to the Iphone.Enough about memory lane. Let's talk about the Z10!GesturesImmediately users will find themselves feeling somewhat lost, missing their home buttons to press to get started. Even my 2 year old son knows that on the Iphone if he gets lost, push the button to bail and start over. Z10, the marketing will tell you it's built to keep you moving.What's more appropriate would be ""Built to keep you from bailing"".Unlock the phone? Swipe the screen from the bottom up. Icons at the bottom service everyday functions, phone, search and camera, and showing you which apps are running.From there you swipe left or right depending on where you want to go.Left takes you into your messaging which let's you see everything (a.k.a the hub) or filter messages by app (Facebook messages, twitter activity, email, text messages, etc). Right takes you to a familiar tiling of your apps similar to Android and Iphone.On the side, there is a button between the volume controls that launches the voice controls. You can do Sri like commands such as textting or calling people, reminding you, schedule meetings, tweet, status update, you name it.App StoreThe essentials are on the phone such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, FourSquare, Dropbox, Evernote, etc.. I did some research and found the holy grail: side-loadingThe genius people at BlackBerry have allowed developers to speed up adoption of the platform by porting over their Android apps in a few clicks. There's even websites that let you upload an android app and immediately download it converted for BlackBerry. It's not 100% foolproof but I'm now back in business with essential apps - Pandora, Netflix, Plex, Google Maps, Skype to name a few.I see this as a short term compromise that will be unnecessary midyear when BlackBerry shocks everyone on success of the platform and competition forces people to target releases on the platform.As a developer, you have SOOOO many paths to launch an application in Java (Android ports), Native C++, HTML5, you name it.One year from now (at most), there will be a huge surge and Blackberry will be on top in sheer app count.You can take that to the bank.$BBRYTyping / KeyboardOne of the most overlooked area of innovation in the last couple of years has been typing. It is only fitting that BlackBerry comes along and turns this into one of the biggest differentiators between this platform and anything else out there.As you type, suggestions pop up over the letters. You can complete the word by simply `flicking' the letter upwards. Before long I found myself typing whole sentences with a few letters followed by some consecutive flicks. (in fact, I wrote most of this whole article on my z10, that's how natural it is.)All of a sudden, I'm not feeling sad anymore I don't have the 200,000 free games that bait you to buy the 200,000 paid version of them. The typing alone is a huge plus and top of list feature. Simply put, it's the new standard.CameraThe camera is pretty standard but comes with two unique features. One is the ability to take photos and fine tune individuals faces. Took that family portrait to find out half of the fam has their eyes shut? No problem with the Z10! The phone essentially takes frame samples like a video and allows you to cycle through the frames. When you are done its blended into the pictures and voilà! The perfect picture.You may have heard some buzz about Instagram not being available. What people don't know is you don't need it. There is a built in picture editor that allows you to tweak your pictures, such as applying image filters like Instagram. Pretty cool and another top of list feature.The Red LightWhat the heck am I talking about now you might ask. For die hard BlackBerry users, the visual indicator (red light) meant you had a new message. It would keep intermittently blink until you've read the message. I didn't initially notice it in my first run with the phone but I'm excited to announce IT'S BACK! However now, it spans any notification in my hub. Response to my Facebook status? Blink! Someone replied to my tweet? Blink! So what? Well what was even more equally satisfying was letting my phone sit by itself on my coffee table. I didn't have to pick it up, opening and closing apps to check for activity because I already knew. It wasn't blinking. For me, another top of list feature. I already feel like I'm saving time and being more productive on and off the phone.So far after 24 hours on the new device, I am in love again with my CrackBerry.",2013年4月1日 在美国审核
"The only things you want to know, and nothing else.","Having used the phone for a while, I have decided to write a review and I am going to be informative. I am going to divide my review for two kinds of users - A) Gadget enthusiasts with minimal business usage and 2) Strictly heavy business users.Kind A) For gadget enthusiasts with minimal business usage: Overall rating 2/5Pros:AP1) It's something new and different than iOS and Android, and I know enthusiasts get quickly bored, so this may just serve to be your new little toy to fiddle with. (Hint - it won't last nearly as long as the other two mentions above) - 1 star gained.AP2) Excellent stock keyboard. The swipe-up feature on appearing words to complete them is irritating, but despite you like it or not, this will probably one of the best keyboards you'll ever find in a smartphone. I have an Android and I use SwiftKey since I can't stand Android's stock keyboard. Apple's keyboard is perfect for what it is, but iOS 7 introduced some delays switching between different keyboard layers, and I also find them a little too cramped on the phones. If typing is the most you do on your phone and you don't like Android and SwiftKey combo, Z10 is for you for this one feature alone. 1 star gained.Cons:AC1) No apps besides all regular stock apps, and a few social-media apps. This kind loves to try and tinker with new apps, play games, and overall, can't deal with a nearly-empty app store and bad ports. Remember, just because email and text messaging and other ""routine"" apps are well done, no phone today will gain a star. Not going above and beyond will certainly hurt. 1 star lost.AC2) Sluggish vertical scrolling, great horizontal scrolling. This is a 2013 release, and I cannot understand why overall speed cannot just be fast, and why vertical scroll is sluggish. This kind hates sluggishness! 1 star lost.AC3) Small size battery with no extended battery alternative available. Heavy usage would get you through probably 3/4th of a day. 1 star lost.Kind B) Heavy business users who seek minimal entertainment. Overall rating 4/5Pros:BP1) Same as AP2. 1 star gained.BP2) Email, call voice quality, LED notifications, typical BB ringtones, and profiles etc. are just like your good old Blackberry and they are still effortlessly great, and now on a full-size touch-screen and with nicer icons. All your settings are also there just like before and while there are a lot of them, the seasoned Blackberry user will become familiar in no time. 1 star gained.BP3) A much better apps and games store (Blackberry World) is here for the little enthusiast in you. Go ahead, experience what the rest of the world was playing back a couple of years, while you were breaking bricks for living. 1 star gained.BP4) Ever imagined 8 megapixels packed into a cell phone camera (albeit with a useless flash)? You will now never feel left out in parties, team events, and outings where you thought a little better camera wouldn't hurt. 1 star gained.Cons:BC1) Same as AC3). 1 star lost.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I belong to kind A, and I am returning Z10, and keeping my S3 despite its cons. Its pros outweigh Z10 in every way.",2014年1月28日 在美国审核
Fantastic smartphone,"Pros: Best Keyboard ever! I have it set to two languages, and use them intermittently in the same email/text. The BB Z10 autocorrect and word predictions work simultaneously and pretty much flawlessly.2. The HUB houses all communication without having to open and close email and social media apps.3. Cellphone settings are easy to set.4. APPS ARE AVAILABLE: if you download 1Mobile Market, you have access to downloading pretty much any Android App. I wouldn't recommend downloading the FB app through 1Mobile tho. The BB World app for FB works a lot better.5. The camera for the phone is awesome. There is a setting that allows you to take 10 pics in a few second of the same shot, letting you pick the best shot taken. Flash works great. Pictures are beautiful.6.Beautiful screen resolution.Cons: App lack of availability through BB World was a con until 1Mobile app became an option.",2014年12月11日 在美国审核
best phone ive ever owned,BB10 os is fast and allows me to do work on my phone never before imaginable. Ive had quite a dew iphones and can honestly say this is more useful. I dont need app because the browser supports mostly anything the web can throw at it. Just because apple says flash is dead doesn't mean its true. The apps are becaue the browser sucks.,2013年8月12日 在美国审核
Great phone!,"I got my Z10 on April 2nd and so far I've enjoyed it very much. At first I had to learn its gestures and got hooked immediately. Now BIS (blackberry legacy internet service) is not needed and boy does it make a difference in download speeds! Updates to BB10 are coming fast and battery life is great for me: a full work day.The Hub is the modern implementation of the universal inbox and it's really amazing for productivity. Besides, exchange active sync integration as well as major protocols (imap, caldav, carddav) make it a breeze to have all your info in sync. Add a 32 or 64Gb card and you're in for music, pictures, videos and whatnot.",2013年4月11日 在美国审核
Good but Not Great due to lack of apps - CAN INSTALL ANDROID APPS,"I gave the BlackBerry Z10 a try because I wanted something different. I used both iPhone and Android phones. My last phone was Nexus 4 which I really liked. I had fo d memories and BlackBerry Curve and bold. Bold 9000 was one of my fav phone of all time. I know there is 9900 but I am fine typing on a touch screen and I do prefer the larger displays now. I wanted to see what they with the new blackberry.I like the clean design. Reminds me of the iPhone 5 but I do wish they had better battery door. Plastic battery door now squeaks to pressure. Metal like the storms would have been nicer. I love the display. High resolution, good colors, and responsive. It has micro SD card slot and dedicated hdmi port next to the micro usb port which is a plus. It has a front facing camera unlike older blackberrys and good rear camera.Now for the software. I have mixed feeling about the New os. I like the hub where all the new info is gathered in one place. I like the the keyboard a lot.It may actually be even better than the iPhone touch keyboard which is very good. I like swipe to wake which is different and neat. Still BlackBerry z10 has no navigation buttons whatsoever and uses gestures. It was a good try but still it's premature and not perfected. Swipe up is like a home button which is fine. But, swipe down is like a menu button whole in apps. I much rather it be notification pull down like iPhone or Android. I have to get out of an app to see new notifications. Also multi task has a dedicated page and acts as a home button. I don't like it. I rather it be a pull up like other os. Trying new things is good but gesture navigation sacrifices something that I miss dedicated buttons. Also BlackBerry could have taken gestures further with more gestures doing various tasks. Ipad uses multi finger gestures which is neat. BlackBerry tried to be too different needlessly.Lastly, biggest draw back for z10 is lack of apps. Smartphone is only as good as apps that enhances it's capability. Apple has literally apps for everything as do android and many for free. BlackBerry z10 has limited app support to say the least. No Netflix and other apps that I used often are not available in bb.Well, BlackBerry z10 is different. I like it but it doesn't feel as well refined. It's a good base to build upon and needs improvements. Also BlackBerry really needs to get app support. Almost makes me wish BlackBerry z10 would have been an android phone with blackberry overlay. Love the keyboard and the screen. Typing is best in the tradition of blackberry phones. Other areas need tweaks and adjustments. 3 stars only as of now.UPDATE:I learned that you can sideload (install downloaded android apk app files manually) android apps on Z10 without hacking or any modification the software.Since then I successfully installed apps like Netflix and other Android apps that I missed on this phone.The apps seem to work fine so far.I have updated and gave 4 stars instead of initial 3 stars.Lot more versatile with this capability.",2014年4月30日 在美国审核
The Z10 really is very impressive,"What can I say after two months or ownership - very good quality, smooth intuitive OS, some really nice features, gestures and the hub is simple efficient communicative perfection. All my email and social networking sites integrate perfectly and work effortlessly. For a combination of new phone and new OS BlackBerry have really excelled, never have I owned a new phone that has had so few issues and has kept me happy and grumble free.The biggest complaint I hear is lack of apps, but to be fair the library is growing fast and for the impatient you can 'sideload' ported androids apps and most but not all work fine. A lot of apps on numerous phone platforms are rubbish anyway and quality beats quantity in my mind. Yes Apple and Android may have more apps but they too once had only a few and really how many of these apps are essential?This is the first blackberry I have ever owned I left Nokia on windows OS to get it and if I'm brutally honest, I am loving it more every day.",2013年4月24日 在美国审核
Unmatched User Experience,"Let's start with the cons:1) If you consider learning a new user interface as a negative, then Z10 has a learning curve. It unlocks differently, notifications are different, user interface is different, email is handled differently if compared to iPhone or Android.2) App selection is limited, but I found all the apps I needed.Things that I find great on this phone1) Communication experience is super smooth. I can jump from Facebook to Twitter and reply to a Linked message all from a Unified Hub. It literally saves seconds every time I use the phone, but over the course of the day those seconds add up! (I save a minimum of 60 seconds each day that adds up to almost a 7 hours over the couse of a year. Year that's right! One full work day!)2) Navigation and user interface is different, but much more efficient. It's a joy to use the phone (need a week or two to adapt though)3) Awesome podcast and rss managers4) It only gets better, Balckberry keeps releasing updates that iron out all the kinks that come with a new OS. For example, my battery life is no longer a problem.And all the other stuff like security, BB Balance, easy device management for corporates etc etc. Personally I don't care much about that.",2013年3月25日 在美国审核
My gamble paid off,"I was at the top of the food chain with the note 2 when it was released, a couple of months ago the note 3 was released and instead of going note 3 I decided to try the Z10. Built quality is way better than Samsung and just for the privacy which I've now with BB 10 OS instead of having all my data handed over to the NSA is a no-brainer for me. I see with every new Android update (my wife has a note 2 with Jelly Bean 4.3) Android trying to simulate the 10 OS but full of holes. I'm very happy with the 10 OS it has everything Android has plus some exclusive that I really enjoy specially as I use my Z10 a lot for work.

Can't stop peeking and flowing!,"This is the freshest OS in a phone today.

Everything but the app store.,"First the shortfall: Still a lot of apps missing. Not Android missing, but WebOS missing. For those of you that don't understand, Android has most apps that iOS has, but not all essentials. WebOS hardly had any, and neither does Blackberry. A lot of apps still to come.... hopefully. One star penalized for this.Now on to the good news, this is a great device!Before I converted to iPhone with the first iPhone, I was an avid blackberry user &amp; lover. This makes that loving feeling come back a bit. The way the inbox is managed is beautiful. The way the OS swipes and moves around is simple and great. The speed is ok, not great, but not bad either.The screen looks great, the weight &amp; size are good, overall, I'm very pleased about this device! If you're at a company that requires blackberry, this is certainly the best option available and it's quite a large step up from previous options. That being said, the severe current lack of apps is probably enough of a buzzkill for a lot of people to steer clear.All I can hope is that additional apps come along.Everything else about this device and OS please me and make me happy. I could be happier here than on an Android if the apps were equal.",2013年3月28日 在美国审核
10tastic,"I was Blackberry power user and went on to try various platforms like Iphone 4S/5, Galaxy Nexus and S3 while Blackberry was in transition to BB10. Al-tough the competing platforms were eye candy but a huge a let down when it comes to productivity - namely email (unified inbox), key boards, notifications, multi-tasking and finer nitty gritties that Blackberry is known for (example : bedside mode, message compression, attach photos in email with lowered resolution on the fly, exceptional reception, security etc). Last 2 years for me was painfull since I have been patiently waiting for BB10 that was promised eye-candyness of other platforms combined with productivity features of good-ole Blackberries. Here comes the release and BB10 doesn't disappoint.The size, weight and tactile feel of the BlackBerry Z10 is a win for BlackBerry's designers and in an era where every smartphone vendor seems to be going towards bigger and bigger screens in an attempt to provide differentiation, the Z10 is perfect for single-handed use.The Z10 seemed to me to offer up crisper images than the other S3 and Iphone 5. Maybe that is because the Z10 tops the other two at 356 pixels per inch (ppi), compared to 306 ppi for the Galaxy S III and 326 ppi for the iPhone 5.Z10 has an 8-megapixel rear camera; however, the Z10 boasts a 2-megapixel front-facing camera , while the iPhone 5's camera is rated at 1.2 megapixels and the Galaxy S III's at 1.9 megapixels. All three have fast processors, with both the Z10 and Galaxy S III running the 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4. The iPhone 5 runs the Apple A6 processor. All three support LTE and up to 802.11n Wi-Fi.The Z10 offers NFC for file sharing and mobile payments, something the Galaxy S III also includes (but not the iPhone 5).BlackBerry Z10 is more than a piece of hardware - it has BB10 operating system that offers various services that add value to the overall user experience. Some of the cool Z10 features by BlackBerry are Story Maker, Remember, Balance, Hub and voice control and we would like to take a moment to discuss them as they add to the overall experience tremendously.The Hub acts as the single point for you to check all your updates, like new Facebook notifications, tweets, emails, LinkedIn messages, SMSs etc. If you want to open it, you just have to keep swiping towards the left of the screen till you cross the first menu page and task switcher. It is very easy to navigate and gives you options like posting new messages, emails and social network updates, depending on the service you are working on in the Hub.BlackBerry Balance is a feature aimed at corporate users who want to keep their work and personal lives separate - on their phone. It allows users to store apps and data on two distinct profiles - Work and Personal. Users can easily switch between the two profiles and users who bring their device to office can easily format the Work profile when they switch jobs without having to change any setting in the personal one.Call Quality is exceptionally good with HD voice and reception is better than Iphone 5 or Galaxy S3. Battery has improved by 30% after the first OS update (it better than S3 and more or less same as Iphone 5)",2013年3月20日 在美国审核

The Z10 is the best smartphone on the market!!!,"I bought a Z10 on sale, after researching it, and comparing it to other devices. I can tell you that the Z10 is the best smartphone on the market for many reasons. First it is priced cheaper that the competition saving you around $250! Second the BB10 OS is the best operating system available, and the hub will make your life so much easier. Connect you yahoo, gmail, linkedin, messengers, social media, and other accounts to the hub, and then with a single swipe you can access all of these accounts compressed into days, or you can see your mail without ever opening up an app, or browser! You will also notice that your contacts are magically linked to their respective accounts!!! Amazing!!!! I am so happy with my new Z10, that I can't speak highly enough about it. Even if you want to use it as an iPod touch replacement, you can buy it for near the same price, and it can be upgraded to 80gb with a micro sd! Don't buy into the Apple price gouging!

Changed my outlook on phones,"In 2011 I decided to make the upgrade to a smartphone. I was set against I-phone because I feel it's not for me, and against BlackBerry as I felt an air of arrogance from the company and their users. I chose the Nexus 4. The experience at first was great (probably because it was my first smartphone).Then the minor bugs popped up, like freezes requiring re-boots and an inability to see many webpages. I changed to the Chrome browser, and still the same problem. I chalked it up to the fact this is a small computer, and thus won't have the same functionality. Then the power button began to stop working. Re-setting became a nightmare, and I had to remove my case and remove the battery to re-start. It was a massive hassle, and what started as having to do this only about 2-3 per week became 4-5 times daily. I checked online and saw it's a common problem. Whenever Chrome went to a website with flash, the entire phone would freeze. My frustration boiled over.I decided to take the plunge with the Z-10 and take advantage of the 2-week return policy. This phone is a revolution. It has almost all the functionality of a laptop computer. Things I've noticed so far:(1) The browsing is extremely smooth and fast. Videos play on websites. The browser will even alert me if a website uses flash extensively, and if I want to turn flash on for this particular site.(2) I am shocked Google and Apple did not figure out swiping earlier. It is intuitive, and lets me do multiple things on my phone. When I use my wife's Nexus 4 (which she is desperate to part with), I have to control my movements and remember there is a home button. It's like a right hander trying to write with the left hand. Same type of awkwardness.(3) Small things make this phone wonderful. The weather app displays a colour to match the weather of the day (which is important in Vancouver), the alarm clock is easy to set, linking with my laptop is easy, sending out an e-mail with the HUB (and the ability to choose from multiple accounts) is very handy etc.(4) The HUB itself is a very intuitive creation, and I am not surprised it was not thought of earlier. Having all my e-mails and messages in one area and the ability to ""peek"" at them without terminating what I am already doing on the phone is awesome.(5) The camera is superb. The time-shift mode is for more than just closed eyes. Timed correctly, it lets you take multiple shots of a moving object and choose the one you like best. We've gotten some amazing shots of our little guy on the swing with this. The latest software update added HDR capability to it.(6) I've never had a hard keyboard on a phone, so I cannot compare. I can also only compare to the Android and iOS keyboard. The Z-10 keyboard is light years ahead of the previous two. The responsiveness is leagues ahead, the accuracy is incomparable and the predictive text feature is scary. I find myself writing longer texts and e-mails in a fraction of the time. I am actually swiping more than typing.(7) The battery life is far superior to the Nexus I had. Without heavy use my battery is lasting upwards of 36+ hours. Heavy use means I am charging every night when I head to bed. Not bad!(8) No rebooting. At all. This has been a big relief for my blood pressure.(9) There was a lack of apps when I started, but more seems to be coming online. I've recently seen Skype and SoundHound available (among others). From what I've read, the apps are coming and coming fast.I would suggest you try the phone out. I believe most carriers have a return policy within a certain time. I've found it to be the next step in the evolution of the smartphone.",2013年6月8日 在美国审核

"Fantastic UI and well-made phone.  A pleasure to use, but let down a bit by so-so battery life and missing core apps.","I've been using the phone for a while now, and quite like it.The best thing about it is the interface, which -- from the home page to accessing the settings -- is beautifully intuitive.I hope BB 10 hangs in there, and makes it to BB 12, 14.......It's the first phone UI that doesn't feel like an half-hearted afterthought, thrown together to provide some sort of access to the apps and hardware.Handling email and texts is a far happier experience than on Android or iOS.Hardware-wise, the phone is....a phone.Seems durable without being a tank -- I've dropped it from high enough to dent the corners, and it keeps on going. Doesn't scream 'flagship phone' like some, well, flagship phones do; but it seems well-built.Screen is good, except in direct sunlight.Call quality is pretty much on a par with that of any other decent-quality phone - so dependent on carrier and location that it's foolish to draw angry conclusions about the phoneitself.It's worse than my old Galaxy on the third floor, but better on the ground floor......The processor seems more than adequate: nothing, including browsing, lags.I suspect that the QNX operating system is inherently more efficient/less demanding than Android or iOs.The camera is fine: nothing special, but it wasn't marketed as a camera phone.The only issue, hardware-wise, is the only-mediocre battery life.I'm sure they could have found room for a bigger battery in there -a phone should reliably last out the day, whatever you throw at it.The poor selection of apps is another issue.I'm not bothered that there isn't easy access to the million plus apps that the competitors offer: 995,000 of those are just ways of filling up empty time or being impressed.But there are basic functions that Blackberry themselves really should have made sure were available, rather than leave things up to a marketplace which has so far let them down -- things like the Swiftkey swipe keyboard, or a rock-solid camera to OCR function, or a really good ebook reader.....The lack of fairly essential (at least for me) apps is the issue it is only because I really don't think I could bear going back to another UI after using BB 10.This is the first phone I've owned that actually is a pleasure to use.",2015年1月11日 在美国审核

Z10 is evolutionary!,"I've been a faithful Blackberry user for many years, but also used a Samsung Note II.I can tell you that the Z10 experience is amazing and this is why.- phone is minimalistic and symbolizes the core nature of the phone, it's not about the hardware, it's about the things you can do with this device- perfect size and weight of the phone, as well as rubber backing, allows for easy single and two finger typing- screen size and resolution is great for both leisure use and business functions (for me, it's email and news)- word prediction is smart and builds on your typing behavior, so that someone like myself that's been using a qwerty keyboard adapted really quickly to a touchscreen keyboard- the Activation frames and Hub, feels as if you're not confined by a device, but able to process and move around the thoughts in your head; it's fast and able to multi-task effectively- stable OS which I haven't had to do any re-boots (over the last two weeks of use)- multimedia features are far more sophisticated than the previous models and while they may not be the best in market, it's more than enough for most people's needs- there are numerous shortcuts and tips for how to optimize your experience, and that learning process is actually quite fun;contrary to my Notes II, these tips are not gimmicky (e.g. tapping the top of my device), but more simply about communicating efficiently.- some of the software that it comes with have been so useful and fully integrated into the OS experience such as Box (free for 5MB)and linkedin.- quite durable, dropped it a couple of times from my nightstand onto a hardwood floor, not a single blemish or malfunction.",2013年3月25日 在美国审核
Great quality built.,"This phone served me well for over 3 years. What a great phone, unfortunately it is finally starting messing up so I had to change phones.

Even though the pic were 8 Mpixels, the quality was more than I needed. The only complain I have was the address book, it was always very clumsy, and confusing. It didn't handle duplicates very well.

BB10 is the BEST OS I ever used,"I work for a big telecom operator and doesn't like itunes but like the marketing from apple. So almost 5 years ago I worked and tested android in the early days and buying after iphone an android 1.6 Mobile LG but chance it after few months for a Samsung Galaxy S, S2 and HTC ONE+ but at work I had to test Blackberry 10 for our network and BES10 and I fall in love with Blackberry 10 and get set to buy a HTC ONE. I tested the Z10 and Q10 before it was even launched and after a few days my android phone feels outdated.. Blackerry 10 was strange for a hour but it was so good and easy to work andhandeling an android phone seems odd to use so I bought the blackberry 10 OS which i like because it give me the same feeling when i used the first time android 1.6. in android i saw the future but these days BB10 with 10.2 in front is beyond android/ios but you must feel and see it.Good things I like to use is playing mp3 by wifi 2 my surround blueray player or watch photo's/movies i made on my tv and also with wifi. I also like the wificonnection with my computer so that i can easily send and mp3 album to my phone. I love the keyboard the most because typing in English, dutch and Deutsch is soeasy that it almost know what i want to write. The HUB where all your sociale media and mail traffic comes in one place where you can reply is the best and better than on windows 8.BBM never used but some friend and abroad in Asia, US, Europe and Australia using it and i love to see the D of delivery but most more the R of Read and that is great because you can not find this on whatsapp which has more server problems then BBM it seems.

"super fast phone, better then my Samsung Android phone","Coming from Samsung Android. The Blackberry z10 is a game changer IMHO.Pros:- Super fast. I mean this phone is a multitasking beast. You can open upto 8 apps and switch in between them without closing them. Android couldn't do that. With my Samsung I had to close an app to open another, thanks God i don't have to do that anymore.- Keyboard. THe keyboard is the best I have used in all my previous phones. The phone's keyboard learns your typing and predicts your next choices of words and all you have to do is to swipe them up and that's it.- Camera. Camera is better then my Samsung Droid and I like the timeshift feature.- Battery. Battery last about a day and a half with light use or a day with heavy load. The best part about it, that it is removable. Yes, unlike iphone you don't have to change your phone.- Blackberry Balance. Probably the best feature. It allows you to separate your personal and work space. In order to use this feature, you should have BES 10 setup at your work and that's it.Cons:- Not a lot of apps there YET. Even though i only use less then 10 apps, the only one is missing for me is Skype. Blackberry rep told me that it should be released in 1-2 weeks. Just today, eBay released their app. So, it is not a con yet, but if you are heavy app user please check to make sure all your apps are available. Although you can sideload any Android app to work on z10.",2013年3月25日 在美国审核
Great Phone,"I bought the Z10 direct from RIM on a special offer unlocked for $200. I know there's a lot of talk that RIM is circling the drain but I couldn't pass it up. I have an iPad that I love so I got an iPhone 4S and couldn't believe how much I didn't like it once I got it. My main complaints were battery life of about 4 hours and Siri couldn't understand a word I said.The Z10 OS update to 10.2 was a huge improvement over 10.1 for select cut/copy past. The iOS cut copy feature does work better but not much. I tried the Z10 interface at the store when it first came out and was immediately turned off. I read reviews and watched some of the training videos as they recommended because the interface does take some getting used to. I also picked a vacation week to switch over to the new phone. It will take you some time to get used to the new interface. It was extremely frustrating trying to enter the information for five email accounts but that was when it was OS 10.1.So now I love the phone. The browser is great and plays flash. I'm not much for apps I just want email and web browsing but there are enough apps for me. Weather, Travel, Sports, Password keeper.",2014年3月22日 在美国审核

Love it!,"I went from an iphone 4s to this and I'm so glad I did. It's an amazing phone and I have nothing bad to say about it at this point. It's lighter yet studier (yes I managed to drop it once already) than my old phone, holds a charge longer, has less glitches / errors and from what I understand way more secure. I have only had it for a couple weeks so I will update more later. But so far so good! Totally happy.Update: nearly a year later and still loving this phone. yes there are a few issues - like the lack of apps with blackberry phones, the camera could be better (it's better than my last iphone but not as good as the new iphone or galaxy) but all phones have issues and this is still a great, reliable, sleek looking, secure phone! Love it still!",2013年4月7日 在美国审核
BB Zed10 is Amazing,"Although I did not purchase this phone from Amazon. I could not be happier with the phone. Right up front I will say it does not YET have as many apps as some other phones, but it will happen. Moving on, this is my second BB ( had a 9650BOLD). My first all touch screen. Had trouble every time I used someone else's droid, or iflop. This phone does what I want it to when I want it too. Its super smart. It changes to fit you, it learns you, but still while making it easy for anyone else to use. The screen quality is unmatched and the sound quality is great.

Junk!,"I was getting tired of my iphone so when my contract was up I got this phone and omg I have had so many problems with it it's not even funny I have had this phone for I think 2 months now (might be 3) and I have gone through 3 of them already plus I had to get a new battery (which I explain below).Problems I have been having:- Had to restart it twice, once because everything on the screen got really wide and big and the 2nd time was some of the apps quit working- I have had to replace the battery because the battery would only last 4 hours (fully charged)- Have problems with the wifi it keeps going on and off, I know it's not my internet connection because I tested the wifi connection on another electronic I have to see if it would shut off and it didn't.- Overheats: I know a phone will get warm when you use it but mine was just laying there on my end table wasn't using it at the time and it was very warm, I also read on the blackberry message board that people are having the same overheating problem as me.So if you are thinking about getting this phone don't just save yourself the hassle and get a phone that will actually work",2013年10月3日 在美国审核
Amazing phone,"I just replaced my iphone to this phone and am not looking back. I have been so pleasantly surprised by this phone. It blows my mind how quickly I can navigate between opening a new app, getting to an already open app, my email, texts, etc. I love swiping quickly between the screens, truly innovative. The camera is great, I understand it has a feature where it captures a few seconds before and after the photo is taken and this can be used in case the subject blinks etc. The browser speed blows my iphone out of the water. I also love how the url/search box is on the bottom of the phone, compared to the top on the iphone. Many times with my old phone in google I had problems with trying to re-type in the search bar and the keyboard would push the search bar out of screen. I have no issues with battery life as was one of my initial concerns with the phone. Seems to be holding up great. The keyboard is absolutely amazing with the new feature that can finish the word for you by making a small swipe up. Another concern I had with the phone was the apps available; however, I spoke with netflix this morning and the representative reported that they are currently working on developing an app for blackberry, so this is great news. I think in the next upcoming weeks we will be seeing thousands more apps becoming available as the phone grows in popularity. I remember when iphone started and there were barely an any apps available. Regardless, I love this phone, the speed, ""the hub,"" truly a remarkable phone! I don't think I could ever go back to an iphone.",2013年3月23日 在美国审核
Important to know before you buy - There are 4 different models of the Z10,"This is really important for everyone to know.The Z10 comes in four different models.You have to buy the correct one based on where you live and the carrier you use.You need to ask the seller which model they are selling.Go here to see a full description of the four models: [...] .If you want it to work on ATT or TMobile in the US, you need the 100-3.Verizon in the US is 100-4.Some international countries are the 100-2 and 100-1.Be careful of the 100-1 as this is a 3g phone model only and does not come with the Snapdragon processor.Do not buy from any vendor until you have asked them which one they sell.All the vendors are listed under the other ""NEW"" phones to buy.Just follow the link on the Amazon page to see a description of all the sellers.If you don't, you have a 25% chance of getting the right phone for you, which is why so many reviews say ""it worked"" or ""it didn't work"" even though they are on the same network.Update 1/9/2014I must say I have been disappointed with the Z10. I really wanted to support Blackberry, but this phone just doesn't do it for me.Let me note the below may be user error, but some just don't point to the great phone I thought I was getting. I am returning for the following issues:1) Battery life is poor - If I don't use it much for calls it easily makes it through the day and night.However, on three straight days where I needed to be on the phone straight for 90+ minutes, the phone died and shut off as soon within 30 minutes of usage2) No zoom feature.You can't pinch the screen and make it larger to read texts, etc.Yes, you can adjust the font, but this doesn't help me for when I have glasses on or don't.3) The voice recognition is nothing short of dismal.I have a very flat Midwestern accent. The phone constantly misses easy words and there is no way to correct other than delete the entire string and start over again.4) Where is the on/off for GPS?It is always on.5) There are not enough of the apps available for this phone as I had on my last Android which I need for work6) I tried to load music to the phone a number of times.It shows the music, but will not play7) Everything takes more than one step.For example, to send a text you must open phone, slide over to texts, slide open texts, hit button to create text, go to contacts to find person, select person.This contrasts with one click on android and start to input name and it pops up.Everything is two to three extra steps.Very frustrating8) You can't delete just one text message in a string, but you must delete every text message in a string or none.This makes no sense to me as you may only want one message gone and not the entire string.9) The phone came with a Blackberry charger, clearly marked Blackberry.Yet every time I plug it in a message pops up telling me to use the original charger or it will take longer to charge?But I am using the original Blackberry charger!10) Turning of WiFi calling was nothing but a nightmare.Every time I entered a WiFi area a notification popped up telling me to initiate WiFi calling.Very annoying until I spent an hour online to figure out how to disable this feature.11) I saved this for last and for the second time.The voice recognition is nothing short of terrible.It simply doesn't work with any kind of reliability and is very frustrating.I am sad to have to return the phone as I really wanted to support Blackberry.This phone, after a Samsung Galaxy, was very disappointing.

"Great Phone, Perfect For One-Handed Use","Review Update - Jan 7, 2017:Later versions of BlackBerry 10 are vastly improved from the one I reviewed below, and is clearly now the best operating system for productivity, security, and a seemless interface with Microsoft Outlook email and calendar.I liked the predictive text on the Z10 so much and the ease of one-handed use, along with the ideal pocket size, that I recently purchased a new one on Amazon.Unfortunately, it seemed to actually be a refurbished one with Verizon paperwork on the as-ordered AT&amp;T device in an open, unsealed box designed to be that way.All other BlackBerry devices that I have purchased on Amazon have arrived in the original sealed, high-quality BlackBerry packaging.So, I returned the device and Amazon provided a rapid refund.I think the Z10 with the latest BB10 software is an excellent phone, is good in hand, and has a very good browser.On photos, it is best to just drag them from the phone and not use the BlackBerry software (at least for Mac).The one weakness is that while the industrial design is excellent, the materials are really a little inexpensive looking for me.The Z30 solves this problem, or any of BlackBerry's keyboard devices.If you can find one new, and price under $150 is a great value for the quality of this phone with 4G LTE.I initially wrote a review with a five star rating given my initial enthusiasm for the Z10 (Verizon), based on the size of the screen, gesture based operating system (rather than a home button) with the Hub and Peek, removable battery, advanced keyboard, etc.However, as I gained experience on the device, it became apparant to me that this is a really challenged phone for the following reasons:- Clunky BB10 operating system that doesn't work smoothly, and is frustrating to use even after getting used to the various gestures.Part of this is the gesture based system, part the rendering of the screens, and the part is poor functional design (i.e. why are certain buttons at the far upper left-hand corner of the screen where it is hard to reach?).- Keyboard that lacks precision and only makes up for this in the error correction algorithm which is very good.The individual keys just do not respond well and the glass feels slick - like typing on ice - and so while the error correction and flick typing help, this doesn't make for a very satisfying experience overall.- Just fair battery life, so it is a good thing that the battery is replaceable, because it will need to be replaced about 2/3 through a busy day on the road.And the battery is slow to charge through a low-quality micro-USB connection.- Good phone and speakerphone that is marred by issues with visual voicemail (had to replace phone once after it froze entirely), accidental dialing (more than any phone I have had), and answering through the gesture/swipe.- Music player with limited options and fair sound quality.The Neutron app is available for $4.99, but this should be standard for what I paid for the device.- Browser that is improved over past BlackBerry browsers and accommodates Flash, but will not render email images to the correct size.- Camera that does have a useful fast shutter option to capture good faces plus some good effects options, but the low light photos are fair, and the video rendering is jittery.- Desktop software via BB Link that is just terrible - this by itself is a complete deal breaker.Have never seen such a difficult to use program of its kind, making transfering pictures and music a struggle.I tried just dropping files directly to the device, but my computer wouldn't recognize the Z10 as a drive.- Low quality look - the fit and finish is bland and not up to the competition.After awhile, I just didn't like using a device that looked so dull, in addition to working in such a clunky, frustrating way.- And yes, applications, or lack of them.There are few really good apps (Neutron, Kindle, and LinkedIn are a few good ones).The main bright spot was the screen size, which made the browser a partially effective back-up for the lack of apps, and good durability, as the device can survive a drop.But in the end, this phone and desktop software was so frustrating, I ended up asking my IT department to get me an iPhone 5s, which is an incredible phone.This was a hard decisions, as I went back to BlackBerry a couple years ago after realizing the old BlackBerry 7 Bolds being snappy and efficient for email, as compared to my last iPhone (a 3GS).However, this new iPhone 5s is extremely fast, and the application ecosystem is amazing.The one-touch fingerprint unlock is an incredible feature that works far better than BlackBerry's method of typing in a passcode (which didn't work half the time).Having access to the applications that are common now, that simply work, provides amazing functionality, and now that I am on the iPhone 5s platform, I can see the vast difference.I see people on these reviews write that the browser/large screen makes up for not having good apps - but that is just innacurate.Many applications that are on iOS, like MOG, HP12c calculator, and Sonos controller, have no BB10 or website equivalent.Most discouraging is the recent decision by the company to move away from hardware and new devices, especially high-end ones.This is ultimately why I lost hope in the platform and made the switch to Apple.It makes no sense to be pushing the enterprise network without a ""must have"" device that requires it.One of the mistakes of the Z10 and Q10 is that IT departments have the option of just using ActiveSynch, without the need to use the secure BlackBerry network (which also provides an ongoing revenue stream to the company).Yes, the BlackBerry device is more secure itself, but this isn't enough of a reason to use the device over an iPhone, and the secure network is needed for this security feature to be fully there.BlackBerry should focus on an updated keyboard Bold device with higher quality materials, bring back the track pad/back button (this simple ommission prevented many exisitng Bold users from switching to the Q10, plus worries about the company going out of business), customization of alerts, incredible email/Outlook Exchange functionality, good desktop software, a great music player and camera, and the best phone/voicemail set-up you can buy, and long battery life, plus, BlackBerry should have its own in-house programmers writing BB10 applications for the most used Android/Apple apps (or, just drop BB10 now and move quickly to Android - I hear this might be happening soon).They should also bring back the simple docking/charging station which worked so well with the older Bolds.This type of device might win back users focused on productivity who have left the platform, as then BlackBerry would offer something meaningfully different than the current available offerings, and it would be of interest to the few existing BlackBerry customers that are looking to upgrade.I hope the best for BlackBerry, as I liked a lot about my old Bold device.Perhaps the company cana way to build a new device aimed around the corporate user that provides the busy executive handling over 100 emails per day the most useful communication tool possible.Unfortunately, the Z10 is less efficient as an email processor and a phone, and much less funcitional overall than it's iPhone competition, which is unfortunate.",2013年4月22日 在美国审核

So, after a few months of trying to use the new phone I bought the Blackberry Z-10. Much to my surprise I can't synch my Outlook. The instrument itself is OK.

Caution: Do Not Purchase If you travel internationally often!!!!,"I have been a blackberry user for almost 10 years....and have loved every minute of it.When I heard of a newer blackberry coming out I jumped at the opportunity to purchase.The first week I was very satisfied with the phone.After about 3 weeks I travelled internationally and thus the problems began.When I purchased the phone NO ONE informed me that the Z10 runs on a different operating system than the previous blackberry's...thus I would be charged different internationally.The emails and texts, etc previously went through the Blackberry network and now they don't which means you are charged $15/MB for every email, text, etc.After returning from my international visit and seeing my bill for $900 for 1 week and I didn't make one call nor use the internet I tried to take the phone back to the store and of course it was past my return date!!!!So now I'm stuck with this phone and I either have to purchase an older blackberry to use while I'm traveling internationally or turn the phone off completely.Two thumbs down for not informing customers of these changes!!!!",2013年5月30日 在美国审核

On My 3rd Phone in 4 Months,"I got the new Blackberry Z10 smartphone on the first day it was available at T-Mobile.My husband has had the BlackBerry Bold, Curve and others and they have been great phones.I got my first one in late March and its now August and I'm now on phone #3.My first one last until mid-May when it completely quit working and I was told that it was a ""software glitch"" and that they would send me another one.My 2nd phone worked until the first of August and then when I took it back to T-Mobile, I was told that my ""Operating System crashed"".So, I'm now on phone #3 and wondering how long it will last.When you pay $500 for a phone, it should last more than 2 months.The battery drains quickly even when the phone is not being used.I have to charge mine several times a day because of this.Sometimes my phone will be sitting right next to me and my voice mail will light up.I got a call, but it never rang and it happened when I was waiting for a call back for a job interview over the phone.The choice of app's are OK, but not nearly the selection as the iPhone.I love Angry Birds and only have access to the free Angry Birds Star Wars and the paid version of Space.The Z10 and the iPhone were released by T-Mobile on the same day and now I regret not going with the iPhone.If my 3rd phone quits working, I'm going with the iPhone.Update: My 3rd BlackBerry Z10 quit working......after 20 days. I had it on the charger because it was getting to where I would have to charge it twice a day and the battery would drain when I wasn't even using it. The phone was working, I took it off the charger and it went dead. I took everything back to T-Mobile and they weren't able to get the phone to start up and they told me that because this was my 3rd time I could choose any phone....and I went with the iPhone5 and I love it. Much easier to use, way more access to apps too. I wish I'd done it 5 months ago.",2013年8月9日 在美国审核

Beautiful Media Phone but Fails at Business,"I'm a Blackberry Bold 9900 owner who just went from switching from to the Z10, to back to the 9900.The Z10 is beautiful phone, larger screen than an iPhone but not so huge that it's like walking around with a clunky, mini tv monitor.It's sleek, light weight and the screen resolution is beautiful. I really love the screen's UI.The virtual key pad is big and easy to use (I had far fewer typos using it than I did trying an iPhone).The gesturing on the phone takes some getting used to, because it's initially not intuitive (you definitely need to go online and read the manual), but one could master it easily and become quick enough with it over time.The Browser totally rocks compared to the OS 7 BlackBerrys and is probably faster than the iPhone.All of the reports that the phone constantly reboots, is just rubbish. The phone worked fine without any issues or hang-ups.But Blackberry seems to think that all anyone wants, is a phone for music, games and YouTube, because that's where it seems to end, if you own a BlackBerry primarily for business use.Gone from OS 10 are the features that are a legacy of BlackBerry and made BlackBerry popular with business owners.Out is the BlackBerry Desktop Software with the intelligent, adjustable feature, ""Selective Sync"".In is the BlackBerry Link with sync options only for iTunes, Photos, Video and Documents (that's apparently all of your Document Folder).No Calendar options and No Contact Options are shown.I had to speak with technical support on the phone for to find out how to sync those two and then there are two disappointing problems (for me) there.Calendar:Out is being able to sync an Outlook calendar from your PC or an iCal fromyour Mac. Not being able to sync those to the phone, was standard with the 7 OS.In is copying your Calendar from your computer to the Cloud and pasting them into your Z10 Calendar from there.The ability to sync those calendars via the BlackBerry Link, ""wont be available until later this year"" (As told to me by a BlackBerry tech and reported in numerous forums).Contacts:Out is the intelligent organization of your contacts via categories (ex: Legal, Manufacturers, Dealers, Employees, Shipping, Friends, Family, etc.).In is your contact list being limited only to ""All"" or ""Favorites"".Speed Dialing:Outis One touch speed dialing via single key pad assignment for frequently called phone numbers (ex: Key 2 for a supplier A, Key 3 for your Office, Key 8 for a Family member and so on.)In is: Gesturing to your Contact folder and scrolling down through All of your contacts or Scrolling to your Favorites (limited to 10) and scrolling through those and pressing on their name to call them.Unlike pressing a single key to make a call (as with your voice mail) neither of those options is something that you can do safely while driving.Phone Calls:Out is disconnecting on a call or dismissing a call while in any screen.In is gesturing back to the calling screen to disconnect or dismiss.Search:Out is universal search from the Home page.If none of the above bothers you, but you are a person who only likes to type on a hard key pad, then you should wait for the Q10.Unfortunately, if the use of BlackBerry's legacy features (as mentioned above) are more important to you for running your day to day business, than cropping photos and making videos, then neither phone will work for you at this time.And forget about visiting the BlackBerry forums or any other support group to get answers, you'll only be treated like an idiot and flamed by the BB employees that run them or post in them.",2013年4月16日 在美国审核

New BlackBerry user coming from Android,"First off, I'm probably going to take some heat from this review. BlackBerry users are fierce when it comes to any negativity. I understand, you love your phone. However, everyone should know what they're getting into when they're buying a phone. This is just one average users opinion, take it with a grain of salt and keep in mind all of the positive things along with the negatives when you're deciding to spend the next two years with a phone.I'll be comparing the Z10 with my experiences with the iPhone 5 and a few android phones. I'm a long time user of androids, and a new user of the iPhone. I had this phone for approximately a week before my trail period ended with Verizon and I could still exchange for another phone cheaply. If you have an extra $35 to decide if this phone is truly for you, I would definitely take that path. Ask your Carrier the conditions on trying out a new phone, and how long you can keep it before they charge you ANOTHER activation fee (if you keep it over a certain period of time and then exchange it, you'll be hit with two activation charges AND a restocking fee.)On too the review...I'll start with the negative first, so the positives don't seem so glamorous. Be aware I said negative, singular. It's a big negative for a lot of people and a deal breaker for me. As much as there is to love (as you've probably already read with the many positive reviews) there's really something that's detrimental to this phone: the app market. Many users have slightly dismissed this and people often don't give apps enough thought when choosing a phone. Mostly because they've always been there, and presumably, always will. This is especially true for a brand new BlackBerry user (such as myself and the group BlackBerry is targeting with this phone). Strongly consider how many apps you use. Nowadays, apps basically rule the phone. It's not so important any more the gigs of ram it has, or whether it's a quad processor or dual. If there are no apps to take advantage of hardware, it's basically a moot point. And honestly, there really aren't many apps that take advantage of the powerful system.There aren't many apps at all.One of the things that makes the iPhone so crazy popular are the apps. All apps are meticulously combed by Apple itself, and most apps are cheap, well made, and extremely useful. When a company decides to build an app, they instinctively choose Apple. Then comes an Android version. However, most major developers such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Skype, Spotify, Instagram, Hulu, smaller banks, and a lot of others have ignored BlackBerry. The thing is; it's incredibly easy to port an android app to the BlackBerry. You could even do it yourself, really, you can (albeit in a buggier state). Why haven't they? Honestly, I have no idea. It's a large user base they can take advantage of, it's bigger than Windows mobile. But what matters is they haven't, and some, such as Netflix, have already stated they have no interest in doing so. BlackBerry has announced they're negotiating with Skype to build an app. That was months ago. As I've already said, you could probably port a buggy version of Skype yourself. So what's taking a multibillion corporation so long to do it? Most likely, they have no real intention of making an app. If you, yourself, can do it, it would probably only take a day for ONE professional programmer to make a native BlackBerry app. They've had 4+ months.This was a huge, unforgivable deal for me. When the Verizon Rep. first told me there wasn't that many apps, I kind of shrugged, I thought maybe he was exaggerating and all the apps I wanted would be there, either that or I could live without them. However, when I received the phone it turned out I had a really hard time not having the apps I used every single day not there. Spotify, a music service I absolutely love, was not there. Netflix wasn't there, Skype wasn't there, Amazon wasn't there, YouTube wasn't there, Google Maps wasn't there (BlackBerry's version is okay - not great), my password safe wasn't there (you can't copy and paste into password fields anyways), and other smaller apps and games I really enjoyed weren't there either. The rep wasn't kidding. There really aren't that many apps. I decided, however, I have the phone so I might as well give it the good ol' college try and see what happens. Soon enough I found myself not being able to rely on my phone. All the things I used to do, I really couldn't do anymore. I felt like I was compromising all the time with it. In the end, I felt it was too much not to be able to use my phone like I wanted too, it simply wasn't worth it, and I wasn't about to wait indefinitely for developers to maybe, someday, kind of, develop an app for it. I'd tweet this as a huge first world problem - but there's no Twitter app to do that either.But, I understand there's people who don't use Spotify, Netflix, or any of the others I use daily. They might never have even thought to use them even if they were available. And to those people I say: this is the best phone on the market for you. It's really outstanding, seriously, it's phenomenal. There's so many things I did love about the phone. It's quick, it's smooth, the browser and keyboard is the top of it's class. Mutitasking is an absolute breeze and the phone is super intuitive. This is the ultimate business phone. But that's just it. It's the ultimate business phone, and in it's current state, leaves little room to do anything else other than productivity.However... if you're the type of person who uses even one of the apps I mentioned that aren't there, then you'll never be completely satisfied with this phone. I think everyone will love a lot of things about this phone, but when they learn they can't use the phone like they'd expect because of a lack of apps, they'll also learn to hate the phone.",2013年5月8日 在美国审核

The most innovative phone to had came out for years,"I had been using this phone for over a month now since it came out in Canada and all I can say is WOW! If you are looking for a different and more productive way do stuff, this is the best phone out there. The Hub is probably the best feature on this phone: you can do everything there without even opening the app. Answer emails, reply Whatsapp, BBM, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn... all this from any app that you are using. No more buttons, no more scrolling to the app. you have native DLNA support so you can just ""Play To"" directly to TV wirelessly without having to buy an Apple TV or something similar. Play music or movies wirelessly! Send emails with multiple attachments... type on the best touchscreen keyboard. you don't even have to hit the correct letter, it will guess what letter you intended to type and correct the word for you. I can even type with my eyes closed! And guess what? do all that at the same time with no penalty (stream wirelessly a movie to TV, browse the internet and answer emails)! the Dual Core feels like its an octo core! Time shift camera is incredible to take picture of kids or big groups.No lag at all, I haven't rebooted the phone for weeks. bb10 is very efficient in recycling memory so no matter how heavy user you are, the phone will perform flawlessly all the time. I have 5 emails set up, 3 social network account set up. i get about 50 emails per day and over 200 texts message.There is so much to say on this phone! you wont regret it.",2013年3月23日 在美国审核

"Great functionality, but unacceptable battery performance","I am keeping this short, as I in principle agree with most of the praise sung in the five star reviews.However, I find pitifully misengineered and simply unacceptable the device's power performance. Instead of the 13 days standby / 10 hours talk time I get barely 12 hours of standby and half an hour of phone conversation, before the battery is completely drained. I have already exchanged the battery once, thus it really seems to be the device itself.I have seen that this problem is discussed frequently in online forums, and am a bit amazed that no-one brought it up in the Amazon reviews... I will exchange the device and hope that I will be back with a better rating afterwards. For now the Z10 takes you back to the stone age of mobile devices, when anything above 10 hours was a small miracle...If anyone could share their experience with battery life I would be grateful. It would be reassuring to know that in principle the device has a decent battery performance, and mine just a bad specimen... Thx.",2013年4月10日 在美国审核
Best phone I've ever owned,"This phone is amazing! It is literally a joy to use.I bought the Z10 as a replacement for my Nexus 4, which was a good phone, and I was still blown away by this thing. Most of the important apps are either on the Z10, coming soon, or have really decent web apps that you can make desktop shortcuts for. Anyways, the screen is the best I have ever seen on a mobile device, and that includes the iPhone 5. Color saturation is on par with the iPhone 5 screen, sharpness is slightly higher on the Z10 (Z10 has higher pixel density), and the auto brightness is by far better than anything on the market! It actually adjusts brightness while you're using the device, not just when you first turn on the screen (as is the case for the iPhone 5, and Nexus 4). The interface is super smooth, the keyboard is by far the best on the market (and I've used Swype, Swift Key, and stock iOS 6/JB 4.2 keyboards), the speaker is actually loud, not just called a ""loudspeaker."" The battery lasts 150-200% what my Nexus 4 lasted! Anyways, if I were to list all the things I love about this phone, it would be a much longer review than I'd like, so I'll start with some negatives. App selection is DEFINITELY not on par with iOS/Android, so if you go in with that expectation, you'll be sorely disappointed. Google Account integration is not as good as on Android (obviously). For example, you need to employ workarounds to get multiple calendars from your account to show up on the device. There are also a few minor quirks in the OS, that I'm sure will be addressed in the future (ex. The Hub not resetting to the top when you leave it, so doing a peak gesture when you get a notification just shows you what you were doing last, and you have to close that to see the notification. Obviously, finishing off what you were doing is a simple way of avoiding that situation).Anyways, I'm sure you can see that I've rated it 5 stars. In comparison, my Nexus 4 received 3 stars. It is safe to say that I am absolutely in love with this phone, and have been *very* pleasantly surprised as I had been a huge RIM (Blackberry) detractor in the past. In fact, I only got the Z10 to show people that I rationally dislike RIM, and not just talk without having used their products. Well, I stand corrected. I ended up selling my Nexus 4 after a week of owning the Z10 :)",2013年2月18日 在美国审核

Incredible!!! so like that in one week -185 dollars, I received then 562 wich is below what I should have and also below the price to buy a new one, I have to ad extra money for another one!!!I sent a lot of emails and they are rude, not helpfull and they just want to still people!!!I filed a A to Z claim and surprisingly they didn""t not said to Amazon that it was because of the battery but the restoring fee.Amazon denied my claim!! total BS!Amazon did a crapy job also in this situation.

Groundbreaking. You will never accept anything less.,"I've owned and used Droid Incredible, Note 1, S3, iPhone 4s, multiple Windows phones. But, I don't have to use every phone ever made to know that Z10 is the best phone available.I'm so thoroughly enamored with BB10 after only one week of using it. I have an S3 through Verizon, but I bought a Z10 from Canada because I couldn't wait any longer. When I have to use my S3, I find it clumsy and slow and I'm not talking processor speed. I'm talking about the user interface (UI) I am constantly phantom swiping, then I realize I have to look for buttons/keys, etc. Why should I have to look around click the 'back' arrow a dozen times to get out of an app? Swipe up, it's minimized. Tap the 'X' if I've the urge, to close the app. I have 4, 6, 8 open at times with NO performance penalty.And how could I have possibly tolerated such an archaic method of communication as Android? I used to excitedly show my iPhone friends the notification center, and the tweeks of the notification center. Hahaha! Who, after using a BB10 device for a week or two, will ever accept anything less than the Hub? Here's my life to this point...closing the app I am in, opening the app that has the communication interaction (text, FB, LinkedIn, etc), responding in that app, closing that app, then finding and reopening the original app I was in? Serious? How much better is the Hub than anything else available? Infinitely better. Swipe up and over, respond without opening any other apps or closing the app you were in, return. Never again will I settle for anything less efficient.The virtual keyboard? Wow...I never thought I would love something as much as my brief encounter with the Bold 9930 physical keyboard, but this is nothing short of amazing. Stunning in look, feel, accuracy. It's beautiful and efficient and I love it. It even sounds amazing. I'm so fast and accurate and it has to be because of BB, because my fat thumbs aren't any more nimble when I use the S3.The browser? It SMOKES my S3's browser. I don't even understand how it can be as fast as it is? Why are Android and iPhone browsers so slow? And they have the address bar inconveniently located at the top?Compare it to any browser on any platform. The videos are out there to PROVE it, but actually using it yourself is spectacular.Yes, every week another droid comes out with great specs and more cores, but it's the same thing over and over. It's the same clumsy, slow, inefficient UI. NO security. SPECS DON'T MAKE IT A BETTER PHONE! All it does is makes an impressive stat sheet. Do stat sheets make your day better? Does it make your life easier to have more cores? Is that what you begged for in your next phone?Yes, BB doesn't have all the apps yet. They will build them.But, it's OS is something none of the others will have...ever.Google and Apple know they are behind now. Their browser and keyboard are woeful in comparison.And they have NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO 'Hub' and 'Balance.' Who would like to argue that? The the gesture based UI? I guess, that is a personal preference, and you could argue it, but try it for a couple weeks and then pick up the others. Wow, could they be any less elegant?Android and iOS will have to steal the 'Hub' and 'Balance'. They will have to patch sloppy hack code onto an OS that was built to play apps. For BB10 the OS was built with those things at it's heart. Security, communication, separation of work/play were afterthoughts for them. If Android and iOS have to copy many key components of BB10 OS....who is behind who? What is a better phone?

"NO WiFi calling, Expansive Int'l email prices. good by BB","bought this phone from t-mobil at 16615B dove canyon Rd, San diago store on April 30th, 2013. They had NO clue about the Z10 and how it operates or any changes that took place when compared to 9900 or 9300. OK, this Z10, doesn't have WiFi calling like the BB 9900 which i bought 18 months ago!!! this phone never worked and was found defective after 8 hours of runaround between the store and T-mobile customer service. They changed my phone to another Z10 and $50.00 compensation for the poor service they provided. Next I received a call from T-mobile advising that my $20.00 plan to cover International email is no longer available for the Z10 AND T-mobile will be charging me $15/ MB??? so, in this case, why do i need a blackberry? the reason why I carried Blackberry phone is because it saved me money when i received my emails while traveling internationally. Now, Samsung &amp; IPHONE seem better to have considering that AT&amp;T has better rate per MB and I can buy international plan for much lesser than t-moble. T-mobile customer service changed their word on this issue 4 times from one person to another and I still never received straight word on the true story regarding email.So, to make my life easier, i decided to return the phone (the customer service person at the above store actually wanted to charge me $50.00 restocking fee). Additionally, the sadly changing customer service at T-mobile (from good to terrible customer service), is another encouragement to move forward with Iphone and another provider once my contract expires.",2013年5月16日 在美国审核

Worst phone ever!!!,"I got this phone to replace my bberry bold. Terrible mistake. Here's the truth about all of it: they took away what was already great like the classic ring tone for the messenger, it doesn't have it anymore, they took away the easy access to the profiles, now it's really complicated to go from silent to normal to loud, etc. You can only access your email from the hub, there's no icon for email anymore. If your in your emails it's really complicated to use the touch screen and try to use the search sender, or search subject, etc. There's no way of turning off the predicitive text, it will change your words anyway. If you want to correct a word, it has the magnifying glass like the iphone, but it doesn't work, because it moves right on top of the letter, so you can't really see where you are. If you have an alarm set in the clock, it will only work if the phone is on, if the phone is turned off the alarm won't turn on at the time the alarm is set. The software for the internet which was supposed to be better, is still the same, there's no improvement there. You can't choose to sync with Mac whether you want to sync with entourage or your mac calendar or contacts, it does it through your email. The only thing good is the screen, it has better resolution, but that doesn't make it worthnit at all! Don't waste your money. Most of my friends have iphone, there's only 3 of us left with bberry, the 3 of us got the z10, we all hated it, one returned it and kept his old bberry curve, the other one kept it and also got an iphone, I hate it.

Skip this phone locked APN,"Avoid buying this phone if you need to use prepaid cards. The APN is locked and you can't access the internet. What a pain! Blackberry support is just awful.

Why can Samsung, Apple get it right and Blackberry who was very late to get the Z10 to market not fix this problem. Many people are complaining about the locked APN (grayed out).

Not really a business device,"I feel like blackberry removed some of the most critical tools I used for business.Probably the most important thing for me was being able to do a very granular email search.I could type a name in the name field and a keyword in the message field.That search was replaced with what IOS uses which is either searching a subject OR all fields OR the message field.I've never found these kinds of searches as useful.I also noticed that by maybe the forth email down in a series of threaded communications, the column width was reduced to a a single character making it unreadable.I even noticed one email I sent looked completely normal on my screen, but showed up in a large blue font for the recipient.If blackberry can fix the email issues and debug the OS, I think they'll have a fantastic device.But that's like saying if that guy wasn't poor, sick, and stupid, he'd make a great husband.I mean email is the reason blackberry exists in the first place so I think if they broke email, there's no limit to what else might be broken.",2013年3月25日 在美国审核

Outstanding at the current sale price!,"This is an excellent deal and value at the current 30 dollar price.Without activation, it can serve as a camera, a GPS, an MP3 player, a mini-tablet, e-reader, web browser (limited), and so on. I had no trouble using it right out of the box without any updates. So you could just use it that way if so inclined. I did two updates after playing around, first the basic 8.0 update to prepare for the 8.1, and then the Windows 8.1 update itself.The first took only about 10-15 minutes, the second over an hour (be very patient and do not rush it).However, once done, everything is working fine and there are a few new features (like being able to turn off the haptic feedback [the vibrate when you press a button feature]).A big plus, in my opinion, is the FREE Nokia Music app which provides great music for free with no ads. For 30 bucks, it would be worth buying just for this, in my opinion.The sound quality is very good - over headphones or via Bluetooth speaker(s). And, of course, you can pop in a micro-SD card with all your own MP3's as well.Nice!The app itself will let you save music offline (limited to 4 mixes in free version, unlimited mixes for 3.99 a month) as well. Neat!The GPS is excellent as well and the HERE driving app is good if not great.The maps and routes are excellent, but the features are limited in other areas. But, hey, a GPS for 30 bucks that also is an mp3 player?Cool!(It picks up satellites very well and works great, but you need wifi to set it up. Once that's done, it can guide you offline. Still learning it.) (Update: It has worked very well on local trips. It incldues a speed limit feature and you wil hear two tones if you exceed the speed limit. This worked well and was very accurate. Could save you from getting a ticket which would more than pay for this thing.)The screen is excellent. Everything works fine. Camera is OK. Plenty of apps in my opinion.Another big plus for me is that I already have an older AT&amp;T GoPhone, so I can switch my phone service to this if I wish (I have not yet, because I'm happy with my old phone. Great battery life and a pop-out keyboard which I prefer). Battery life is good (not great, but good).All in all, if you are the do-it-yourself type - this is an outstanding toy to fool around with. And the GoPhone packages are very reasonable. I have been very happy with my older GoPhone and the service has always been fine. I highly recommend this at the current low price.2014-12-25 Update: Gave two of these as Christmas gifts and both people loved them.Both plan to actually activate them as phones.Plenty of good, low cost plans available. I continue to be impressed by the quality and great features of this phone. Hard to beat at these fire-sale prices!2015-01-04 Update: There is plenty of good info in earlier reviews on setup, but the key points are - when you turn on the phone go into settings and turn on ""Airplane Mode"" right away - then put in the SIM card and (optional, but recommended) micro-SD card for added storage and set-up your various accounts (optional) and do updates as preferred.Setting up the free Nokia account is a good idea. And you'll want to download the maps (free) for the GPS. You can't touch this for the price. A truly great deal.",2014年12月5日 在美国审核

Great smartphone at a low price that just works!!,"A few words before I begin: I USED to be an Android user and I've tried an iPhone but didn't ""feel the love"" there either.About 2.5 years ago, I got hired by a firm that issued me my first Windows Phone; I had no choice in the matter. I was a die-hard Android fan and was displeased at the prospect of giving up my ""preferred"" platform......until I sat down and actually USED it.I got this phone as my personal device the other day and it's been a gem like the other 2 Windows Phones I've had. So what if it doesn't have a 100-megapixel camera, 32-core processor, 64 GB of RAM, etc....my point is that Windows Phone doesn't NEED all that hardware to run properly (except for the camera if your only camera is your phone, but you can get a better camera with other Nokia models ;)).Windows Phone doesn't come with TouchWhizz, MotoBlunder, HTC NonSense or any of that other bloatware, and runs very well without that stuff bogging it down like it does with most Android devices. Windows Phone isn't twitchy, touchy or glitchy like Android and doesn't have thousands of non-sensical unvetted garbage apps that don't work properly either (or conflict with the operating system). I haven't had any issues with my Windows phones acting like they're possessed (i.e. starting stuff up on theirown without user intervention), haven't had to restart my phone because of a misbehaving app, and haven't had to pull the battery because it's frozen up.....EVER. My Windows phones have just worked, period, without fuss, and this one's no exception. Windows phones get their updates directly from Microsoft, without having to go through the manufacturer and carrier first. All Windows Phones operate the same; no learning curve when you switch phones. Best of all, they're as easy to use as an iPhone, and can be a whole lot cheaper.Windows Phone also comes with some nice features built-in that would need to be downloaded on an Android phone via the Play Store. A mobile version of Microsoft Office is preinstalled, so no downloading ThinkFree Office to view or edit your Word and Excel files. Bing search includes a song-identification feature and barcode/QR code scanner; no need to download SoundHound or barcode scanner apps, as on an Android device. When you register your Windows Phone on windowsphone.com using your Windows Live (hotmail.com, live.com or outlook.com) account, you're able to view the content of your SkyDrive--pictures and documents (7 GB free storage for as long as you have your Windows Live account) from any computer connected to the internet. If you lose your phone, you can find it via GPS, make it ring, lock it, or erase the contents of the phone all from the windowsphone.com site. Again, all this is BUILT IN; no need to go download a bunch of apps to get that functionality. If you don't have a Windows Live account, you can create one using your existing email account if you want. Microsoft doesn't force you to get a Hotmail email address like Google forces you to get a Gmail address for Android phones. Syncing your music and pictures with your Windows 7/8 or Macintosh computer is a snap; no ""drag and drop,"" it automatically downloads your pictures into your pictures folder and you can choose what music you want to sync and it happens automatically.One built-in app that's worth special mention is ""Local Scout."" For travelers, this can be a lifesaver. Local Scout uses your phone's GPS to tell you what's near you, like restaurants, attractions, and places to shop. All you have to do is to tap on a business or attraction name and you can navigate to that business or attraction, call them, add them to your favourites and more, without leaving the app.I guess what I'm saying is that if you want something as a playtoy and don't mind the fragmentation, frustration, glitches, force-closes, and misbehaving apps, then by all means, go get that 100-megapixel, 32-core, 64 GB RAM Android phone....it's gonna need all that hardware! However, if you want something that is useful, has a lot of built-in features, easy, doesn't fuss or fight with you, is fluid and smooth, and just plain works, then get a Windows Phone. If you want a great Windows Phone on a budget, get this one. It won't disappoint you.Edit: It's been a few weeks since I've bought this device for personal use and it still runs like a champ. Recently, I had to switch my work device to a Galaxy S3 and this Nokia runs rings around the GS3, even though the GS3 has a better processor and 4 times the RAM. As soon as work is over, the GS3 gets put away and I switch back to my Nokia 520, and I'm happy again. I get 3 days out of this Nokia; the GS3 won't last a day without charging it.Second Edit (6/7/2014): I downloaded the developer preview for Windows Phone 8.1 on this device and it works beautifully. Yes, great things are coming to Windows Phone, as the general release for WP 8.1 won't be out until summertime. WP 8.1 brings a notification bar that you can swipe down, showing missed calls, emails and texts, as well as toggle switches for wi-fi, bluetooth, airplane mode and screen rotation; you can also set a background wallpaper that shows through your live tiles; and the most important feature......CORTANA! Yes, Cortana, Microsoft's answer to Siri (Cortana works a whole lot better too) is even available for use on the ""lowly"" Nokia 520. You have to be a US resident for Cortana to work in the developer preview, no word yet if Cortana will be available outside the US in the official WP 8.1 release. Cortana even understands some sequential requests.....something Siri can't do. I put her up against Siri on an iPhone 5S and Cortana outperformed Siri by a comfortable margin.Budget-minded fans take note: When Windows Phone 8.1 comes out this summer, you'll have the best features at an off-contract price that can't be beat. There's no reason, except for FUD about the Windows Phone platform, to own an Android or iPhone anymore now :D.Third edit (2/4/2015): According to Microsoft, Cortana is available in several regions now outside the US, so if you live outside the US, give it a go, especially in UK and Australia. Windows Phone 8.1 will also be upgradable to Windows 10 when it's released, thereby unifying the experience across multiple devices.Fourth edit (3/23/2016): Microsoft announced on 6/17/2016 that only a select few devices will be upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile, and this one isn't going to get the upgrade. The only x2x series device that will get the official upgrade is the Lumia 1520. Having used Windows 10 on a Lumia 920 before, I can say that going from 8.1 to 10 on a low-end device would be totally frustrating. The 920 lagged such that I noticed it, especially switching between apps and launching the Windows Store, camera, and Cortana. It was still usable and that was due to the fact that the 920 has 1 GB RAM. The 520 only has 512 MB RAM, so I wouldn't advise doing the upgrade on this phone. Given that, to upgrade, go to insider.windows,com and register as a Windows 10 mobile insider, download the Windows Insider app on your phone, launch the app and login with your Microsoft account, and then select the ""Release Candidate"" ring. Then, go to settings and check for updates.A word of caution: Once you upgrade the device to Windows 10, you can't go back to Windows Phone 8.x. Conceivably, one could restore the device using the Nokia Recovery Tool or the Windows Device Recovery Tool, but that route hasn't been successful for me.",2014年1月11日 在美国审核
Perfect for an old curmudgeon like myself and an amazing bargain!,"My wife and I are 77 and resisted owning or using cell phones until just last year when we bought one to use as a ""travel phone."" We signed-up with Consumer Cellular (phone only) and bought a very, very cheap flip phone. She's had problems using with the basic flip phone and so, when I saw this one for only $30 (along with the great reviews) I grabbed one. Putting it into service was as simple as removing the slick little sim card from the flip phone, snapping the micro sim (already performated for this purpose) and putting it in the 520. Nothing to it!Frankly, I haven't told her about it yet but, after updating the firmware and the GPS maps, I'm mightily impressed and reasonably certain she'll find it a snap to use. I'm a Linux desktop user and left Windows behind years ago but the integration of Windows 8.1 into this thing is impressive. The more I use it the more impressed I am! My Consumer Cellular plan doesn't include data but I can cruise the internet free via wireless (plenty of hotspots around). After downloading the GPS maps I can use them off-line, a plus for me. My wife's SUV has a Garmin 7"" GPS that she would never part with and I needed one for my old Chevy. The 520 will do nicely.The bottom-line: If you're an old coot like me I believe you'll love the 520 and, for only $29.95, it's a steal!old arkiedanAddendum on December 27: When the Lumia 520 went on further sale a couple days ago I grabbed another one.

I like this better than the Android platform as far as ...,"I like this better than the Android platform as far as general usability. The new voice assistant seems to work well, it does everything I did with Siri on my iPhone, but the Windows app need smoothing out still and most of your favorite apps may not yet be on the platform. The phone seems well built, solid buttons, and I prefer this smaller and thinner size in a phone.For 30 dollars though you can't beat this little thing. I'm not using the cell function right now, but as a piece of technology it's a great deal and I suspect it would make a good phone. I like the touchpad as much or more than my iPhone 4s and far more than my old Android. My problem with Android phones is the lack of consistent interface and workflow coupled with bloatware from phone makers, otherwise Android seems to have the devs and app support that I would want.The speaker is LOUD, so this thing makes a great MP3 player or even cheap portable mini room system. It's way loud enough to hear in a room and even loud enough in the shower. Not sure how fast the wifi is, but everything seems fairly snappy overall with the phone.I think I like MS's email app better than anything in iphone or android, their office apps are cool looking, not sure I need them, but pretty nice. The tiles work great for mobile platforms, not sure why they smeared the metro interface so badly by forcing it on desktop users. For no reason I can explain the virtual keyboard works better for me than the iphone and I make less typos, though auto suggest still needs improvement as it does on all platforms.The single biggest flaw for me is the App view being a single row, that's a pretty big flaw, but yeah for 30 dollars I can deal with it. I wanted to try a Windows 8 phone so this gave me the opportunity to own one on the cheap.Even as an mp3 player alone this thing blow away everything else on the market at 30 dollars, plus it's a full fledged smart phone AND has GPS and offline maps. It also has a built in FM tuner. I have certainly not tested all the features or longevity.As a little compact computer this thing rocks. I can't really comment on it as a phone, but if MS keeps improving this platform and gets apps I'll probably make my next actual smart PHONE an MS based one.",2014年12月3日 在美国审核
I really like it,"Nokia always made incredible phones in terms of hardware and software and I was really sorry to see them lose market share to the point of going out of business.Nokia voice quality beats anything that is out there on the market today. Microsoft's purchase has kept them alive and this is an incredible piece of hardware for the price.As many have noted, although AT&amp;T won't like to publicize it, this phone can be operated without a Sim card.You won't be able to make phone calls or get cellular data, but it is an incredible value as a Wi-Fi only tablet, music player, real GPS with GPS chip device, email reader, camera and so much more.Insertable Sim card, replaceable battery, it's great. Given the choice between spending $600 to $900on an iPhone or $25 on this, the decision was easy for me.The only issue with this phone is Microsoft and their updates. The actual OS is fine and reasonably intuitive. However, when I plugged this phone in, it updated itself to Windows 8.1, which just like a PC easily took a couple of hours.I then downloaded maps for the entire United States for the GPS app, and that took nearly 4 hours.iOS and android Devices do not operate like PCs in this weird Microsoft your time has no value way.Now that the phone is up and running, it is amazing and I would highly recommend it.If you want to save some money, want a really good phone which wont cause you to have a heart attack if you drop and crack it, and also have a day's time to waste, this phone, along with it's more expensive siblings, is a great value.",2014年12月24日 在美国审核
Wow,"This phone is an amazing value.It features excellent build quality and a great no contract price.I happen to have a contract with AT&amp;T and I simply put my sim card in this phone and I was up and running.It doesn't do LTE speeds, but the faux 4G is good enough.Windows Phone gets a bad rap for lack of apps, and in some cases it is true.There is no Google support, so if you use Google Voice, you have to do it in the browser.Gmail can be checked with the built-in email client.Other than the lack of Google support, most of the big name apps I use are there.I'm missing Nest, but I can also do that in the browser.If you want to, you can pin webpages, such as Google Voice or Nest to the Start screen and they essentially act as apps (albeit in the browser).This phone is fast enough.It isn't lacking in speed, as Windows Phone is seemingly optimized for Microsoft's minimum requirements.You'll see it repeated in tech blogs and videos, and it is true.Windows Phone feels the same no matter if you are on a 1Ghz dual-core processor (like this phone) or the more expensive models, which are 1.5 Ghz dual-core.The new 1520 is a quad-core 2.2Ghz.It will be interesting to see if a quad-core 2.2 Ghz processor makes a difference.Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by the entire package here.It has enough speed, a very nice screen, and (mostly) all of the apps I use for an incredible price.It also feels very comfortable in-hand.If you are curious about Windows Phone, this is the perfect phone.If you are on a budget, this is the perfect phone.If you need a backup phone, this is the perfect phone.No wonder this phone owns about 30% of the Windows Phone market (at the time of this writing).",2013年11月29日 在美国审核
Snappier than my Samsung S3,"Jan 10 2015 updateI have completed the update / customization of the phone. The process was very easy and trouble-free. It is now running Windows 8.1. Response remains snappy, so performance has not changed. Transferring pictures and music from PC to the phone was again simple. The Samsung Kies is big &amp; slow and, worse, sometimes could not find my S3. I am really beginning to think my next major phone upgrade will be a Windows phone instead of Android. In addition, my wife's S4 is slighter faster but the cost was 10X that of my 520. I just realized that I fell into the trap of buying brand name.The original reason for getting this phone was for the GPS and downloadable maps. It finds the best route very fast, again faster than my S3. The best thing is that the screen will not blank out when navigation was working. The S3 screen will blank out, making it not very useful. I have a Garmin GPS, but the map is out of date, I probably will not buy a replacement but use this Windows phone instead.In summary, this is an extremely under-valued phone that deserves recognition. I now rate it 5 stars instead of 4.Origina reviewI already have a Samsung S3 but was really intrigued by the Map and navigation functions of this Nokia phone. At this low price, I bought it just to play with. And this is my first Windows phone BTW.The Samsung looks fancier and has a smoother touch surface. This Nokia is smaller. However, it is fast and very responsive. Checking emails and surfing web were faster than the S3 by a large margin. Setting the phone up was just as easy as Android; I am quite used to Windows 8.1 as I have 2 Windows tablets.Overall, my initial impression is very positive.",2015年1月8日 在美国审核
Great Little Phone,"This is a really nice little phone. I have been thru several Nokia smart phones over the years. Never did get into the Iphone or Galaxy thing. I always preferred to stay out of contract on my postpaid att plan. I had recently gone back to an old Razr.I got this phone in and realized that my old mini sim would not fit so off to the nearest ATT store. They quickly transferred everything to a micro sim and I was out of there in 15 minutes. No problem using it on my postpaid off contract plan. Doesn't have to be used on a prepaid account.Screen is nice, touch response is wonderful. GPS is absolutely awesome. So much faster to lock and navigate than any Garmin or other phone I have every owned. The Windows OS is excellent. Go ahead and upgrade to 8.1 because Cortana is great. You will love her. She knows everything.I had only 1 con but it has been fixed. And that was battery life. It was horrible, something like 12 hours in standby. It was ridiculous. Even after turning off what I thought were all the apps running in the background, wifi, location, etc., it still wouldn't last.Then I discovered a few other apps I had missed AND I intentionally ran the battery down until the phone died. Charged it back up completely and the battery life is normal again. I am getting a solid 24 to 36 hours while playing with phone constantly. So I believe that running the battery down fixed that issue. Don't know anything about it but found it as a suggestion by other folks on the internet and it did work for me. So try it if you have a battery life issue.Bought this for 29.99 and liked it so much that I ordered another one for a backup when they went on lightning deal for 19.99.

Why Did I Ever Buy an Ipod Touch 5?,"Why didn't I know about this smartphone earlier? I spent $350 on an iPod Touch that doesn't, of course, even have a phone (and I dislike the constant bloatware and cookies Apple forces you to ""upgrade"" to with iTunes).This was under $50! You can use it as a mini-computer (the non-phone part of ""smartphone"") at any wifi access point. I have an old fashioned cell phone and may use this as a backup phone. It is great to have the flexibility this offers--prepaid, no contract, no data plan required. If I don't use the phone feature, it still is a very nice 5 MP camera (and it has some ""creative filters"" that are fun, and of course video). The internet connection was fast and smooth. It is very easy to use and easy to read horizontally. There aren't a lot of adjustable settings, but they are easy to use.[ETA 9.27.14. Lost ""one star"" in the review because I decided not to use it as a smartphone for now, but I still wanted to use as an MP3 player, etc. It turns out, that to transfer anything from my PC to the Nokia--like, for example, music--requires an app. And to get that, I have to put in or create an email account, then give them my phone number! I really do NOT think that should be necessary just to transfer information back and forth.

"Great bargain -- solid performer for very, very little cash!","Whether you use it as an AT&amp;T smartphone or as a Super iPod Touch Killer (I'm in the latter category, and use Skype for phone calls), this little phone is one of the bargains of the century.At $30 (or so), it has a nice quick processor and a display which has plenty of resolution for a 4"" screen (... after all, who needs multi-thousand pixels when the screen is relatively tiny, and the pixels wouldn't be resolved by your eye in any case!).I was particularly surprised by how neatly the Windows 8.0 (and 8.1, to which I upgraded very soon after I got the unit online) worked -- the ability to pin, size, and position tiles for essentially all content elements (incl. browser favorites) to the home screen allows a user to customize the look and organization of the machine to meet individual needs very easily.Despite the fact that Windows Phones don't seem to be very popular, it's not at all clear why they're not much admired.The Lumia build quality, with a lot of plastic and not much metal, appears to be quite good in terms of fit and finish, and the components seem nicely matched to the operating system.Particularly impressive was the fact that the Lumia 520 seems quite content to download/upload content at very respectible speeds -- while my home DSL isn't exactly blazing at 10/0.7 Mbps download/upload speeds, the Lumia 520 keeps up with it and streams video without a hiccup which is more than I can say for some of the handhelds that I've encountered over the past couple of years.And the battery life is surprisingly good -- much better than most of the Android machines (from 2.3.5 through 4.4.2) that I've played with over the last year or so.The only downside I've seen is that the App Store is not as extensive as is the case for Apple and Android OS's, but this wasn't a big deal for me -- I only need a finite number of games and file managers and such, and wasn't upset that I have to get used to doing things a little differently.The Kindle app works like a Kindle app... IX works like IX...The GPS app directs you appropriately... And the multiple camera apps take pretty decent pictures (the panoramic camera was particularly surprising and effective)... And Cortana listens/understands pretty well -- but doesn't speak as much as I expected.And, did I mention... it's incredibly inexpensive/affordable:so I got a second one...",2015年2月16日 在美国审核
Good low cost phone or even just buy as an MP3 player on wifi only,"I bought this phone because it was really inexpensive. I had been searching for an MP3 player for my 6 year old. It is less expensive than even cheap MP3 players so I thought how could I go wrong... First of all, I have not used this as a phone so I cannot review the phone call reception or quality. I am using this connected to wifi only. It is very easy to load music on this phone. Just drag and drop your MP3 files. Plus the phone can be used to download apps. I found a tooth brushing app that times 3 or 4 minutes, so my daughter knows how long to brush. I also found candy crush and a couple other kids apps. My 6 year old has used the camera and video camera for fun and loves it. I spend some time looking at the software and honestly, this is a really good smart phone for the price. I am an iPhone 5S owner and I am happily giving this 5 stars, because when features are adjusted for price, this think costs a fraction of my iPhone does much of what my phone does. There are short cummings such as there is no front facing camera. The battery doesn't hold up great so you will need to charge it every night. The screen is much more reflective than my iPhone, which is annoying. Rear facing camera works poorly in low light and has no flash. Buy hey, the full price of this is 1/10 the subsidized price of my iPhone. If you are upgrading from a feature phone or want to get a low cost pay-as-you-go plan, this thing would be good. The Microsoft live tiles are nice - I think they are even better than IOS and Android because they use the screen space better and provide live updated information.",2015年1月26日 在美国审核
Great value and functionality,"My background...I've used webOs (palm pre), iOS (iPhone 3GS, 4), android (Nexus 4, 5), and now the windows 8 (Nokia Lumia 520). I'm now on a prepaid plan (Straight Talk) and won't go back to a contract. I am a techie, and have used many desktop OS's as well (OSx, win 95, 2000, xp, Vista, 7 &amp; 8, ubuntu, unix, etc). I bought this as a backup phone to my Nexus 5.What is good about this phone?+ inexpensive (I paid fifty dollars without a contract)+ decent battery life+ good, crisp display+ live tiles update clearly+ removable/replaceable battery+ micro SD card can expand memoryWhat is bad about this phone?- Windows Phone 8 isn't as refined an OS as iOS or Android (e.g. the resizing of tiles/icons is somewhat limited vs Android's widgets; and iOS is still the most intuitive OS on the market)- Small catalog of Windows Phone apps is missing some ""basic"" ones (e.g. no Feedly, no alternative English keyboards such as Swiftkey, ...)- Unified inbox for email is quirky and not intuitive- no front camera (if you need selfies and/or video calls)What is good or bad depending on who's asking?= smaller screen, but not so small you can't see things= small amount of standard memory (for those who install videos or tons of songs; for business folks it isn't as much an issue)This is a good phone for you if you:1. Want a starter smartphone2. Are looking for a backup smartphone3. Have limited requirements for functionality4. Are looking to spend a small amount and get good value5. Are looking for a way to tiptoe into Windows Phone 86. Don't want to cry if you lose it or break it",2013年12月20日 在美国审核
I'm so impressed with this phone!,"I bought this phone to use as a cheap MP3 player, over bluetooth, in the car.With the ability to use a 64GB Micro SD card for storage, I could download my entire music collection plus some!Once I got it, I had to play with it for a while.The Windows Phone OS is easy to navigate and use, much easier than Windows 8 for desktop.The touchscreen is accurate.The processor is capable and pretty fast.The app store is lacking but all of the major social media and multi-media apps are available.I can imagine that if this was my only device, I could get by with it just fine.I use this phone as a wi-fi only device.Similar to an iPod Touch.I have no intention of activating this device for cell phone service.Overall, I'm very impressed with the hardware and software considering the price it is.Update:I wanted to see if I could use this phone for wi-fi phone calls without cell service.I found that with the Skype app, I can make wi-fi calls for about three cents per minute ($0.03/per min) with no commitment or expiration on Skype credits.If I wanted to, for $5/mo, I could get a phone number from Skype and take incoming phone calls via Skype.Test calls were successful and sounded good.Update:Microsoft promises that this phone will update to Windows 10 when it comes out!I just gets better and better!",2014年10月31日 在美国审核
Cheap and lasted me 3 years,"I have had this phone for 3 years. Considering it was about $40 when I got it, lasting 3 years says a lot about this phone. I only got a new phone because it started having charging issues. Anyways, it really is a great phone. It is easy to sync it to all your windows items (I had my phone, PC, and 2 laptops synced) and also has a great camera. It is NOT dual camera though, only back camera, which didn't bother me much, but could easily annoy people that like to take a lot of selfies. I do recommend a SD card if you plan on having a lot of pictures, videos, or music, as the operating system takes up 3/4 of the space on the phone. The music plays pretty well though whether through headphones or without. The battery life is not bad, will get you through most of the day as long as you are not constantly on it (like any phone). The only thing I did not like about this phone is the app store. It uses windows store and a lot of the time the apps don't work on the phone or I can't find what I need. So if you are wanting a phone that can play a lot of games and use a lot of apps (doesn't have Instagram, Snapchat, and more of the popular ones that you use with Android, etc.) this is not the phone for you. The customization options are awesome. It's the first phone I have ever had that has this many customization options. I do recommend a case for this! It's a thin phone and without a case may break easily. I have always kept a case and screen protector on it and never broken the screen or anything (even with 2 toddlers). What other $40 phone can you get that will last you years? If you find one, let me know. :)",2016年2月2日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price-works perfect for my needs!,"Absolutely LOVE!!!I purchased this as a replacement for my Fusion, that my son decided to give a bath in the back of his tractor that he dumped his juice in.It is extremely easy to navigate, although it took some getting used to (as it always does with new phones).I am on the Go-Phone AT&amp;T plan, and had no issues switching over from another phone to this one.This phone does use a small SIM card, and the Fusion had a large one, so going to the AT&amp;T store to get the phone to work with the smaller SIM card was necessary.Although I wasn't exactly thrilled about that, the sales people in the store were extremely friendly, and very helpful.The Internet Connection isn't my favorite, but it does work so I can't complain.Have no issues whatsoever with calls/texts.The phone doesn't have many choices for backgrounds, but this isn't an issue for me since I usually just use a picture I take for a background anyway.Speaking of pictures, the phone has an excellent camera.It has the shutter feature, and you can even edit pictures in many ways.Overall, really glad I purchased this phone.No, its not an iPhone by any means, but I honestly wouldn't know the difference, andusually only use my phone for calls and texts-so this suits me just fine.Unless you feel as if you need all the bells and whistles that come with extremely expensive phones (and usually more expensive contracts) then this is the phone for you.Note-I'm not sure if this is available in all areas, but I have the $45 a month plan for unlimited call, text, and 2GB of data a month.I purchase the card at wal mart, but you can buy more cards at a time and it will go to your balance....just something I do, but before I got on the ""wal mart plan' the same plan was $60 a month.Not sure why it is so much cheaper to go through wal mart.Will definitely purchase again if needed.Also, amazon also has some really cute cases for this phone in case that is something you are interested in : )Hannah",2014年11月21日 在美国审核
the screen resolution and user experience was pleasant and easy to use Windows OS,"Requirements: -Needed a phone to bridge the gap between when my old phone broke and my contract expired. -Didn't want to spend a lot of money -Didn't want to go back to using a flip phone for 2 monthsFirst Glance: -The phone came in one of those anti theft packaging and was a bit of a pain to open -The phone came with a new sim that I could probably use later on for.. whatever reason -First boot, the screen resolution and user experience was pleasant and easy to useWindows OS: -I've had nokia phones in the past, but this was the first windows based phone I've ever used.The phone has some nice UI features that make sense, and some that dont.If you're not stuck up about which OS is more superior, I would recommend giving the windows OS a try.You may be pleasantly surprised.Camera: -It comes with a lower end 5mp camera.Nokia is known for having stronger cameras than most phones in that price range.High light scenarios, I think any camera would do well, but this one is excellent.Low light, all cameras struggle; this one is no exception.Nice features: -External SD slot for up to 16 or 32 gigs extra? I'm not exactly sure -Long lasting battery! Since you wont be playing much games on this phone, the battery will last you a few days at least -The photo album is nice because it has some auto-generated slide shows playing in the background -The hardware is optimized for performance with the windows OS.There's no noticeable lag when flipping through images or whateverComplaints: -Hardware and Software: None really.This is a ""disposable"" smart phone.For $40, you are getting a LOT -Locked to AT&amp;T.You won't really be able to use this for TMobile or any other provider unless you find the unlock code, which is specific for each individual phone.Minimally, after you're done with it, you can leave it in the car for emergency 911 calls.Conclusion: -It's a good phone.If we weren't living in an age where phone companies are constantly pushing out newer and more amazing models, I might be satisfied with just sticking with this phone.It does everything an average user needs to do at a price that you will hardly ever feel.",2015年4月16日 在美国审核
"May not ever use it as a phone but like my new Windows ""toy"".","I'm not using this as a phone, it's my tiny Windows ""toy"". I have found by downloading all the maps for the US (I moved the maps to an SD card as I had no free space left!) I can use the maps without an internet connection on this phone, the main reason I wanted the phone. I saw my exact address on the map, street name and house number, when I first opened HERE app. I have no SIM card installed, never did install it. I had no WIFI connection when we were moving in the car and I had accurate locations on the map with points of interest noted as we drove.I can send text messages to cell phones via WIFI &amp; email just fine so that will do for communication.I transferred music, photos and all my contacts from my LG840g phone (the one I use as my ""real"" phone) via bluetooth using the free Transfer my Data app I installed.This phone is just the right size for my short fingers, it is light, easy on the eyes when in high contrast mode.I admit to spending hours playing card games on it already since that is comfortable to do as long as I'm kicked back in the recliner so my neck isn't strained. My tablet is just too big for comfortable armchair card game playing; it takes less hand and arm movement to play on this wee phone. For about $20 with a recent Amazon deal even my brother bought one of these phones. It has apps to be useful and more available you can install for free if you are good at ignoring the blinking ads. The phone is fun too and my ""dumb"" phone I use for the rare phone call isn't.Good volume on the external speaker and very nice sound listening to mp3s on headphones; had to turn the volume way way down for headphones.The camera is pretty darn good too even without a flash. This phone is so skinny, it's easy to wrap a finger around the edge and touch the screen when you don't mean to do that but I had that problem with my chunkier LG phone until I got a case for it.I'm happy so far!Update Feb 4, 2015. With this phone, although the camera isn't the greatest, I love being able to take a few shots and before I get into the room with the desktop computer, the photos have already been uploaded via WiFi to OneDrive/SkyDrive to view and edit.My Android tablets would still be uploading to Google Drive or Dropbox from past experience. I didn't have much use for OneDrive/SkyDrive until I got this phone. Still happy!",2014年12月28日 在美国审核
I Love My New Nokia Lumia 520!!!!,"Let me start off by saying this is my first smart phone so take that into consideration while reading this. The features are great to me and I love the windows!This is like using my computer so I found it easier than I expected. (Yes there is a learning curve but nowhere as bad as I expected). I can put what I want (pin) the applications or take off what I won't be using so I won't have a cluttered screen. I also can make them smaller or larger and arrange any order I want.The camera is not the best but it is ok. I just wished it had a zoom although I did see an app for lenses but I never looked yet to see if there's a zoom in there. You also can take 'selfies' with it by using the 'Smart Shoot' icon which switches the camera part to a forward facing one (just don't ask where the lens is unless it is built under the screen, I haven't a clue.)I just love Cortana! When my bluetooth is on all I have to do is hit the button on it and ask her to give me the weather report, make a call, or even where there is a local fair is. (If you're not using a bluetooth just hit the icon and the mic and you can still do it by voice). She can also tell me what appointments I have on my calendar just by asking her. Nokia calls her something like 'your personal secretary' and to me, that is exactly what she is. (Did I mention she does this by voice, in other words I ask what is on my calendar for today and she says ""Today at 6:00 p.m. you have a grooming appointment for Sheila"".) I know there is more that she can do but I haven't used her for other things yet.The GPS I thought I'd never use sure came in handy one day when the road I normally take was closed and I had no ideal how to get to my appointment (it is not as simple as taking the next road or go around on the next block around here as the mountain roads don't work that way). It gave clear, easy to follow turn by turn directions and I found a new way to go.When we were on vacation, I loved the 'eat &amp; drink', 'see &amp; do', and 'shop' at my fingertips plus the maps. Not only could I use the driving directions but there are walking directions which really came in handy going from one site to another in a strange city.There are just some really great features I won't have room to go through them all plus the apps available but it is a phone after all so I should tell you the phone works great. It is clear and you have an assortment of ringtones to chose from.Now for the negative about the phone:Not all apps work on it so if you are coming from another smart phone and think you can just switch your apps and ringtones to this one, think again! Please be sure to check this part out first or you may be disappointed.I don't believe you can even put your own music/ringtones on it. Also, the loudest and best ringtones that are on the phone (there are quite a few to choose from) only rings 3 times. There is no way to make it ring longer so I ended up with a different one which rings longer but to this day I still am not use to it as it is more musical than 'ringing' and by the time I realize it isn't the radio, tv, or one of the baby's toys, I miss the call anyways. (I just want to mention I did see a ringtone app. but didn't check it out yet. There may be some ringing ones in there.)To me this is the biggest negative (but it may not be an issue to you) because of the design of the phone and the size of my hand (small). The natural way I hold the phone in my left hand, my index finger is where the volume button is and I end up turning it down so far that I can't even hear the phone (without knowing it). It has happened on several occasions. I wish the volume was either designed differently or placed at the top or bottom of the phone to eliminate this problem.So to sum it up, it is a fantastic phone for us who are just starting with smart phones but some of you more seasoned phone users may be disappointed with the restrictions/limits of what you can use/do on it. Me? I love it!!!*****update, after my phone was updated, I can no longer take selfies. It is now a rear facing camera only! Why on earth would they do that is beyond me.",2014年8月17日 在美国审核
Budget price with premium features. Excellent.,"This is an excellent choice for smartphone with a very low price. I bought this for my daughter after her iphone shattered into pieces after dropping it on the sidewalk. Her iphone was in a case too.That was the second time I have seen an iphone shatter and it gives me more reason to never want one.Nokia phones are typically very well made and very durable. For many, many years I was strictly a Nokia user. In the past few years I opted to try Samsung Galaxy and am currently using the S5 Active. While I love my Samsung, my heart still lies with Nokia due to the great quality and construction. My husband uses Nokia 920, which is built like a brick and he loves it. It is great if you need something that is safe to bang around in your pocket and withstand falls etc. He works in construction so he needs something very sturdy. I have seen him drop that phone on more than one occasion and it has never suffered any damage, even without a case on it.This Nokia 520 isn't made quite as solid, but it is still durable. I feel like the battery cover is a bit flimsy, but overall otherwise it is a solid phone.As for features, it has everything you need to make it useful and can be used on wifi only as a small tab, etc. - you don't have to have a sim card or any service plan to use it.It is fast, has a decent amount of memory, and call quality is excellent. Screen is beautiful and well made - it is where the weight of the phone comes from.The only downfall is that it only has one camera, so if you are a selfie queen, you might be a bit disappointed. Otherwise, it is a great phone. All of the features you need and want, without spending hundreds of dollars. I would recommend this phone to anyone who doesn't mind not having the second camera. It is an excellent replacement phone as well, if like us you need something cheap due to lost/stolen/broken phones.My daughter has not complained about anything except he lack of second cam. Battery life is good too, which is essential as she texts virtually non-stop. 20 thousand+ texts per month! Plus internet usage, of course.",2015年1月9日 在美国审核
"Great for those that like Windows, great backup for those who don't.","Great (especially for the price) backup phone if your phone goes out and you're not quite able to upgrade. That said, Windows Phones I guess are a love it or hate it kind of thing. I've used Iphones and currently use an android so I can do a pretty level job of comparing the features. First off, the basic phone stuff, call, text, it does fine, no complaints. The interface is a little busy, especially compared to other phones. All the little 'windows' give it a 'too much is going on' appearance. And there were two different navigation windows on there, xbox live, and a few others. If you're totally integrated into everything, all these shortcuts can be great. If you're not, it's wasted space. There is most definitely a learning curve on this phone and will take a bit of playing around with it before you are comfortable, moreso than witha n iphone or android device, which still took time. The huge HUGE plus for this phone? Cortana. She's the virtual assistant that kicks the pants off Siri and Galaxy (or whatever they're calling her now). Voice sounds human, no robotic tone, answers the same stupid questions like ""tell me a joke"" etc, and functions just as well as a personal assistant as the rest. Although to be honest I only ever used any of them to ask stupid questions. The voice for the GPS is better too, although the directions are a little confusing, like it will tell you to make a slight right to get in the right turn lane to make a right turn. While tenchically correct, that's kind of a 'well duh' thing and is a little confusing when you see a slight right arrow, as your next 'action' but need to make a full right turn. App store is also disappointing. Alot of apps that are for iphone and android dont' exist here. Windows phones most definitely do NOT get the app support other devices do, and this makes it especially bad since Google and Microsoft fued with eachother, so alot of Google apps are either cumbersome or nonexistant. Like I had said, this made a great temporary backup phone for me, and if you like the windows interface, you'll probably enjoy this. I'll keep it as a backup, but I'll stick with Android as my primary.",2014年12月29日 在美国审核
"No iphone, still pretty useful","No this one is no match for an iphone or for a 100-200$ priced android phone.And the only reason you're able to buy such a phone at this 30$ish price is because it's a dying platform with very little competition (and thus very limited quality) among apps available. And since you can't make use of the best hardware without accompanying software, this limits the functionality of the phone severely.I've used both Iphone and Android phones in the last few years, and it's impossible not to miss great apps on both platforms.That said, I was able to find free, decent apps for many of my needs: RSS reeder with Feedly support, dictionaries, Spotify, Amazon shopping, Kindle, EPUB readers, Python documentation (and shell), etc. They're a lot more friction-ful and tedious compared to their slick, perfected Android and iOS counterparts, but they're certainly usable.Actually, the gmail support is built into the software, didn't even have to download an app. It's not a great interface, but syncs nicely, and will do for mail checking and very occasional sending.The PROCESSOR &amp; RAM proved enough for running the applications meeting the needs listed above , with several apps open at once. It's certainly fast enough so far.The CAMERA is pretty primitive compared to Iphone 4 and up, or a last gen Samsung android phone, it's right on the border of being too crappy to use and being decent enough.The SOUND is pretty decent with good reception, and good enough for music listening.The UPDATE to 8.1 operating systemruns smoothly and takes less than half an hour altogether.I had an existing GO-PHONE account with a regular (not micro) SIM card. I was able to just put in the provided micro sim card, and call AT&amp;T to get my account info transferred to the new sim. That whole process took around 15-20 mins altogether.Will update this review after some more experience with the phone.",2015年1月25日 在美国审核
This was one of the best buys ever!,"Well, I really do love it. This was an opportunistic buy from Amazon one day when the price was under twenty dollars. With no ambition to have a smartphone, I set about devising uses for it. I put in a memory chip but not the supplied go-phone SIM, connected to my wifi and downloaded some handy free apps. Within a few weeks the Here Drive+ app had justified the cost all by itself. Realizing that an eight week European trip was looming I downloaded maps to France and Germany (Here Drive works brilliantly as a nav. system anywhere) and headed to an AT&amp;T office. There they adopted the new phone into my old post paid plan, with a different phone chip, and graciously gave mean unlock code. Arriving in Paris I bought and substituted a prepaid French SIM card, unlocked the phone and went on my way. On returning home the switch back was seamless. So now I have an excellent phone, a nav system and use of the internet at home or any wifi location. As yet the data connection is still turned off. The phone is a tad small but for twenty bucks I don't mind a bit. I should add that the phone camera takes better pictures more easily than my much heavier digital Kodak. I think Nokia knows a thing or two. They make the navigation app as well.",2015年10月11日 在美国审核

A totally unfair comparison...,"I will preface this with a disclaimer:In May, 2015 we bought new BLU Android phones to replace these and use these as backup... and in fact my wife accidentally dropped her expensive ($250) BLU Selfie phone into a mop bucket and destroyed it, so she is back to using the 520 while we are waiting for her new phone to arrive.It still works like new and no complaints other than it is small and non-prestigious.The Nokia 520s are a little less sensitive (usually one less bar) and of course don't have the 13MP cameras, but for the tiny cost we paid for them, they are truly a bargain.------------------------------------------------------------------This is a preliminary review, just received today, but I have been exposed to my wife's 520 for a month now and already know most of the features and delights.My old phone (which will finally be thrown as far into the woods as I can heave it) was a Samsung Flight II... the worst phone ever made... Probably bought by Samsung from some North Korean sweatshop... a true scam of a phone... read my review if you want a laugh.A lot of what I like about this phone is the Windows O/S... so simple and user friendly... very thoughtful layout and operation.Every I-Phone and Samsung owner my wife has shown her (cheap) Lumia to has said they will buy one of these.I won't go through all of the features, I just want to say they work, they are easy and logical and quick.I'm sure I'll add more to this review as I continue to marvel at it... it's at least 1000 times better than my old Samsung side slider and half the price!Oh... forgot to mention the good service at ATT when I had them set my phone up with the same number I had before. (since the old phone was dumb, not smart, I couldn't just swap sim cards). I had a hard time finding the right number to call, but the tech (name Ty) was so helpful and so kind, taking as much time as I needed to magnify the tiny numbers on the sim card, looking for the mislaid back cover so I could turn it on, etc.Thank you so much ATT....OK a little confusion to me because I was originally told these phones would do wifi even if you've never turned on AT&amp;T data service... that's TRUE, but my router had to be changed before I could do it... something to do with static dns, which I don't understand much about, but my savvy brother helped me get it going.I don't really need internet on my phone though because our home has a desktop, a chromebook and two Tab 3s :)Maybe someday I'll be somewhere that I need internet and there's wifi available, but I can't really foresee that.Favorite feature:(not that I advocate driving and using a cellphone) ... but you don't even have to look at your phone to make a call, just press the windows button at the center bottom, it beeps, then say ""Call (Name)"" and the phone voice responds ""Calling (Name)""... ring ring talk talk, eyes on the road.UPDATE:Still very pleased with this phone and discovering new features every week.Looks great, even with the case.............but where is the $ dollar sign symbol?I can't find it!There IS a British Pound symbol, but not $.Another note... I have now used wifi at several locations, even while sitting in the parking lot at a shopping center, thanks to a nearby bistro.It's a great feature when you need to entertain yourself or use facebook, etc.",2014年2月21日 在美国审核
Windows for everyone!,"Windows phone now with developer 8.1 whats not to love! This phone comes stock with 8.0 and decent hardware (it will not beat an iphone) but again it gives you Windows for any GSM carrier! We added two of these to out phone plan for the kids and if the phone gets broken it is cheaper then a dectuable to purchase a new one. The price should come down a little bit as the next version 630 will be out in the USA with in the next month. Sporting better hardware (not front cam) and a little better resolution on the screen. The pictures this thing takes are on par with 2 gen Andorid phones from 2011 so not horrible but not as good as my Lumia 1520. The OS however with Windows 8.1 developer gives all the same cool features including Cortana (which the kids LOVE) that I have on my 1520. Switching between apps is smooth but does have some lag time again this is 512k ram on a dual core chip. Movie play back is good no issue with the Win app store and emulators load on it well to play video games. Again no skype face chat because of the lack of front cam. Other wise this is a truly wonderful phone.There are a ton of screen protectors and cases out there for them. One lacking feature that they wish they had was Qi or PMA wireless (pinless) charging. If you need a front cam or wireless charging this is not for you. Also the wifi range is pretty good in the house almost as good as my Nexus7 (1st gen) tablet.The Windows 8 OS (stock) is cool, but lacking some key features, that's why we upgraded to 8.1 developer on all phones ( and that fact that I am developing a Win App :-) ). But the live tiles do allow good battery life of over 8 hours with mid usage. The color full titles do get distracting again part of the removal on 8.1 allow transparency. So if you have an extra 50 and need a phone for either a back up or a new phone buy this one, and wait for the over the air update for 8.1 you won't be sorry.Ps Netflixs plays very well and does not green screen or have the same issues as Andorid and Apple have.",2014年7月10日 在美国审核
"Not bad, if you get it cheap","I got a fantastic deal on this thing, at&amp;t was selling them here for $19.99 so I snatched it up.Figured even if it was a dud I couldn't go too wrong at that price.I don't use the phone or sim.I just use it to connect to wifi for FB, library, weather, photos, etc. I had wanted to use it as a radio for when I'm out walking the dog, but so far the only app I've found insists I agree to let at&amp;t charge me mega amounts for the data use, so I passed on that. But that's ok, my REAL (non at&amp;t) phone has a radio with no charge for using it.The missing star is because I find taking photos with it a hassle. I think my photo button is broken, so I have to find the app, which wants to show me pics when I want to take one, and wants to take one when I want to look at pics taken. I have to wrestle it into submission. hard to see what I'm doing when out in the sun...but, somehow I have managed to get a few good shots.Also, and I don't know if this is just a component of all smart phones or just this one, but it's unreliable in it's functions on the web. On FB sometimes I'll have to stab LIKE ten times to get it to take, sometimes it won't re-orient it's self when I turn it for a wider view, and sometimes it won't expand something I'm trying to look at, or will suddenly be too sensitive, taking orders I didn't give, driving me nuts and sending me back to my computer.But all in all, for 19.99 it's nice to have access to the web when not sitting in front of my computer.I'm glad I didn't pay any more than that though.UPDATE:1 1/2 yrs later.at least 25 times a day I'd like to throw this thing at a wall.Like I said above, I got it to use as a portable FB, mostly but other things too.The Windows-created App for FB (you have to download it from the windows store) is a bloody nightmare, Seriously, it crashes, (which means it drops you out of FB and back to your start page maybe every 3 - 5 minutes.I kid you not.Thank god I've still got a desktop computer or I would have killed this thing by now.Evidently Windows went on to make OTHER versions for their newer, pricier phones, and have said f.u. to the lumina 520 users.It never upgrades. i've uninstalled it and reinstalled in hopes of getting a better version.No such luck.it's just a peice of you know what.But all my other apps are fine as wine. I can games for hours, NO PROBLEMO!It's just the windows FB app.Thanks Mr Gates...not.Oh, and one other thing, since we can only get apps from the windows store, wouldn't it be NICE if windows would make a bloomin APP for THAT? Instead of making us navigate their PC website which our phone HATE.I finally started using App of the day, but you can't just go shopping with that, you get what they deliver.if you want to look for an app...such nonsense...",2015年6月1日 在美国审核
best value for an AT&amp;T back up smartphone,"This would have been a great phone circa 2009-2010, as it stands in 2014 there are bits and pieces that make it feel like it belongs both in the past and the present. The Windows OS and exterior design is thoroughly modern and reaps the benefits of smarthphone evolution since 2010 while the hardware internals and screen feel more like Iphone 3GS era.The phone is an amazing value when you factor in the price. Updating to the latest Windows OS is classic windows, update once, then check again for updates, and update again. This is where IOS/Android have the clear advantage; the Lumia update process is mired in the windows process and takes a very long time. The touchscreen is noticeably less sharp and websites take more zooming to turn legible. Once up and running on 8.1, it comes with a lot of features but the windows store experience is incoherent; I have win8 tablet apps that I have to buy again for the phone platform? Plex also runs like crap on this so I wouldn't expect to watch many videos on this.Onto the screen, it's nicely sized but the keyboard is sized very small and I have never been less accurate than on this phone, colors are bright, but viewing angles aren't great. There are moments of touch sluggishness as well, not sure to attribute to the OS or to the hardware itself. The OS font is optimized for the low resolution screen but out on the web, you will notice that you need to zoom in quite a bit more.The hardware is classic budget nokia, the frame feels solid, the back cover is cheap and thin, but overall it looks and feels like a well put together package. You can almost hear the engineer say ""good enough"" but nothing spectacular.Integrating my contacts with gmail was confusing and required signing on a computer to lower my security settings, I know Microsoft wants us to use their contacts but this doesn't exactly make it easy to cross platforms. The web browser is noticeably slow even on wifi, when was the last time you noticed chunks of the screen loading?Overall, this is an insane value for a back up smartphone that is both held up by the modern OS as well as held back by its old internals and screen.I will likely unlock this phone and turn into my go to for travel.",2014年9月24日 在美国审核
How to surprise a Gadget Geek Snob,"I have always been a gadget geek, and prided myself on always being one of the first to have each new gadget that came out.I even turned my Palm Pilot into a phone before ""smartphone"" was even a word.I bought these phones as stocking stuffers for my kids to use for playing games, and kept one for myself. And as a HINT to get off my phone plan and get their own before they bankrupt me. Of course I had to open it and check it out.Since I am already familiar with the new Windows, it was a breeze to use.I must have said 10 times in the first hour ""Are you kidding me?A $20 phone does this, and this, and that""?All these features I thought you needed a $600 phone for.I never even had to look in the instructions, because it was all so simple.The hardest part of setting this phone up was opening the package.Of course every iphone owner will point out to you the ten things their phone does this doesn't, but I don't think I would ever use those features, and I bet they won't use the blood pressure thing more than twice either.My kids didnt take the hint, so I left them with the $300 framily plan, and got my own $35 plan.At&amp;t reception is MUCH better, I always had to use a signal booster before, now I get great coverage.Do a google search for MVNO carriers on the AT&amp;T network, and you will find any plan you want, even as low as $5 a month.These carriers use the AT&amp;T towers, same exact service, for a portion of the price.They can port your number in seconds.If you buy this phone, you can still buy an Ipad or tablet or whatever and have money left over vs buying a new cutting edge phone that will be obsolete soon.Within two years, we will be using Wifi for calling (just like we do with data now), with the mobile network as a backup, and every device will be able to make and receive calls.Im buying a bunch of these, if I break one, just pop out the card and swap it in seconds.I can't believe I used to pay insurance every month for the priveledge of getting a repaired/defective phone for $150 when I broke mine.",2015年2月2日 在美国审核

such a good deal for those who don't ask a lot from a phone...,"I bought this phone after my wife accidentally washed my previous 4.5 years old phone in my pocket. That was not a smartphone and had no fancy features so upgrading to this entry level smartphone was a giant leap for me. Although I have not myself owned a smartphone before, I am familiar with the mobile devices due to my sister's samsung galaxy s4 and my two android tablets (two kindle fire HD's and nexus 7) After a week of use my initial experience is as follows:Pros:1-Unbeatable price. I paid $54 for a smartphone with the screen size as big as an Iphone which is great... I have already been an AT&amp;T go phone user and thus being locked in AT&amp;T did not make a difference for me. If you are a current go-phone customer all you need to do is to go to an AT&amp;T branch and replace your old full size sim card with a micro sim card. The good news is that the card is free. The bad news is that upon getting that card your old one becomes cancelled so you don't have a reserve card and you lose the numbers stored in that card. But it was no big deal for me.2-Screen quality: This is the most receptive screen I have so far seen. It is very easy to type and scroll due to high sensitivity of the screen. The screen has 235 ppi pixel density which may look low compared to high end smartphones like samsung galaxy S4 (441ppi) and iphone 4 (336ppi) but relatively similar to my tablets kindle fire hd 8.9 inch (254ppi) and 7 inch (216ppi) So even watching movies, I saw nothing troubling to the eye.3- Windows 8 operating system: This is both a plus and a minus. It is a plus since it is pretty fast and performs great in most applications as well as browsing the net and watching videos. Especially watching videos might be a big trouble for android devices since flash issupported in neither silk browser (the worst browsing experience ever thanks to amazon) nor chrome (fast and reliable but does not support flash and my only option was to use third party browser like dolphin in those devices. Luckily this phone performs great with those troublesome videos using internet explorer. I had no compability issues and no freezing or crashing websites yet.4-Built in apps: There are some apps coming from AT&amp;T and some from nokia in addition to the built in windows apps. I found some pretty useful. Maps and the GPS function performs well and yet I have not missed google maps.5-Processor and memory functions: Considering this as a $54 phone, it has pretty good features in this field. I know 512mb ram sucks , especially if you are after gaming or challenging apps. But As long as you don't force the memory with demanding apps and lot's of files that would work fine. On the other hand 1ghz Qualcomm dual core processor is unexpectedly good for a device that cheap. The greatest hit in this category is that it has an expandable memory option. The starting 8gb is pretty low but it can handle up to 64gb micro SD card which puts this device over the brand new amazon firephone and nexus 5 where you are stuck with what you buy. That means a lot of videos, photos and other stuff...6-Photo and video quality: This is again both a plus and a minus. I recorded a couple of videos with quite good results and the photos are good if taken under good lighting conditions. 5MP is not bad at all.7- Several other fancy apps I have discovered so far (will update if I find out something new in the future) The ones I liked best are the voice command SMS function, the automatic battery protector function as well as auto activated drive mode.Cons:1- Windows operating system: The apps are pretty limited and I miss the apps I used a lot in my android devices. It may get better in time but not there yet. Besides the start screen does not get to horizontal view so you have to go through it vertically as if the phone was orientation locked.2-Photo has no flash which makes it pretty inadequate under dim light. Camera does not have zoom and has no image stabilizer. It also gets confused when trying to focus in fast movements causing blurred unfocused frames for split seconds.3- The charger does not have a detachable USB cord and it is not very long. That is not a big deal for me since I have plenty of different chargers around but it would be nice to have a detachable original charger.4-No front camera: No way you can enjoy video calls..5-SAR value. This is something most people ignore but that shows howmuch radiation a phone emits and this was my biggest consideration before purchasing my previous phone. This phone ranks moderate for emission 0.77W/kg which is half the maximum allowed limit but more than double of samsung galaxy s4 (0.33W/kg) Those who makes a lot of calls should consider more brain friendly versions. I do not normally use the phone a lot so I could oversee that fact for this model...The cons list can be added a lot of other stuff but I am trying to be fair in my review by considering the price for value factor. Therefore I rate this phone pretty high and way above my expectations. With some cheap accessories like a screen protector and a case, I am sure I will be able to enjoy it for my modest needs for quite a long time.",2014年7月17日 在美国审核
Very good phone - extraordinary value,"If you are looking for a nicely featured smartphone, and don't want to pay a lot of money, this is a great choice.I replaced my 3 1/2 year old Samsung Focus (which was Windows Phone 7), and this is definitely a step up. The Focus was my favorite phone of all time, and this beats it. The 520 is snappy, has a decent screen, a good camera, and is easy to figure out and use.I dropped in a 32GB microSD, and it's got room for all my music (about 18GB worth), plus a large set of pictures and documents. A mobile version of Office means I can work with stuff produced by my desktop - admittedly at a minimal level. One nice app Office related app (available from the store for free) is a remote for Powerpoint, which ties to the desktop running your slides via Bluetooth.Bluetooth pairing with car audio worked first time out, where my son's iPhone 5 did not. There are also plenty of music apps available - Pandora and Spotify, for instance. The basic media player built in is adequate, and all I had to do for my music to work on the phone was drag my desktop's music folder over to the phone.The built in browser (IE) is adequate, and web page rendering is way faster than my Focus. Typing for texts and notes is about the same as any other smartphone, which means a lot of mistakes, but autocorrect smooths over most of them.I don't watch much video on my phone, and I don't use it for a reader, so I don't need or want the larger size of some of the other phones. This one is light and fits fine in my jeans pocket.Battery life so far is pretty good - several days even with WiFi and Bluetooth activated.And all this was (at the time I got it), just over fifty bucks. I'm not using this as a GoPhone - I have a regular wireless account and the ATT rep put in a new micro SIM card for nothing. My phone book and calendar synced from my Microsoft email account, and I was set to go.Only drawback I've seen so far: if you drop it, that back is almost certainly going to pop off and the battery will come out. I know there are other smartphones that do this, but it still gets on my nerves, and I don't really understand why they can't engineer something better. I got one of those rubberized cases to stop that, but it bulks up the phone so much I took it off.**** Update 2 August 2014 ****In case you are wondering about Windows Phone 8.1 on this phone, yesterday my phone prompted me for two upgrades. The first prepared the phone for Windows Phone 8.1, and the second update installed 8.1.The updated OS is smoother, and has the Cortana assistant. The voice recognition on Cortana is quite good, but a lot of it is really just reskinned Bing search. The voice prompts for appointments and such are nice, and Cortana knocks out one more iPhone advantage by being comparable to Siri.Otherwise not much different, but I'm relieved that I have the latest version of the OS even on a phone this inexpensive.",2014年7月19日 在美国审核
Great price for a mediocre phone,"Be aware of what you're getting into with Windows Phone - do your research ahead of time, and make sure any killer, must-have apps that you rely on are actually available on the Windows Phone store (hint: they're probably not).As of when I received it on 8/5/14, this phone has the Windows Phone 8.1 update available for it, making it one of the first Windows Phone 8.1 devices available.Getting to 8.1 from out of the box took about 1.5 hours worth of updates - first about an hour of catch-up type updates, and then about 30 minutes for the 8.1 update to download and install.Overall, I'm OK with the phone.I purchased this for a development test device, not to use day-to-day, so my expectations weren't high.I think one of the things Microsoft nailed with Windows Phone is the Live Tiles - they absolutely work on a phone interface, and provide a sort of beautiful consistency that's hard to achieve with Android's widgets, or Apple's, well, app icons.I do wish there was a bit more power in our ability to create a decent home screen layout - like an option for multiple pages, or even just spacers between groups of apps, like in Windows 8/8.1 desktop.I'm also incredibly pleased that there's minimal locked-on bloatware - and all of it is from Microsoft, trying to provide some sort of out-of-the-box fully functional device.I was able to effortlessly remove all the AT&amp;T and Nokia junk that I don't want, without having to root/jailbreak the phone, or flash a custom ROM.I'm quite content with my current phones, an iPhone 5s and a Galaxy S4, however this low budget phone undoubtedly differentiates itself from those.When it's time to upgrade one of my phones, I'll honestly probably give Windows Phones a closer look than I might have in the past.One other thing I'll mention is that the phone I got has likely been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.There are two stickers on the phone when you first open it up:one on the screen, and one that runs the length of the interior shell, and protrudes from the top as sort ofa pull-tab type thing to help you get the back shell off to insert the battery and SIM card.The front sticker left an annoying residue on the screen that make it difficult to use until I cleaned it off.The sticker inside the shell had become so strongly affixed, that it tore off a decent chunk of the foam pad meant to keep the battery in place.",2014年8月6日 在美国审核

"Love, Love, Love","UPDATE:I've had this phone now for right at two years and am still very pleased with it.The camera is as good as any regular digital camera and having it set on automatic uploads to my computer means no worries about accidentally deleting any.I've dropped this phone a few times and it's been okay.Overall, two years later and I still love it.The only negative is the lack of Windows phone apps even now.I ordered this for my daughter and somehow I screwed up and ordered 2.I initiated a return on the second one but then she got hers for Christmas and opened it immediately to get it set up and this completely changed my mind.I have been using an old crappy phone for years, didn't even have a camera, and was frankly intimidated by the new ones.My kid has been using an android for years and kept saying I needed to just try one.I got one from another company and she said it was not a good one and sure enough I couldn't get the hang of it...the touch screen was sensitive and the keyboard was difficult and I just gave up.This one is so easy to use and I am loving having all the conveniences.I'm such a dinosaur that I didn't realize it would load my email until it just popped up after just touching a few tabs and entering my passwords...my kid is so happy I am joining the modern world at last.She is very picky and she loves this phone and so do I.I am amazed and how good the camera is on this phone. The only thing my daughter would change is that it doesn't have a front facing camera but that is not a big deal if you don't care aboutselfies...and I don't!I am really happy with this phone and very glad for my screw-up that led to me owning my own.It's really great to keep a kid's 'spending' under control as well since she can't go over minutes unless I pay for more.Since we both text more than anything and we live in an area that is saturated with hotspots and we have wi-fi at home so we don't need the data package, the unlimited texts plan, the cheapest one is fine for us.Love this phone!And another cool thing is that you can get all kinds of cases for next to nothing for this one...521 cases work for it too!",2015年2月3日 在美国审核
Should You Buy the Nokia Lumia 520?,"The Nokia Lumia 520 is a phone that’s all about compromises. You don’t get to make a phone that sells for as little as $49 without cutting a few corners. But Nokia has generally made the right cuts in the right places. The front-facing camera, NFC, a compass and a camera flash are all things that many people simply won’t miss much – especially when the rear camera isn’t too bad to use in daylight.The issue that’s harder to shrug off is the top screen layer, which is highly reflective and makes outdoors use tricky. As the Lumia 620 has a polarization filter to reduce reflections – and a cuter design – we’d recommend opting for that more expensive model if the difference in price isn’t too great. However, like the Lumia 520, the Nokia Lumia 520 once again proves a seriously attractive alternative to a budget Android.VerdictThe Nokia Lumia 520 cuts all the fat off Nokia’s more expensive Windows Phone 8 Lumia phones to bring the slick Windows experience to budget buyers. There are missing features, but most aren’t missed. This is a fab budget phone.",2015年6月1日 在美国审核
Pleasently Surprised,"For a $50 phone, this thing isn't so bad. As a previous iPhone (3G and 4) and Android (Galaxy S3) user, I figured I'd give WP a shot. Bought it, threw in my AT&amp;T sim and was good to go. I bought this because I broke too many phones this year to warrant spending any more real cash on a new phone.My 5 star rating is mostly about the Windows Phone operating system more than it is about the actual device. The device itself is OK, though it lacks some featuresI prefer to have. My biggest gripes are there's no front facing camera and there's no flash in the rear camera. That aside, the phone is light, feels solid, and has a bright, clear screen. The device to price ratio is exceptional though.I must say, I'm impressed. The OS runs very smooth and the live tiles are fun to configure to your taste. It's easy to nagivate and to configure the settings. Apps launch quickly. The battery life is decent on this phone - better than the S3, and maybe slightly less that the iPhone. Having a bunch of Live Tiles can also drain your battery, though I found on the Android platform, I always had to switch off bluetooth/nav/etc. in order to preserve battery life. That's not the case with this. Unfortunately, there really is a lack of Apps for WP when you compare to iOS or Android. However, your basic apps are all here - facebook, twitter, instagram, pandora, what's app, (a good 3rd party) snapchat client, etc. There's plenty to keep me entertained, and this is really the only drawback of WP I can find. I'm running WP8.0 at the tiem of this writing and am looking forward to 8.1's release.Overall, at $50-60, this is a great introduction to WP or if you're looking for a cheap replacement phone until your contract is up. Would I buy this again? YES. When my contract is up for renewal, am I going to buy a brand new shiny Windows Phone? Quite possibly - this thing is growing on me. I just want to see more app support.TL;DR: Sweet phone.",2014年4月25日 在美国审核
Amazing price-for-quality 8/10,"For the price of this phone the capabilities are amazing. At this point I'm not sure why anyone would bother spending the outrageous amount of money that Ipods cost. You can get this phone and a Micro SD card for under $100 almost year-round. If you buy it on sale you can get a 64GB Micro SD with this phone for around $50. That is around $200 less than an Ipod Touch, it also allows you to use Cortana, a new search function/Program for the windows phone. If you want to use it as an MP3 player or a phone I would recommend it. In fact if you want to use this thing as a decoration, I'd still recommend it. For the price I can't see a single reason anyone wouldn't buy this phone.Pros/Cons-Awesome Speaker W/ great sound quality 9/10-Decent Camera 6/10-Good load time and processing speed 6.5/10-Cortana (This is as good as hardware) 8/10-Microphone Quality 7/10-Price 10/10-Looks/Weight 10/10-Difficulty to use (10 being very easy) 8/10-Screen quality 8/10-Durability (Anything with a touch screen is easier to damage than without) 8/10-Apps (Less than android and Iphone) 5/10-Comes with a charger and a Micro USB to USB cable 10/10One more thing, to update the phone you'll need to put the SIM card in, which can be done by removing the battery on the back. You will also have to do this in order to use certain functions on the phone, you do NOT however need to purchase a phone package.This phone also uses AT&amp;T which I'd rate 6/10, I find most phone companies to be lacking in general. However, for what it is, the service is not bad and the plans are fairly decent as well. I would use this just as a multitask capable device rather than a phone any day, which isn't to say it's not also a good phone.

The best inexpensive smartphone on market today,"The Lumia 520 is an excellent low-cost smartphone. It runs the easy-to-use and rock-solid Windows Phone 8 system, and unlike Android, WP does not track and keep tab on everything you do on your phone and then secretely spy on you.The 4-inch screen is IPS and it has great viewing angles and fast response time.Color reproduction is quite good if not 100% accurate yet (you get that on the Lumia 1520's new IPS screen).The touch screen is very responsive and accurate.AT&amp;T's GoPhone plans really suck and are not really good values, especially when compared with T-Mobile (our family also has a Lumia 521 for T-Mobile), but its network is lightyears ahead of T-Mobile's, so the trade-off is acceptable to me as I give this to my son and being able to make and receive calls is more important than anything else for a youngster like him.Speaking of a phone for kids, Windows Phone's Kids' Corner feature is truly excellent.It sandboxes apps and games you select for kids, and also disables to capacitive Search button at the bottom.A tip if you use Kids' Corner but want to let your kids browse the web: you can't add Internet Explorer to Kids' Corner, but you can download the free yet excellent UC Browser and add it to Kids' Corner.Be sure to use Bing as your search engine as it does not invade your privacy as much as Google does, and you can turn off tracking entirely, again unlike with Google's services.Bing also returns better search results than Google, and is extremely friendly for kids (save for the ""Trending today"" links on its homepage, but you can semi-hide them).This phone is super-light. The back cover is plastic and can be removed, which means two things: 1) you can replace the battery if you want, and 2) you can get a different-color cover if you want.Be sure to get a replacement cover and/or a case specifically marked for the 520, as its cousin the 521 is slightly longer.The 520 feels much lighter than the 521 for some reason, even though spec-wise it's not really that much lighter. Both are light, perfect for kids and any pocket.One more thing: to cut cost both this 520 and T-Mobile's 521 include only 512MB of RAM (plus 8GB of storage supplemented by MicroSD support).Not all WP apps run on 512MB phones, although the vast majority do.It's mostly a few games that required 1GB.All the popular non-game apps and most games do run on 512MB phones.In summary, this is an excellent low-cost phone that actually beats most mid-range Android phones in quality and feature set.It's also robust, and does not spy on you like Android.The only question is, do you like AT&amp;T?",2013年12月30日 在美国审核
Great Phone -  Piratical ATT carrier,"Nokia, sorry for the 2 stars, the phone is great, but you have to use it with a carrier and AT&amp;T ispracticing extortion (probably technically just price gouging).I bought this phone a year ago because I wanted a smart phone WITHOUT a data plan. And that is what I have and love.So I bought one for my elderly mother last week and when we went to get it set up, found that AT&amp;T now requires a data plan for all smart phones.Now there is a switch on this phone that turns off data over the cell network.So I have never used any AT&amp;T data.And my mother would never use any data either.Update:Gave two more stars because I was able to get my plan.A very nice person responded to this review and showed me how to make it work.I took an old flip phone in and another helpful clerk at the ATT store got me up and going with a 10 cents a minute plan and I've turned off the cellular data and it looks like we are good.The plan I have costs $107 a year for 400 minutes that roll over.I just rolled over $61.I use many features on the smart phone but Mother would only use voice.She has severe arthritis and has a real problem both with pushing buttons on the basic phones and seeing the small text and buttons.It would be very useful to her to just push people and then push the person she wants to call.But the minimum data plan is $25 per month so we are talking a huge difference in cost.And all for service that she will not use!She only needs an emergency phone.AT&amp;T is not the only carrier requiring this, but it is outrageous that they are using their position as semi-monopolies to force payment for unwanted services.The fact that this phone COULD, and by most people WOULD use cellular data is insufficient reason for requiring everybody to pay for it.It is a PREPAID service.They could charge an exorbitant rate for data.It's not like you wouldn't notice, as there is a message that you MUST reply to after EVERY call that tells you your balance.We are in an area with limited alternatives for cellular service and AT&amp;T has the fewest dead spots in our area.They are in the position of being able to dictate how you use your equipment and that is what they are doing.If you need to use cellular data, thisis a great phone.I will be contacting AT&amp;T and the FCC but with zero hope.I will also have to look again at some elder phones that we had rejected as not so useful to my Mother.Unfortunately, I cannot return her phone as she tore open the box to get to it.",2014年9月21日 在美国审核
There are probably better choices but you might have to pay more,"The phone works ok, but I notice the antenna must not be as good as my previous phone.I almost always had four bars on my old phone here at my house.With this phone it is one or two bars and once I even lost connection.Also the Wi-Fi icon shows that connection is weaker than on my previous phone.The battery charge on my old phone lasted five to seven days (I don't use the phone much).On this phone, the battery charge phone lasts only two days and I'm not using it any more than I did the old phone.I thought that since it was a Microsoft phone I could sync directly with Outlook on my PC, but I can't.With my old phone there was an app on my PC and on the phone and all I had to do was plug the phone into the PC to sync contacts, calendar, and tasks.I haven't found that app for the new phone.I have had to set up an Outlook.com email account and copy my contacts to that account.I didn't need another email account.I still haven't figured out how to get my calendar into Outlook.com with the event descriptions.I followed the import directions I found on the internet and the events must have transferred, because it showed ""busy"" times, but none of the descriptions were there.It doesn't do any good to show I have an appointment on Wednesday, but not tell me what it is.The texting keyboard is slightly off so I have to be sure to hit the space left of a letter, otherwise I get the letter that is on the keyboard to the right of the one I want.The text prediction is nice - when I start a word, the app predicts what I'm going to type and I can select the word for a list rather than typing the whole word.If I type ""tha"", ""thank"" is one of the words at the top of the screen that I can select and then ""you"" is displayed on the next selection list. The texting keyboard didn't have a comma, but after I had to do a phone reset for another reason, the comma was there.????The camera is much better than the one on my old phone, but there is no forward camera to take selfies.I uploaded the pictures of my grandkids and wanted them to display in file name order.I named the .jpg documents so they would display in family order.The only option I seem to have is for them to display in the order the pictures were taken (which I understand makes sense for pictures you take with the phone).I just wish there was an option to display in other orders.I haven't loaded any apps into the phone.The one app I wanted is available for android and i-phone only.",2014年9月14日 在美国审核
"It doesn't have every feature under the sun, but what it does, it does perfectly","When considering the Lumia 520, you have to take into consideration its price.Some reviews will knock it for not having a front-facing camera, or for its comparatively low-resolution screen, but those comparisons are really unfair.If you go to a Ford dealership to buy a car, you don't expect to be driving away in a Ferrari, so anyone looking at phones in this price range needs to be honest in their expectations.What Nokia has done is to create a phone that works spectacularly and prices it as a budget model.And they've done that very, very well.This little phone does everything that most $200+ (off-contract pricing) phones can do and does most of those things at least as well if not better.A typical Android phone priced at less than $150 tends to have some major compromises, the primary one being performance.Apple doesn't offer anything in that range.The Lumia 520, on the other hand, (unless you count high-end games) doesn't compromise performance, and leaves out very few features.The phone even makes a great alternative to something like an iPod Touch (which start, BTW, around $200).It makes a nice music player, especially if you add a microSD card for extra storage.It makes a great GPS -- you can download maps ahead of time so you don't even need to have signal coverage for it to do door-to-door driving directions, and it uses Navteq maps, which are even better than Google's.There are tens of thousands of really good games.It holds onto weak cellular signals better than most phones out there.And with Windows Phone 8.1, it makes a great personal assistant too.Here's the best part -- you don't really even have to sign up for an AT&amp;T account to use these features.(An AT&amp;T SIM is required to get past the initial activation, but surely one of your friends has a SIM they'd let you borrow for a few minutes.)Once the phone has been through its initial configuration it doesn't need cellular coverage any longer.It continues to function great on WiFi only for everything except phone calls and texting (and even those issues can be overcome with something like Skype).AT&amp;T probably wouldn't like me telling you this, but it is true.This really is a fantastic little phone.Just don't expect to be getting all of the features of something else that would cost you $400 or more off-contract.For what it costs it is an absolute bargain.",2014年6月1日 在美国审核
A steal,"Could be perfect phone depending on your needs. I use this as a personal media device, GPS recorder, backup camera, and GPS navigator. I haven't used the phone features yet so I will not be reviewing those.Hardware:For being the lowest-end Lumia model, the user experience is surprisingly fluid. My 3yo Android Captivate kept frustrating me by struggling to respond to my input, but the 520 responds almost instantly and there's no lag in the animations - it's a pleasure to use.Not a single issue with the GPS, it's worked every single time so far (I've been using it to record my bike commutes and hikes). Love that I can hold the camera button and go into the camera without fumbling with the screen - even if I have gloves on, that's a big win right there. The image quality is so-so, you won't be printing any of these, but I didn't expect anything great. However, the best camera is the one you have with you, and this one does work for capturing a moment and sharing it with friends/family.Software:Huge, huge nod to Nokia Maps. The device is worth the money just for this functionality alone. Free offline maps? Hell yes! OK, the maps may not be as detailed as Google's or OpenStreetMap's, but they do have POIs and they still work - and the Drive app works BETTER than a standalone Garmin unit I have (rant: why can't Garmin, in this day and age, fix their damn POI search algorithm - it never works!). The directions the Drive app gives are excellent, I have even been using it without looking at the screen, and it always gives timely, clear directions.Nokia Transit is also great for finding bus and train routes, and Nokia Radio is a nice little bonus, though the sound quality could be better. The default music player app is a little lacking in usability, so it takes away from using this device as a music player (but I haven't tried any 3rd-party apps yet). Sound quality is just fine.The email app is easy to use and the keyboard is not intrusive as it can sometimes be on Android. In fact, I prefer checking my email on my Windows device now, it feels a bit more business-oriented.I won't be reviewing the Windows Phone OS in great detail (yeah, not as many apps), but I'll just mention that having experience with Android and iOS, I like the live tiles better than having icons all over the screen - though I probably would want to group the tiles by folders.Overall, this phone is great as an entry-level Windows device, and definitely got me interested in a more serious Lumia with a better camera. I haven't tried and don't think I would want to be gaming on this particular model, but I don't see why you can't play basic games.",2014年1月21日 在美国审核
Great value,"This has got to be the best ""bang for your buck"" phone on the market. When my Moto X died on me (my own fault, I was less than gentle), I was worried I wouldn't be able to find another smartphone off-contract without shelling out at least $100 for a sub-par phone running a 4-year old OS. Then I saw this baby. Now, I've never owned a Windows phone before, but I knew I didn't care for Windows 8 very much on my laptop. But I decided that, given the low cost of this phone, I could try it out. After all, I just needed something that would talk, text, and let me use the internet every so often. Windows Phone 8 is a MUCH better implementation of their whole ""metro"" interface and all that. And with an immediate OTA update to WP8.1 waiting for me, it's now fully up to date. I can use the phone for everything I needed, plus I have access to plenty of games and apps to keep me entertained. Do I like it as much as my Moto X? Well, no. Is it good enough? It's much better; it's more than I expected from such a low-priced phone.Pros:It's a cheap smartphone.Very responsiveSmall (I don't like these massive 6"" screens)Expandable storage (microSD)Cons:No front cameraIt feels VERY rectangular. Not as comfortable a phone as I'm used to.Youtube doesn't work right; if I get a ""Decode error"" then I have to restart the phone to play a video.Overall, yes, it has a few faults. But these faults were easily countered by the value I got out of this phone. I bought it as just a backup while I found a better one, but I since decided to just keep it as my primary phone.",2015年2月3日 在美国审核
Windows phone....,"Great screen, yes it is plastic but the phone is cheap and you should be using a case and screen protector anyway.The screen is wide and shows video well. There are no indicator lights on the front and no indicator when charging, which I actually prefer as this is a wifi only device primarily for poke at games and netflix.... both of which it works well for. There are also no front facing cameras nor flash for the back camera.The speaker is good enough to use on its own in a quiet room but it would easily be drowned out with any real activity going on.The main flaws I've found so far are with my experiences using a windows OS phone. It is a better OS style for a phone than it is for a PC... but even with this device I would not be able to stand using the horribleness of Windows 8 to make use of the syncable features. They should have just kept the OS designed for the system it is to be used on. For now the Windows phone OS has some nice apps but it is very limited. At least that means you wont have a dozen knock off versions of every good app out there, unfortunately it means you have access to only a handful of apps worth knocking off in the first place.The curved shape of the phone makes it easier to hold in your hand for extended periods of time, however the buttons that also are mounted on the side and spaced so that they take up the majority of that side makes it so that they will get hit when unwanted. The fact that the power button is right in the middle followed by a dedicated camera button gets kind of irritating when trying to poke at an app. The soft keys are also easily fat palmed into activating which will drop you out of your app and into the Bing search screen or home navigation panel. A case does help with the buttons issue but not the fat palming of the soft keys.Overall this is a great price for a poke at device and works great with wifi with no sim installed. I would not however want to use this on a regular basis as my phone and have not attempted using it on a wifi phone app so I have no idea on the sound quality of the mic.",2014年6月29日 在美国审核
Excellent Value!,"Originally I set out to buy one of the high end Android phones.I even ordered one but then had Amazon recall the order before it was delivered.The problem was I just couldn't bring myself to sign another two year contract for something I wasn't certain I would not regret purchasing for the length of the contract.Nothing out there in late 2013 and early 2014 fit the bill - for me.I looked at this little Lumia 520 and after reading a number of reviews decided to spend $60 and test drive it. The upside of owning the phone outright and it's reputed performance far outweighed having a device with a larger screen and higher specs. So far, I am quite impressed.I really need a phone for email, calendar, some music, a few key apps, maps, and making calls.I am not one to stare at my phone or obsessively check it every idle moment.This little Lumia delivers on all accounts with a very intuitive and eye friendly user interface.I love the live tiles and the ability to put everything right where I want it to be.The settings give me enough control and once you get the hang of the OS it really is very intuitive.Some other pros:Very decent battery life.Nice form factor. Fluid and responsive OS that behaves predictably and isn't constantly pestering me to download an update for everything.It was $60 and NO CONTRACT!I already have a plan with AT&amp;T so I just took it in to a store and they gladly put in a micro SIM for me. Phone calls are well balanced and clear.The user interface for making calls is refined and uncluttered.The added value of the included Nokia apps is also a significant plus, i.e., the ability to use maps offline with a great GPS.The ability to easily delete AT&amp;T bloatware - without rooting!The latest and greatest updates from both Microsoft and Nokia!And, finally, I love the baked in integration of MS Office.Some cons:I really wish Microsoft would move away from requiring that all the buttons be located along the right side of the device.At least move the power button to the top.The camera, as has been mentioned in other reviews, is adequate.The screen is somewhat reflective. It is not Gorilla Glass, but it is very bright and clear and you can adjust the tone and white balance of the screen.Honestly, if Windows phone literally had just a few key apps (not big name ones - niche apps that I use frequently) I would have zero hesitation about going all in for a Windows phone - probably a Lumia 1520. In fact, I may go for it anyway and try to come up with an acceptable workaround. It's a great OS for people who want to use their phone and not constantly fuss and tinker with it.I need my phone to get things done, I don't want it to be an all consuming distraction.I guess that's the difference I notice with Windows phone over Android (my last phone), I am more productive due to not always needing to tweak it.I like that, its a better fit for me.Having a lot of experience with iOS, Android and Windows, I am most impressed with iOS for their quality of apps, but I am most impressed with Windows Phone for it's user interface and productivityIt's obviously not a top tier handset, but it is very good and an unparalleled value.",2014年2月1日 在美国审核
Best bargain in electronics,"Works great on Airvoice (ATT) for $10/month. For dirt cheap, try H2O for $10/three months. Just set APNs (under the cellular and messaging settings). Data use is minimal despite no rooting or firewall, just keep data off until you want to use it. Strong radios, handy size, SD card slot, replaceable battery, FM radio. Apps store is surprisingly good. Favorite apps: myTube (plays in background, saves vids), HERE Drive (turn-by-turn with free state maps), Connectivity Tiles by Mara, MoliPlayer, Nokia Camera Beta, Nokia Xpress and UC browsers with compression, TuneIn Radio, gMaps (w street view), Chase app, Amazon app, PC Remote, Weather Channel (official). I tried Asphalt 8 Airborne, which is kind of fun. You'll probably have to delete some unused apps to make room for it tho. SD card is used only for music, pics and videos. Tip: delete the sample images.My two main gripes are there is no compass for hiking and there is no setting to have the screen stay awake when plugged it. For the latter, I use Alarm Clock by Inhuman which puts a clock on the screen and keeps the phone wake. This also helps mitigate the fact that there are no clock tile apps since tiles are only allowed to update every 30 mins. You can side-load the HTC one with a hack, tho. I actually like having no lights on the buttons (annoying in bed) and rarely use camera flash but do miss having a flashlight. You can get apps which will use the screen as a light but you have to set brightness to max to make them very usable. There is no equalizer for music but it sounds very good as it is. Get some good earbuds like Creative EP630 when they are on sale for $15.Folders are now available as a Nokia app. Many features will be added with WP 8.1.

Best phone I've ever had for the price.,"It seems to be smooth action like asmartphone that I can tell, although, it is my first one and I don't mind that it's a windows phone either.Downloaded a bowling game and that worked well.YT HD movie trailer videos looked great, although, I wouldn't want to watch a whole movie on it. Battery life seems okay so far, even with the wifi on. Using the wifi, you apparently need to search and connect by tapping on it, such as open public. But might work without searching at an AT&amp;T area such as McD. I believe it might also store these in the memory. I've seen these around $59.00 on line and seriously thinking about buying another one for back up at that price. I bought a solid black rubber style back cover at an AT&amp;T store for $15.00. Glad I didn't buy the two toned 'gummy' generic one. I would recommend also buying a $100.00 ONE YEAR SERVICE card if you want it as an AT&amp;T gophone. Wmart might have these (somewhere) I only use BASIC service, but that option might NOT be available other than grandfathered or through an AT&amp;T store. (I've read something like 6 months prior svc)I do feel I was mislead about buying games without a data plan. Here on Amazon for the Xbox online game code. My current rollover is $109.00 I buy 90 day $25.00 cards. (Check the back of the card for 90 days) Having to buy one and refill BEFORE the end date is annoying and I always lose days every time, especially, if it's a week or so early.That's why it's best to buy a years service or even REFILL at an AT&amp;T store. WMart has the MICRO SIM for Straight Talk ON LINE for around $7.00 now. But you might buy them here on Amazon. Make sure it's the MICRO sim. Idk how long the AT&amp;T &amp; ST service partnership will last. But you shouldn't need to unlock the phone if it's an AT&amp;T phone.

"Great phone. Cheap price. Excellent ""starter"" Smart Phone!","I've had my phone now for about 5 days and I love it. It is my first smart phone and so it is somewhat overwhelming to have so much literally at your fingertips. It was easy to set up and I am sure I'm not using nearly half of what I could, but hey, we're just starting out here! I had a different ""Go Phone"" and it used a larger SIM chip. When the package arrived from Amazon, I followed the instructions of not activating the chip and just took it to the local AT&amp;T store, where I found that not only would the transfer everything over for free, I'd made an incredibly good buy on Amazon when it offered a sale at $19.99! The AT&amp;T store is selling this phone currently for $59.99. I also had a $2.00 a day plan with my old Go Phone that actually still works with this phone (rendering some features useless when Wi-Fi is not available, but for now, this is fine.) The data plans are cheap enough, though that I'll be transitioning to one of them soon. The only thing I wish it had (at this point, anyway) was a flash for the camera. The camera is great, takes beautiful pictures, and uses ambient light well, but I still think a flash would be helpful... oh and there's no front-facing camera, but since I don't care to take a selfie, I don't need it.

DONT DO IT!,"I recently purchased the Nokia Lumia 520 Gophone from Amazon brand new in December 2013 and I think you should know some problems I am experiencing with the phone. I experience problems with accessing the web, starting apps, and sending media in text messages DAILY. I constantly have to restart my phone to get things to work properly.For one, apps refuse to start unless they are updated. And when I say apps I mean apps that both come pre-installed on the phone (even At&amp;T's apps like ""HEREdrive"") and ones you can download from the internet onto the phone. This issue is extremely irritating because some apps release updates every week or so. A Nokia representative told me that they can't guarantee apps to work properly on their phone. So basically, they cant even guarantee their own carrier (aT&amp;T) apps to function properly. Several times now, I've been on the road and in need of some GPS guidance from my phone and before anything else I need to stop and update the GPS navigation app. A side note regarding the default application for navigation-- it sucks. I was trying to find an on-ramp to get onto Interstate 5 South in downtown Seattle recently and the navigation gave me directions to 5 North when my destination was clearly set as Portland, OR. If you miss one of your turns while the program is navigating the program will literally freak out and start telling you to turn in the middle of a street or make u-turns on a one way street and it takes a good 5 minutes for the program to recalculate a route.. The navigation program in the andriod is much better I'll have to see if theres an app I can download to change the default program in the Windows phone.Another issue I have is with 4G not working. A customer service representative at Nokia informed me that ""4G/LTE is not supported by your device""....wait what?! That thing in the left-hand corner of my phone that says ""4G"" is that an hallucination? Sometimes I'll go to play Pandora, for example,and it will open but can't ""connect to the network"" when it clearly says I have 4G.Yet, for whatever reason, after restarting the phone it works fine. This particular issue happens pretty often. So much in fact, that it would be more rare if an app actually started working the very first time I opened it then not.Something similar happens when trying to send a text-- it says I have 2 or 3 bars yet it cannot send the message, or cannot send/retrieve media content. I have to flick the ""flight mode"" switch on and off to force a reconnection to the network, and I find myself doing this a lot.I also just discovered that sometimes the camera decides that when you take pictures its going to take 2 at the same time. Go to delete one and it's ""copy"" gets deleted as well. So you just have to be stuck with ""doubles"" of some pictures. This only happens sometimes and I cant seem to recreate the problem in a controlled manner.My advice: look for a different phone!December 2014 update:Decided to try adding music onto my phone. This was, for the most part, a huge disappointment! Mp3s I purchased directly from Amazon will not play on the phone. Meanwhile some pirated content will. Oh when transferring songs onto the phone everything gets copied TWICE (just like the photo problem!) so have to go into the phone and delete all duplicates. Best of all, digital albums I purchased from amazon will only play HALF OF THE SONGS on my phone, saying it can't open the other tracks. WOW just WOW. No wonder people spend $500 on an iphone!

"It Gets The Job Done, With A Few Extras","I find the Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone to be quite nice and was (almost) exactly what I was looking for.It is also a nice size, not too big and not too small.By the fact that I have a GoPhone, you can probably guess just how into mobiles I am.For me, they are what they are and I don't need much else.I mostly use it for quick calls and emergency purposes only.Once in a while I text, browse the net, or take a picture.So far (I have had it for about 2 1/2 months at this point) I have not had any trouble with calls or texting.I only have two complaints.The first one is, sometimes the Wi-Fi (I donot use a data plan) does not pick up well and makes the internet run quite slow (even when I am quite close to the router).The second is the camera.The pictures are not bad, at least from what I see on the screen (I haven't tried printing them) but they aren't going to win any awards.I find at times the camera is very sensitive to camera shake.But, after all, it is a phone and the camera is really a secondary feature.I would have no problem recommending this phone (so far) to anyone who is just looking for a phone with maybe a few extras but nothing fancy.",2015年1月8日 在美国审核
"Good Phone, Bad Service","As someone who didn't really have a ""smartphone"" until now, I found this phone to be easy enough to use.For the most part it's pretty easy to navigate the little tiles to find apps like Twitter, Facebook, or Pandora.As with any smartphone Internet browsing can be hairy depending on the site involved.They recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 which adds new feature like Siri-clone Cortana, which I have yet to use to ask if it's raining outside or how to heat up tomato soup.The Bluetooth is pretty nice for when I want to listen to music through one of my wireless speaker devices or something.Since it's a Windows Phone you might not be able to get all the apps available for Apple and Android phones just yet.The problem with this phone is that it's through AT&amp;T and their service is pretty bad.There are days when I can't access my apps or the Internet without WiFi.They also have this weird policy where it can't renew if your balance is too low.Not your credit card balance, but apparently if you've used your phone too much.Why should that matter unless I've used the whole balance?And really expect to spend more than the price of the phone PER MONTH for AT&amp;T's dreadful service.But if you can get it through another provider it's a great smartphone for the price.",2014年8月5日 在美国审核
Great smart phone for the price,"This is a great smart phone for the price. I've used the Nokia Lumia 635, but like this one better because of how slim it is and the battery seems to last a long time on the 4G Network. I've been using this phone for a while now and I have had no problems with it. I was able to put all of my iTunes music on my phone with a Windows Transfer Application from my computer. I was an iPhone user since 2009 and decided to give Windows Phone a try and I'm glad I did because I love the new Windows Phone 8.1 with Cortana and the live tiles. The phone has pretty decent color/screen size and is equivalent in speed and performance as an iPhone 4S. Although there is only 512 MB of RAM it doesn't seem to hinder it's performance too much. I think that this a good smart phone for the price. It's only $30 so you can't really go wrong. Oh and you can expand the memory by 64 GB giving a total amount of around 72 GB of storage which is nice. Another feature that I like is the proximity sensor which means you can double tap the screen and the phone will turn on. I was skeptical at first, but I was pleasantly surprised of how well it works with my day to day tasks. I use this phone for music, videos, text messaging, surfing the internet, e-mail and some gaming and it works fine. This is no way a phone meant for large platform games, but I think it holds it's own with iPhone 4S. I hope that this review was helpful in making your decision easier.

Really LIke It So Far,"Bought this phone on a Deal of the Day for $39.99.I think it is a great value.I've had an iPhone and an Android.This is my first Windows phone.It seems to be pretty slick feature-wise though I am an atypical cell phone user--I only make a few calls and rely on my home wireless for internet access. I'm not an app freak so I'm satisfied--so far--with what is offered with the phone.It seems to have a nice variety of photo options although published reviews tell me I won't become the next Ansel Adams with this phone. I was able to take the Micro SD Card from my deceased Android phone and put it into this Windows phone without losing any photos. I didn't need any software to accomplish this.The photos are even organized now by month &amp; year.I like the way the photo button slowly rotates through my actual stored photos on the main screen in between the several buttons.AT&amp;T activated the phone for no additional cost and doesn't require a data plan since it is a GoPhone.I bought a$2/day unlimited talk &amp; text plan with a $25 initial refill that is good for 90 days.By my count that is a minimum charge of $8.35 per month for talk &amp; text (although that only equals 12 days of talk &amp; text over 3 months.)(I asked for a phone number that hadn't been used for a long time to cut down on ""wrong numbers"" to the former owner of the number.Incoming calls or text activate the $2 charge for that day. The AT&amp;T rep complied with my request.)For someone who uses the phone infrequently, my plan is a pretty good deal--certainly better than $40/$60 per month for talk&amp; text plus $20 or more per month for a data plan.",2013年12月31日 在美国审核
Great as an MP3 player,"I bought this phone to use as a cheap music player, with no intention of activating a cell plan, so I can't reviewthe phone functionality. But it's a very good music player, and for the price, I think it's a great deal.In fact, I would say I got much more than I bargained for. So I will review this as a MP3 player.Pros:Standard music player is good, perhaps not great, but easy enough to find and play from song list.(I tried Music Pro from the App Store, but that seemed to hang periodically, and I didn't like it any better)More than enough room for my small music library, but I also added a 4gig Micro SD card I had laying around.Adding music from a Windows desktop was simple, just drag and drop into Music folder.Wouldn't work on my Macbook, but there is an App in the iTunes for Windows 8 phones.Navigation is very responsive.Live tiles work well.Connect it to your home internet, and access the App Store, weather, email, maps for offline use later.Radio works well, with headphones plugged in(as does an iPod)Tried a few games, Asphalt 8 works well, very nice graphics, but the device did get very warmI tried Cortana, asked ""her"" to wake me up at a certain time, and it set an alarm. It understood my voicerequest the first time. I was impressed.Camera seems to work well, but I only tried indoor photos, so not the best lighting.Battery life(I need to test this a bit, but since I don't use it as a phone, my experiences may be irrelevant)Cons:(here's the part I really wanted to write about)These phones have problems with the side buttons, especially the power button. Mine was used,I got it extra cheap, but the power and up volume buttons don't work. I searched the internet,and others have had the same problem, usually after some time. There is a legit fix, albeit MacGyver-ish, butyou can make it worse by messing with it. So, that may be a show stopper for many.However, it was somewhat of a blessing for me. It sent me searching for touch alternatives tothe power button. There is a free app to turn off the device with a touch, and a free app to turnon the device with a double tap(app is called Touch.) I like this better than using the side button.It also only has a front facing camera, but I have no interest in taking selfies.So I give it minus 2 stars for having such crappy side buttons, but give 1 back becausethe touch is so nice, and I really like it a lot now. You can pay a lot more for an iPod touch,but I think this works just a well.",2014年8月1日 在美国审核
Good intro to Windows Phone but no front camera,"I bought this for my daughter for use on a trip during which we would be separated for extended periods of time.It is small so it is only really good for those with small hands.The screen is bright with better than average viewing angles and at this size everything is sharp.If you intend to use a prepaid plan with no data, you can, but it's not a supported configuration for real smartphones like these.With some configuration tweaks to the MMS settings you can enable unlimited picture and group messaging with an appropriate monthly plan.One other note that made me chuckle--while the phone comes with Skype and Windows Phone makes special arrangements for it, it does not support video because there is no front facing camera.This makes Skype rather useless unless you somehow have unlimited data and no voice plan, which is practically nobody at all.Without video I cannot see how one would would want to bother with Skype on a mobile phone unless maybe they have a Hotspot-only SIM card.It is a 4G LTE phone and the battery is barely able to keep up.Charging is slower than I expected and is best done overnight.Be sure to update all the way to Windows Phone 8.1.It will take a long time and at least two separate upgrades must be performed.The phone comes with a sticker covering the screen as delivered in the GoPhone package.The glue is very difficult to remove.The screen smudges badly but you might get used to it.",2015年1月19日 在美国审核
This phone will surprise you.,"So far this phone is much more than I expected. It is really a no brainer.For $19.99, I purchased this phone (on a lighting deal) with the intention of switching, from my current prepaidcompany, to At&amp;T next month.Although I can't give a review on how well the phone actually works for calling and text, I can tell you that it works great with my wifi.I was able to get right on, without the sim card in, and start using the windows interface and apps.It quickly initiated the download to windows 8.1 and I was off having fun, using it as a small tablet.I'm not a person who relies on my cell phone for all of my daily needs and actually never use it while at home.It may not come with all of the bells and whistles of a high end phone, but for my interests and uses and cost, It's far better than the small Samsung Illusion I own now.and may I mention...Cortana is great!!",2014年12月26日 在美国审核
Picked up for father in law,"Very simple to use after I set it up for my father in law.My wife had given him her Blackberry, but it was too much for him to keep up with.He didn't need a smart phone, because 'everyone else' has one.All apps are still on the phone, but they don't show up on the main screen as clutter because my father in law doesn't use that stuff or doesn't know how to use that stuff.Did not activate as a GoPhone, but cut the AT&amp;T SIM to fit in this.He gets a new phone for probably less than a contract phone AND he isn't on contract.I picked this because the battery can be replaced, I could add a microSD card and Win8 on a phone works pretty well (even though I hate it on the desktop).I could organize and resize the tiles (icons/visual buttons) on the phone to keep it simple.Screen is slightly better in sunlight than my iPhone 4.No noticable difference in colour (FYI, I'm not colour blind) compared to my iPhone.Resolution, at the distance we look at the phone, shows no difference either.Cover over the battery is a little cheap/flimsy, so I'm glad I picked up a case to protect it.Put a 32 GB microSD card in it so he has plenty of space for video and photos.Wifi worked fine with no problem.Turned off the data and trimmed his SIM card so AT&amp;T doesn't automatically charge (fine) him for having a smart phone.He can text and make calls, which is all he wanted in the first place.When he wants the wifi set up for home use, I'll do that.Prefer my iPhone GUI for music, but it's really personal taste.Music and videos play just as good on this.Touch screen has a film protector over it and still works without issue.",2013年10月3日 在美国审核
Great smartphone that can be used without a phone plan.,"This is the first smartphone I've bought because I have no interest in paying hundreds of dollars a year for a data plan. I wanted the abilities of a smartphone without paying a hefty monthly feel to the phone company. This phone satisfies that need. It provides a combined MP3 player, ebook reader, camera, video camera, game machine, GPS, and internet browser in a pocket sized device for barely the cost of a single month on a data plan. To use it as a standalone device, don't install the SIM card and turn off cellular data in Settings.Interestingly, it turns out that Windows 8 is a pretty good phone operating system. It's still a lousy computer OS.=============================================================Update on 1/19/15I've had the phone for a few months and am still impressed with it. It has three big advantages over other phones:1) It can do turn-by-turn GPS navigation without WiFi or a data plan. Simply download state and country maps to the phone to use use it as a GPS navigator.2) MixRadio is similar to Pandora in that it plays songs based on selecting favorite artists or by picking a pre-existing mix. The advantage is that the music is commercial free and can be downloaded into an offline mode that allows the music to be played without WiFi or a data plan.3) Can receive FM radio signals by using a wired headset. Local radio can be listened to without WiFi or a data plan.This is a great minitablet for an incredibly low price. I bought a bunch and handed them out as Christmas gifts to kids and adults who cannot afford smartphone data plans and they all love it.",2014年9月3日 在美国审核

Great low cost smartphone,"I bought this for $50, then bought a 64gb micro SD for under $40.I now use the 520 as a 72gb media player replacing my Zune HD.It also serves as a backup phone for my AT&amp;T sim.The only cheap phone that might have a similar value is the Moto G for $179.For under $150, there is nothing even close.Pros:- Price, price, price.And it's actually a pretty good phone.- Windows Phone 8 is a simple, easy to use OS and runs smoothly on the hardware.- Actually has some accesories available since sales have been pretty good.- Hardware specs pretty good for price.- Micro SD card slot for additional memory- Removable battery- Nokia maps and navigation programs are great.You can download worldwide maps and use the device even if it is not connected to the internet.Cons:- only 512mb system memory imposes some limits.Most people will not notice.- No flash and average camera.The weak LED flashes are pretty useless anyway.- No front facing camera- WP8 app limitations.Remember this is a phone that sells in the US for as little as $40 with no contract.If you are expecting it to work like a $700 iPhone or Galaxy S4, you will be dissapointed.If you want a high end phone, but want to save money, get an on-contract for $200.",2014年2月20日 在美国审核
Which is better Lumia 520 or 521?,Awesome phone especially for the price and you don't have to have a contract!This was my first smartphone and it was a great experience.It allowed me to check emails fast and do other things well.Great phone but AT&amp;T is a little expensive in their plans so I ended up unlocking this phone (AT&amp;T unlocked it for me for free) and using it with T-mobile.It worked with T-mobile but the data had some minor problems with the T-mobile network so I ended up getting the Lumia 521 which is almost an identical phone.Differences between the Lumia 520 and 521:Lumia 520:520 is slightly smaller in lengthHas a dark gray backside (almost black)optimized for AT&amp;TLocked to AT&amp;T unless otherwise specifiedAT&amp;T will unlock it with little hassleFits into the 521 case with a little extra wiggle roomContains a Go-phone sim includedEven when unlocked wouldn't process T-mobile dataLumia 521:Has an off-white backsideoptimized with T-mobile networkT-mobile makes you jump through a few hoops to unlock this oneMost cases you buy online (even if they say they are for the 520) are actually made for the 521Contains a T-mobile sim cardI think this one has a headset capability not available in the 521 (not sure)A little bit of a pain to set up because of T-mobile but once it was set up no major issuesCONCLUSION:I would get the 521 because T-mobile has a cheaper monthly rate.The 521 doesn't look as good because of the off-white backside but you can get a case for $5 (see my other review) and cover up the back.Note: Don't let the T-mobile (or AT&amp;T) rep con you.There should be no activation/set-up fee.They both come with sim cards and you should be able to do it yourself.,2013年11月18日 在美国审核
Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone (AT&amp;T),"The coverage issue aside, I love this phone. It's snappy, the screen is beautiful. It's my first smartphone and I don't miss the plethora of apps available on iOS and Android phones, therefore. I'd never buy an iOS phone because they don't support SD cards, pure and simple. Android, I'm told, is unnecessarily complex. The one phone I considered besides this was the Moto G, but it too does not support SD cards, the best option being 16GB internal memory. I already ordered a 32GB Sony class 10 card for my Nokia 520.The offline GPS is a major reason I got this. I've tested that and it's great! Next to me is the dedicated Garmin Nuvi 2595LMT GPS I bought (in its unopened package) which I'm going to return to Costco in a few days.Would easily be 5 stars if AT&amp;T coverage were decent around here, however it's anything but, and this phone is locked to AT&amp;T's network. The 521 was not a smart option because reviews of T-Mobile coverage for this region are as abysmal as AT&amp;T's. If you ask just about anyone around here who their carrier is, they will tell you ""Verizon."" In fact, in my informal poll of people I see using their smartphones (I ask people once in a while), since I got my Nokia 520 a couple of weeks ago, all of them (8) said ""Verizon."" I can usually get a 1/2 decent data connection away from the house. In the house, it's a little iffy, especially downstairs.Tip: If you don't expect or want to receive any calls for a period (e.g. after going to bed), change to Airplane Mode and the battery will run down MUCH more slowly. I can go days without charging when it's in airplane mode, not so otherwise.",2014年3月11日 在美国审核
Who Says It Has To Be Used As A Phone?  It Works Quite Well As Just An Inexpensive 8GB MP3 Player.,"While I missed the earlier deals ($20, I think), I took the plunge at $29.99.The more I thought about it, the more I realized what a great deal it was.I paid at least as much for a refurbished Sandisk Sansa Clip 2GB MP3 player.I have an Android phone with another cell service provider, so I use this not as a phone, but as an MP3 player, sports scores tracker, alarm clock &amp; reminders, occasional calculator, quick browsing, and a few other things.The one-function Sansa Clip was relegated to the junk box.As to the operating system, it came with Windows Phone 8 (WP8) which was easily upgraded to WP8.1 over my wireless network.To say that I'm not a fan of Microsoft's OSes is putting it mildly - I run Linux only except for one laptop that dual boots with Win7.However, WP8.1 runs really well on this thing.It's surprisingly snappy and easy to use even when compared to my Android phone.The app store is pretty short of virtually anything I find useful - Free42 RPN calculator, CPU-Z, decent file manager, unit conversions program, &amp;c. - so I might end up porting what I can and coding what I must, just as I've done in Android &amp; Linux, then side loading the apps. &lt;shrug&gt;Depends mainly on the cost of WP8.1 development tools.They're 100% free when coding for Linux/Android.In any case, it's an excellent deal and works quite well for my purposes.",2015年2月12日 在美国审核

Most of the buyers of these phones throw the packing materials in the garbage, and some of them land on the sidewalk or street, or somewhere they are not supposed to be. The sharp edges of the packing are not child friendly, at times can be harmful.Using simple recycled paper boxes for packing the Gophones is not only the way to save the future of Earth. We have only one Earth. The future generation would like to see the planet the way it is now, or better and not polluted.The study says the hard plastics take more 20 years to decompose some of them stay forever.Even the Earth has limited resources, not meant to last forever.AT&amp;T can make great contribution by changing the way of the Gophone packing from hard plastic to paper boxes.Some of the prepaid mobile companies have already started using paper boxes.Save the Earth and Go eco-friendly.Thanks for your time.----------------------------their email address is attcustomercare@att.comThanks.",2013年8月18日 在美国审核
Great Way To Enter Or Try Smart Phone Tech. . .  Low Cost Tips For Us Low Usage Folks.,"FIRST: This phone is tops for those who are low use users (250 to 500 minutes voice &amp; 500MB data) OR want a low cost back up phone. You CAN buy unlimited voice and text and MORE data if you wish, but do not HAVE to. :-)For this phone, I just signed up for an online account and used a prepaid card. The instructions do not tell you that you can do this. Once you have an open account, you can just use prepaid cards which have a 90 day life once activated. Also , look closely at the plan/usage options on the page. The higlighted ones are $40 and $60. But there is even a $25 plan (as of this date writing) which gives you 250 minutes voice a month and you can buy data in $5 increments.I just buy the prepaid cards and enter the pin into my online account myself. I buy the cards on sale for $2 to $3 less than the face value. I can enter in a card pin and adjust my usage and plans accordingly at any time if I will be using the phone more. . . on a monthly basis. Also, if I buy a $45 card and use only $30, I have a credit of $15 which is good for 90 days so I can buy a lesser card next time or, save up two cards of residual credit and NOT have to buy a card for the third month. Entering in a pin monthly online is very easy. There is also a $25 per month plan online that you can add more data to in $5 increments. I use that now since I am not a heavy data user. The $25 plan is only 250 minutes voice but I usually don't even use that.",2014年8月28日 在美国审核

A great basic Windows Phone,"We had recently replaced a Lumia 520 for my father-in-law to replace his lost flip phone. He was uncomfortable with using a smart phone but after using it for awhile he's grown to like it to the point that he's now asking for more features! This phone is a great step up from a flip phone because for one the price is appealing and in my opinion the Windows Phone tiles is basic and simple enough for those intimidated by the smart phone. The tile design in Windows Phone 8 is great because I set the two most important functions/tiles, the phone and phone book, large and up top. He no longer has to bust out his reading glasses to see the buttons because now he has a larger screen to look at, which by the way is just a tiny bit larger than the iPhone 5.The timing is great as well because the latest OS update, Windows Phone 8.1, has just been released and most of the features that should have been on the phone are now there such as a notification area and speed dial. As for the apps, the ones we felt he really needed were there such as the banking app, Skype, Waze, and Netflix. HBOGo would have been nice but he can watch that on the big screen.I actually had the Lumia 920 when it was first released but decided to go back to an iPhone because of a lack of apps. A year and half later it's a different story and they have most of the key apps and so I decided to get me one to play with! I still use my iPhone but I just purchased a sim card adapter so I can switch between the phones whenever my mood changes. I will admit that the ability to add a 32GB SD card for extra memory is one major plus over my iPhone.",2014年8月21日 在美国审核

"Awesome phone with ample apps , good features, and overall a satisfactory user experience","This phone, considering the current selling price (69.99$), is worth more than the money spent on it. Here are the reasons why:1. Its a smart phone and comparable with any smartphone out in the market. Not just in the price range of $100 but with those sold for $200-300. The windows app store is not right there with apple or android app store but it offers most of the commonly used apps such as Pandora, you tube, whats app, wechat, Facebook, Google maps, etc.2. Nice and smooth browsing experience. Its just $70 and it makes you feel like you have a high end phone.3. The Nokia apps for GPS and music are freaking awesome. Music browsing features and associated options are very user-friendly. Nokia music app lets the user to create his own music mixes while also letting the user to download up to four mixes which can be used offline. Isn't it awesome, huh?4. Storage: This phone comes with 8 GB on-board storage capacity, which is good for storing as many apps that a regular person could use. Moreover, it supports micro SD cards up to 64 GB, which is humongous to store loads of music.5. The only thing i would have preferred to have is a high capacity battery. This phone is equipped with a 1430 mAh battery which could last no more than one day. I wish it had a higher capacity battery, and wouldn't have regretted paying $15-20 for that. But, given the price, battery is good too.Verdict: 4.5/5, and the deduction of 0.5 is for the lack of satisfactory battery life. Overall, i really like the phone. I purchased $150-200 worth phones before and no phone had given me a better experience than Nokia Lumia 520.",2013年11月26日 在美国审核
"Great Phone for the price, but not built to last","So I've gone through three of these phones now.For the money, they're great.But there are a few problems that always seem to crop up after about six months:1) The sleep button fails.I disassembled two of the phones, and both times, the solder holding the button to the mainboard had failed.At first, the button gets flakey, then it almost completely stops working.Eventually, it falls into the body of the phone.This button needs to be mounted to the board with something other than it's two electrical terminals. Resoldering is only mildly helpful - get another month or two out of the phone.2) The USB connector fails.USB connections get flakey.The connector outlasts the sleep button, so I've never had one fail entirely, since the phone needs to be replaced.Please note these phones weren't heavily abused-- I've been getting them for my elderly mother.Still, I've gotten them for as cheap as $20, and it's hard not to just buy another one when the previous one dies since most phones seem to cost &gt; $200.With Windows Phone's backup feature, setting up a new phone hardly takes any time at all.All the apps reinstall themselves and photos sync.",2015年5月15日 在美国审核

Data Sense available but it will void your warranty.","Got two of these at a seriously low price, then saw the price drop even further within a few days, amazon being the pros that they are refunded me the difference almost immediately, hands down... the best customer service on the planet.I bought this version of the Nokia Lumia 520, you may or may not know but AT&amp;T did not allow for their branded 520s to take all the Amber updates (GDR2) that were available, namely the Data Sense function that tracks your data usage, maps local hotspots and limits background data consumption when you are near your set limits. This function is currently available on Verizon and T-Mobile but instead AT&amp;T offers a bookmark to their ""MyAT&amp;T"" page which actually makes you use your data to see how much you've used.To get this you will need to flash your phone with a CV (Country Variant) ROM, once you do this is done and you get all the goods. I won't get into the details of it but just know that it is an option and google can be your friend. This will certainly void your warranty (but flashing back to it's original ROM should right the ship so be sure to have that before you begin).Throw in a monthly unlimited Talk/Text and 500MB data plan for only $30 and I'm sold, I use Wi-Fi most of the time but if I needed unlimited data I could always upgrade to the $50 monthly.The difference between this phone and the T-Mo branded one (521) besides the $10-$20 price difference is that that phone is unlockable right out of the box, with this one you will have to wait for after at least six months of continuous service on AT&amp;T. This may be a deal breaker for some but not for me. Oh and the 521 is slightly longer.So if you're into saving money and like the idea of owning a smart phone outright, wait no more... this is your phone.",2013年12月19日 在美国审核
Nice phone for a cheap price!,"I'm going to make this review as informational as possible and give a decent description of what you can expect with this phone.It will ship with two charging cables, one a very long cable that plugs into a standard wall outlet-the other is an extremely short USB charger. There is a battery shipped with the phone as well. The phone also includes a Mini Sim (or micro sim, whatever) which is what this phone requires. The phone also has expandable memory via a MicroSD card of up to 32 GB with an internal storage of around 6 GB of usable space. Pretty good if you ask me. Please note the Nokia Lumia 520 does not include a MicroSD card. You can also remove the back cover of the phone as well as the battery and such.The phone runs on Windows 8 OS, and it's very sleek and simple for the average phone user; however, similar to Android it has a decent amount of customization (although not to the extend of Android.) The live tile system is quite nice to look at and the OS is rather intuitive. There is little to no lag whilst using the phone for everyday uses, but some apps may run a bit slower as this phone doesn't have the best specifications. The camera is 5 MP I believe, however there is no camera above the screen, nor is there a flash on the back side of the phone.All in all, this phone is very cost effective for what you are paying. You can use it as a primary smart phone, or a backup phone in cases of emergencies. It functions very well and gives you a very good taste of what the W8 OS has to offer.Some problems or cons this phone has:- The headphone jack may be faulty on your phone. I had to ship one of mine back because both the headphone jack and the charging port stopped working correctly for some reason- Odd screen feeling. It doesn't feel like the high-end smartphones, and in my experience my finger doesn't slide across the screen as easily and creates more smudges. Perhaps it's just me.- No flash or front-facing cameraI hope I've helped anyone that had any questions or concerns about purchasing this phone. Again, I would recommend this phoneto anyone looking for a nice GoPhone without running you or your family into poverty. The support at Amazon is great whenever I had to return my phone. I would buy this for a young child's first phone or something similar, as this is an extremely safe purchase at the low price in the event that it gets lost or broken.Thanks for reading!",2014年5月21日 在美国审核
"Great phone, even greater price.","Purchased this phone for use with our existing at&amp;t account.We decided to get away from contracts, so no more ""free"" phones.It is a micro sim, so i had to cut down my sim.Plenty of directions on youtube, wasn't a problem.I love the windows 8 os.I'm old, my brain works better on windows.This phone does everything i need and more for $30.Haven't had any memory issues but i don't have many games and i do have a 16gb micro sd.

"It's Brilliant ! 2 days in use and finding it nice, probably an under rated phone somehow","Got one to try it out (AMZN had it for $40 deal of the day). Current price around $60 is not bad at all. Having used iOS and Androd Devices, I wanted to try out Windows 8 phone given that it can easily 'sync' with the other MS apps used at work. First thing, while I am no brand fan or anything, infact hesitated to buy a Nokia after my previous bad experience with them, I was pleasantly surprised at the Device and the OS. The Win8 Live tile interface is infact brilliant, somehow like it better than IOS or Andriod. While iOS is all simplicity, no surprises, Win 8 is a different experience in a nice way I think. The build quality of the phone is not to iPhone or Galaxy / HTC standards, but not bad at all for a less than $100 phone. The Snapdragon processor is very fast, as fast as any other device, multitask well, uses the battery well, photo quality is pretty good even in low light for cell phone standards. I like being able to open all the MS Office attachments in native format - a major plus for office work. The Nokia Music and Free Radio apps are very good. I already use Win 8.1 at home and it is very much the same.Anyone considering a fancy expensive phone for their kids have a very viable, alternate option in this phone.Also if you already have a AT&amp;T or TMobile plan (the TMobile version of this phone) it is easy to swap it with your current phone.

bluetooth not working yet but further a fine phone,"got this phone because it was cheap . That said and the fact that this is my first smart phone I like it picture quality is very good compared to my Samsung flip phone . There is stuff I got to get used to but that's more me then the phone . It will last a day sometimes two on a charge and I'm not a heavy user some sms mostly talk and a little internet . phone is fast enough for internet that it doesn't drive you bonckers to find something . You can get a zerolemon big battery for about 32 bucks that lasts 3-4 days so I ordered that . We will see how that works .Not the easiest phone to enter new contacts in but maybe it's me . The only real gripe I have is Bluetooth is not working with my Parrot CK3100 car kit or with my Samsung rugby flip phone . This seems to be a bit of an issue with this phone ,and other lumia's, when you search onlineabout this problem . Given my car kit is 5 years old and maybe a software update will help . If so I will update this review . Protective cases are very affordable too so Yes I think it is a fine phone . And I'm hard on phone so I figure if I break this a new one doesn't break the bank . If you are a total techy person this phone is probably not the one to pick but for a easy user it does fine . And hopefully I can get Bluetooth up and running",2014年8月16日 在美国审核
I had to change from my old Samsung dumb phone to this Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone,"I had to change from my old Samsung dumb phone to this Nokia Lumia 520 GoPhone. I paid less than $50 for this Smart Phone. It is the cheapest I can find that meets all my requirements. It comes shipped on a clear sealed plastic container with the charger, usb adapter and the microSim card and instructions.The changeover was so easy. I called the number stated on the instruction to call if you are currently an ATT Wireless user. It already comes with a micro SIM card that you have to tear off from a credit card sized plastic piece. I opened the back of the phone, plugged the micro Sim card into the slot - read the manual , then plugged in the battery included, closed the back cover. I then plugged the adapter first to charge the battery like they recommend to do. Then I called ATT and somebody answered and guided me step by step until I was connected to my wireless router, logged in with the wireless password to get a WIFI connection, they basically made sure the phone was able to call out and receive voice and text messages before they let me go. I just have toread the IMEI number from the back of the new phone and also number on the microSim card. One thing I learned is that this is classified as a Smart Phone. It requires a Data Plan. You cannot use this phone without a data plan like your old flip phone.There are lots of plan choices with ATT. I only need the small data plan of 300MB per month. I use my WIFI connection when i am at home. I don't use that much data when i am away from home. Make sure you set the alarm for data usage so that you will be warned when you are about to exceed your data plan. Otherwise, you will be charged extra bucks per GB of data you over use. All i do is check emails which was so easy to setup. It automatically updates my email without having to plow through the process of logging in with the password everytime. Text messaging is so convenient. All i do is go to the People app, choose my recepient, choose to call or text. I just tap on the glass display twice and it wakes up my phone and display comes to life. The battery lasts a lot longer than i expected.The phone is so slick. The only thing you will not like is the fact that you have no camera at the front. I don't take selfies anyway. So, it will be weird to do Skype with this phone.They won't see you during video conversations. Audio only conversations will be just fine as long as you can be heard clear. You won't be able to see yourself on Skype. The 5 megapixel photo and video camera functions great and the recently taken photos and videos are easily accessed right after taking them. I bought a 64GB microSD. I placed all my MP3 music files in it so I can listen to them wherever I go. Also, the downloaded apps, photos and videos and can go directly to the microSD and not to the built in 8GB of the phone. You need this microSD if you like to take photos and videos, otherwise your phone will run out of space very quickly. It is so easy to manage the microSD once installed in the phone. It automatically creates folders to sort out your Photos, videos and Documents.After taking it for a spin and using it for a day, I decided to upgrade this phone to Windows Phone 8.1 like they recommend. It was updated step by step by going to the settings and phone update section. I had to go through three updates one after the other from Windows Phone 8.0 which took about 5 to 10 minutes each until I got to 8.10.The last update brought lots of surprises including the Cortana app. You would want this app. This matches the SIRI app on the Iphones and other Smart phones. It makes my life easier by allowing me to dictate commands over this phone. I can speak to it by saying "" Call home"", as long as you have a home phone number on your contact list, it will dial your home number. You can practically dictate your messages instead of typing them to send as a text message. This is so convenient when replying long text messages. I am surprised by the way it automatically types everything i say.The ring tones are fantastic. They give you a bundle of choices, not just 8 or 10. By the way, it also has Office access to Word, Excel and Power Point files. Custom alarms are plenty. I had it set to remind me when it is my break time and when the break is over. I do the same for lunch and the second break time. This phone wakes me up with great alarm sounds I have never heard before. I listen to music all night long when I am at home when I have WIFI connection.You can download free apps from the Store. Pandora app is great for continuous music of your choice of genre. I also use the Bank Of America app to access my bank account. I just need to log in my password everytime for security. I can also access online podcasts of daily Bible talks that i missed listening on AM radio such as Rick Warren's Daily Hope podcast. Google and Wikipedia apps works just great for doing quick information searches.I like this phone. I would probably buy another Nokia Lumia Windows Phone. It meets all my expectations at such a great low price. You wanna get a nice rugged protective case than will also protect the glass face. This is no Gorilla glass. A word of warning - do not drop this baby. Take care of it like your eyeglasses. Enjoy your new Nokia Lumia 520 Smart Phone. It is a keeper.",2014年9月19日 在美国审核
Very happy with phone but not AT&amp;T,"This is my first smart phone. I am very happy with it. Easy to operate, user-friendly and took me a only a little while to figure everything out. I am not happy with AT&amp;T though. I have had to contact them several times to ask questions about their GoPhone features such as minutes and data. I have still not used the data from AT&amp;T and keep using only wifi connection. I switched to data from ATT and it said I need to add minutes on my phone when I already have over 200 minutes at the time. Will try to switch service but the phone is a great buy and I highly recommend it.-------------------UPDATE ON 12/23/2014------------I bought 3 more of these phones as gifts for family over the past 3 months. The last two have been terrible with poor battery life. My husband's phone was bought only last month blacks out completely even when it has been well charged and on full battery. He push-holds the power button to turn it back on but that doesn't work either. Only removing the battery and inserting it again powers it back on. You can never tell at what moment it will black out. The other one I bought for my son has a poor battery life too. It's not activated yet and he almost never uses it but even when fully charged and on stand by the battery goes down in 4 to 6 hours.",2014年4月9日 在美国审核

Nokia Lumia 520,"**This phone is used as a backup to my Note 2**Purchased this phone when they first dropped the price to $59.99 as I tend to screw up my phone quite often.Most of my use with this phone comes when my primary phone was sent away for warranty.The #1 reason I chose this phone over others for my backup is because of the price. I Also wanted to try a windows phone as I was intetersted in their higher class phones but was not sure I would like the windows system.Now besides the obvious differences between the windows,android and iphones I have listed what I like and dislike about this phone.Likes -Its simple and easy to use.Nokia Apps (The Camera &amp; GPS apps are lovely and have to be its biggest selling points.)Not sure what to call it but the Shazzam equivalent feature on the search page. Very easy to use and bring/call upColor customization without having to root/ and or hack the iphone/androidOverall the phone is pretty great for its price. The speed and handling of the phone is great for what im using the phone as.It has already served its purpose as a serviceable backup as long as you are not expecting it to be a super phone.Cons -Have to be the appstore. How certain apps work compared to other devices seems to be lacking. Also has lack certain apps that I use daily would have to be its biggest draw.BUT this phone is primarily my backup and the cons that I have will not bother me enough to change my phone out.I am still willing to try out the more expensive models once im giving the chance but until the time comes, this phone will be perfectly fine.",2014年2月5日 在美国审核
This phone rocks!,"Purchased as a backup phone.The size and weight is perfect.The phone has a really good feel.Upgraded Windows and all, took a little while, but no biggie.Cortana Rules!I prefer Microsoft Office... and absolutely love Outlook.com.No more mix and match cross referencing.One single solution that works across all my devices.All contacts, emails, etc, visible on all devices and computers whether using the actual software, or using the web clients.Office Lens is amazing as is One Note. (especially with the OCR for whiteboards etc.Look this up if you never heard of it.) The camera works just fine and there is plenty of software to meet my needs.This phone also lets you replace the battery and add memory.W/ATT Pricing... and this phone for under $50 you can not beat it.(Also, One drive works great, as does Camera Roll for automatically backing up pictures.)I would like to add my brother uses the phone as well.He called me yesterday and did a three way call with a friend.It was the most crystal clear conversation I have ever had with him.. ever.I was using the Lumia 925 he was using this 520 phone.Ten times better than his iPhone 4 that broke.",2014年11月23日 在美国审核
love this phone,"Bought on amazon deal of the day so it was $40 instead of $120 ( 8 gig). We use them as a prepaid, no data, so we no longer have or old plan that was $65 per month. Thought pre paid would be a hassel, but after the first month went to automatic refills. thought ten cents per minute would add up, but if you only bs on your home phone like us we both used less than $5 total ($1.60 month) in our first three months. Love how it sinks all of your contact lists with all ofyour computers. Many of the apps you can load on wifi still work without data plan. Compass, location, gps, maps, sky chart, camera apps. and many more. Out of the box the battery life was bad, but when you upgrade from windows 8 to 8.1 and go to nokia site and tweek some settings, in standby the battery lasts about a week if on 24/7. Music is great stored on a micro card and either blue tooth or wire to speaker. sound same as wife's ipod.

Great phone for the price,"First I want to say that I am not a fan of Windows Phones at all.In fact I really dislike them.I owned a Lumina 820 a few months ago that's LCD screen died, and I was actually pretty happy that it did so I could move on to something else.My problem with windows phones is not the OS, it is the app market, and that has not improved at all in the past few months since my previous windows phone died on me.So why did I buy this?Quite simply it was because if the price.I still have 11 must months to go on my contract and the phone I was using became very unreliable.When it came down to it I needed a reliable phone to hold me over for a few months, and for $59 the Lumina 520 was too good a deal to pass up.I does the basic things that I need from a phone, I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, so I have to give it 5 stars.Windows phone 8 runs beautifully on this device.It accepted my 32gb micro SD card with no problems.Give me some apps that really let me take control of my phone and I could become a big fan of Windows Phone...The only con from the phone hardware itself is the lack of a flash for the camera.I understand that Nokia wanted to keep the price down on this phone, but led lights are so cheap that I feel they could have included it anyway.",2014年1月8日 在美国审核
"$50 for the phone, then $30 monthly!","I have been using my Lumia 520 for some time now, with H2O wireless (no contract). At first pay as you go, and now a monthly package. I had an Android phone before (Pantech Burst) , which was okay, but it seemed like the e-mail and messaging was all botched together. I missed calls, appointments and texts w/ Android.This Nokia w/WindowsPhone 8.1 is well integrated and very customizable. The phone doesn't exhibit the sluggishness of my earlier Android unit. The home-screen now displays everything I want. The touchscreen is responsive, and the body of the phone is, Oh so thin. Protective case choices are limited.Don't order a case that says it fits the 521 AND the 520. The 521 is the Sprint version of the phone and is dimensionally larger. The 520 will rattle around in the case and the holes for buttons and such won't line up properly. Sound quality of this phone is very good, both transmit and receive.

Why a Windows phone??,"Why did I get a Windows phone?!?!I do enjoy several things, like easy integration with Windows 10 for computers, syncing to the cloud, integration with Outlook/Live.I wish more app developers would develop on this platform, however since the masses are going with iOS and Android, this will never happen.Now the bad.... I wish a smartphone would be a phone first, and a computer second.When i want to make a call, i wake it up, type my pin code, wait for it to finish waking up, close whatever app i was last in, click the phone icon, wait for it to load, then either hit the contact list and search, or hit the keypad button to finally get to a phone.Sometimes 20 to 30 seconds after i picked it up.It's also very prone to the famous Microsoft random crashes.Often I click on an app, watch the ""Resuming"" message for 5 to 10 seconds, followed by being thrown back to the apps menu/tiles.And good luck with Youtube videos.Decode error randomly shows after you start watching a video.I will most likely go back to Android after I officially go crazy from this phone, even though Android suffers similar issues.But for a price cheaper than a 6 year old abused iPhone, you have a smartphone.It was fun to use and to experience for a little while.",2015年12月8日 在美国审核
Don't be fooled by the price,"This phone is at such an incredible value it almost seems too good to be true. Well I'm here to tell you it's not. Between the money you save on this compared to other brands of smartphones on the market and by using AT&amp;T's gophone service it will seem silly to ever buy a phone through a contract agreement. The call quality is excellent on this phone, and as far as the touchscreen responsiveness I think it is spot on with devices 5x it's price. The autocorrect is a great feature when typing a text but unlike Apple it doesn't just correct you right away it gives you different options that you may select from, allowing you to type quickly and insert words if needed. (Such as if you're typing thank you/thanks/etc)The camera is great, and it has an autofocus and stabilizer, as if you were using a real camera! Once you take a photo there are more options available to edit the photo other than filters, and with the creative studio app you can highlight, erase, or blur the background within seconds. (As if you had a PhotoShop app)I love this phone, and I'm sure you will too, so don't hesitate on this one and be ready to break free of Apple's shackles and enjoy no restrictions or limitations in the process.",2013年12月29日 在美国审核
"Super SmartPhone, Incredible Value!","Incredible value in a smartphone! I highly recommend it as one of the best budget smartphones on the planet today. Currently, for a bit more money, I'd go for the Lumia 635.For comparison, I've owned an iPhone 4 (and an iPad), and I now own the 2013 Moto X Android phone (and a 2013 kindle fire HD 7).This Lumia 520, especially for the low price, is a great device, and Windows Phone OS 8.1 is excellent. I now prefer Windows Phone OS over Android and way over iOS.I bought the Lumia 520 as a backup phone and to try out Windows Phone OS - love it - upgraded for free to 8.1 over wi-fi without ever installing the SIM card.I'm using this phone simply as a media device.PROS--Great built-in FM radio!-Great built-in podcasts app!-Cortana is great! Fast, accurate, useful (over wi-fi; not tried over 4G).-xbox music app is good.-All audio works great with the screen turned off, volume controls still work, and you can adjust volume and play/pause from the lock screen.-Battery life is fine, lasts mostly all day, charges pretty fast.-Outlook email, contacts/people, calendar, tasks, reminders - all excellent, especially if you already use them otherwise and have a Microsoft account.-OneDrive and OneNote super good.-Fast app switching works great.-Notification pull down works great.-Live Tiles are the best!-SIM slot-SD Card slot-Windows Phone App Store has almost all the major or popular apps - has all you really need - even games.-Final Fantasy III game runs perfectly smooth on this budget Lumia 520!-Screen quality is very good, text is crisp. Colors are accurate.-Device size is great, not too big or too small.CONS--Camera quality is decent but not great, however the camera/camera app features (all the Nokia Lumia apps) are excellent.-Screen is only 4 inches; bigger would certainly be better.-At 512 MB RAM with a dual-core, the system runs acceptably and is stable, and at times it runs fast, fluid, and smoothly. But maybe half the time it feels a tad sluggish with a ""Loading..."" or ""Resuming..."" screen. But at the super low budget price, it is perfectly fine and all you really need. And it only feels sluggish at times if you're coming from a mid-range or flag-ship phone.-Build quality fit/finish noticeably refined than a high-end phone, but it seems sturdy enough and one can't complain at the cost. The hardware quality is reliable, made by Nokia.-Any weather app I use does not update the live tile until after I open the app, which defeats the purpose of a live weather update. But other live tiles update regularly. This is a minor issue to me.CONCLUSIONFor all that this phone does and can do, compared to contract phones or mid-range or flag-ship phones, this Lumia 520 is an amazing value and overall a great device. Highly recommended. It can do pretty much everything the fancier phones can do but at a huge fraction of the cost!!Buy several of them for each of your kids, or buy two at once: one to use and one for backup! Or buy it just to give Windows Phone OS and the Windows App Store a try. It's so affordable, so if it breaks, just buy another one!Came in the original plastic packaging from AT&amp;T. Includes a sync cable, a wall charger, a SIM card.UPDATEMore Pros--Camera shutter button is a surprise. Not only is there a dedicated camera button, but it functions the same as a ""real"" camera: press it half-way down to get focus lock, then press all the way to snap the picture. Super nice feature and on a budget phone.-Super sensitive screen also a surprise and it works well. Tried thick leather gloves and could still operate the touch screen. Wow!",2015年2月5日 在美国审核
"Great MP3 Player, plus more","I bought this for my wife who does not own a smart phone due to overpriced required data plans. She wanted a cheap but good MP3 player. This is a great MP3 player and significantly cheaper than anything comparable to it. You can use a microSD card as well to increase the storage if you like. It also comes with Nokia Music (edit: now called Nokia Mix Radio), so if you are at a gym with wifi you have a great selection of free music available to you. Plus you could use one of several other standard popular music apps if for some reason the Nokia music app didn't meet your needs. The Nokia apps really seem to make this device.You also do not need to be on a data plan to use the maps that come with the device.The calendar and other Windows apps are nice. It sounds as if the upcoming 8.1 update may possibly fix the issue with Google calendars syncing to it. The camera took a bit of learning but I would say it competes with most other smart phone cameras and cheap compact cameras.I can not review the actual phone ability or AT&amp;T service because we did not buy it for that reason and have not ever used it for that. To my understanding you can pay for that and it appears to be very affordable in comparison to most contract plans.",2014年3月7日 在美国审核
Great cheap phone.,"I like this phone very much. I am not a technophile but I like the windows system. The phone came loaded with WP 8.1 and works very fast. I switched from an iPhone, and was always disappointed with it. The Bluetooth never worked as well as the earliest Nokia Iused in the 1990s. This phone sinked effortlessly and works flawlessly with the Bluetooth device in my car. The apps are plenty enough for me. Pandora works better than with the iPhone. It sinks easily with the laptop with a windows laptop app and transferred all my contacts and music from iTunes. It has a stand alone gps . You download maps for any state or country and get turn by turn driving directions without using Data. It automatically switches from data to Wifito save on your data usage. I connected with PureTalk Wireless and use very little data so it is very cheap. I don't stream movies or watch videos so I can't say how well that stuff works. For what I use the phone for it works well and you can't beat the price.",2015年4月24日 在美国审核
"Perfect for kids or anyone who needs a good, low-cost smartphone","A great, inexpensive phone.Very responsive, completely usable, and most of the key apps we need.The perfect phone for a kid who needs to communicate and coordinate with parents, siblings, and classmates.A little background...We have a 13 year old year old son and we need him to have a phone especially to coordinate transportation to/from school and sports.So calendar, phone, text messaging, and email are all essential.Unfortunately he was managing to lose or break his phone every couple of months or so.With the more expensive smart phones, it was killing us every time he lost one - especially on contract.While we would have preferred to take away his cell phone privileges until he could keep better track of a phone, for safety and to find him we need him to have one with him.With these relatively inexpensive phones, while we are not happy when he needs a new one, at least the cost is contained.We also know people who use these as their ""going out phone"" for the small size and low cost - at around $50 on special it doesn't break the bank if it gets lost.",2014年8月22日 在美国审核
"Phone = Awesome, Windows not so much.","I don't normally write low ratings on a product but here it is.First off the Nokia Phone is amazing! I love the layout of the buttons, simplicity of the frame to manage SD storage and sim card. Where they went wrong was with putting Windows on it. At first working with Windows 8.1 was nice, I liked the layout, connectingwith the cloud and managing my office documents on the mobile along side with the computer.Worked great until a month later, 5gb of data into the phone my wifi became spotty and continually switch to my cell data. The solution was to delete my saved wifi on the phone and reconnect. After a few days of that the phone would no longer connect to the internet through WiFi, it connects with limited access. . .another way of saying no internet connection. No solution can be found because thedesktop version of windows 8.1 has the same issue. So, until this is resolved I'm forced to go back to my flip phone *sad face.",2015年1月28日 在美国审核
best phone I have owned,"we moved to this phone from a android girlfriend had a fusion 2 and I was using a galaxy s2.We switched these over to straight talk as its much cheaper every month than the at &amp; t pre pay, andyou get the same thing.I wasn't sure we were going to like the windows format so we opted to get a cheaper phone, just to try the windows platform out.I am so glad we got this phone, The call quality is outstanding, on my old phone I had a hard time hearing exactly what some people said, on this phone I hear every word crystal clear.The connection to wi-fi is so easy with this phone and with this phone I finally use my facebook account (still think its way overrated and overused, but at least now I look at posts) because its so easy to use and set up.the live tiles are great and while everything is always right where it should be it never really looks the same.This phone does everything you could ask for, and then some, plus is does it very very well.there maybe allot fewer apps but the ones that you really use are there for this phone too.The only thing I have missed is a high quality camera with a flash, but this is the entry level phone and the camera does work well enough.",2014年1月29日 在美国审核
Nokia Lumia 520 Review,"So you have some perspective of this review let me say.... I'm am not a heavy phone user. I'm always late to the technology party. This phone is replacing a 'flip phone'. I've never texted. We were changing service from Sprint to Consumer Cellular so I had to shop for an unlocked phone. The price on this phone was very reasonable, so I figured I'd try a 'smart' phone and see how it goes.I've been really happy. It is surprisingly simple to operate. Windows 8 has not been a problem. It comes with One Note and that's a nice feature. There are decent instructions on-line and a printed sheet with the phone. It's not as small as a flip phone but fits in my jeans okay. I haven't tried any apps so I can't address how might work with them. My connections are much better I've only had one dropped call (although this may be do to the change in service - not the phone). Texting has been very easy - this phone has a built in microphone and speech recognition software so you can talk into the phone and as you do the phone types the message!! It does this incredibly well.The only feature I miss from my old phone is speed dial and the only feature I'm disappointed with is the camera. Not intuitive and focus/exposures are slow??",2014年4月3日 在美国审核
An astounding value!,"It is everything I had hoped for and more. I am more an android person and would probably like Apple if i wasn't economically restricted, but this phone is great. Nokia always made excellent hardware and the Windows Op is not bad at all. I like what they did with the live tiles. I am not a great fan of Win 8.0 on a regular computer - I do like the concept of the live tiles, that is still nice, but where the hell is my interactive desktop - couldn't I get that flipping a switch...no... supposedly 8.1 offers something there?Anyways, that is a different story, this phone is nice: What I miss most is a front facing camera for Skype - it can use the back one, well, factoring in the price what can I say... a flash might have been nice too ....and it doesn't have a hardware compass... so no ""flashlight"" app and no ""compass"" app will be working neither... well, still it is astounding what 99.- buys you these days. Great mp3 player, maps are awesome, gps is awesome, camera is great even without a flash does quite well in low light conditions - better than any point and shoot camera I ever used, phone is great, web browser is great, the hardware that is there generally is awesome... and don't mind me saying that live tiles on a small handheld device are nice... and well, I always liked the GoPhone service from AT&amp;T, so I am very happy. Oh, one more thing, first time I assembled the back the power button thingee wasn't aligned right: the switch itself is of course on the phone body but the button &amp; pusher is on the cover, it needs to align properly. One needs to be a little careful when putting the back on, I figured it out.",2013年11月6日 在美国审核
"Flawed, Buggy, &amp; Lack of Information Before Purchasing...","Defective, after dealing with ATT, and their attempts to correct the fact that there is no notification when I have a voicemail needing to be responded to, they realized it's a bug in this model phone by Nokia!They said they have not heard of Nokia correcting it, so it's useless to me, as I depend on being able to respond to calls ASAP, since they are often job requests. I've lost money because of this flaw, and the fact they know about it, yet still sell these phones, is pretty sleazy of Nokia!Also, there is nothing in their listing or description of what OS is required to do the simplest of computer-oriented things, like loading pics, mp3 files, contacts, etc.I have Mac OS 10.6.8, yet need 10.7 for anything to work. So, this has been a real bust for me. It's sad, because otherwise I like the phone. Although, lately, it seems the battery life has gone way down, and must be charged twice as often as it used to... I'll be getting a new phone asap.",2015年12月30日 在美国审核
AWESOME and WOW!,"OMGoodness, What is the big deal about IPhones when this Nokia smartphone is so AWESOME! It was easy to transfer my current plan and will be paying less with this phone. I just have to get used to not touching my screen as things moves (screen changes) very quickly. Honestly I believe I got a great deal on this phone and my friends say "" welcome to Today's World"" with the new phone. It comes with a sim card( or if the current one fits the new phone, move it to that) and just transfer the micro SD the new phone, download windows 8.1 for free.I am still getting used to it, and I see why the addiction on public transportation, so much you can do while riding home. Just be AWARE of your surrounding, it's the holiday season and there are Phone snatchers out there. I loved my ATT quick-fire Phone but I am loving my Nokia Lumia 520 AT&amp;T Go Phone.

Amazing phone especially for the price!!!,"O ordered this at best buy for my daughter a week or so ago then saw it on here first for 69 then 39 all the way up to 99 within days. When it dropped back to 59 I ordered myself one. A few hours later the price shot back up to 89. I really do t understand the dramatic fluctuation is prices for this phone. I've never seen it happen with any other product. Bottom line this phone is one of the best ones you can get right now. We use the straight talk service and it works great and they even now offer the 4g service so that's amazing! Its 3 times as good as the 100 dollar plus phones out there with many more features. So if you are looking for a fast, reliable, fun and sharp new unlocked, smart phone that won't break your bank account. Get this one! Try and wait for it to drop to at least the 59 range which it does. Still baffled by the price fluctuations on this though. FYI if you will be using this on the straight talk network make sure you buy the AT&amp;T micro SIM card thru straight talk or get it at Walmart for 7 dollars. Once you either switch your number thru that or creat a new one you will need to reset your VPN settings. The instructions are included with the micro SIM card. If you already have a micro SIM card you use thru straight talk you should be able to just use that. Enjoy the phone :)",2013年12月29日 在美国审核
the phone behaves like it has to do memory paging when I wakes ...,"Windows8.1 phone has features such as live icons but Windows8.1 OS itself isn't stable. After 2-3 days, the phone behaves like it has to do memory paging when I wakes up the phone. I think Windows simply run out of memory after running for a few days. I often have to reboot the Windows OS on the phone when it becomes semi unresponsive or wait for quite a while before Windows can page its memory to function properly.Using Windows8.1 on Windows phone is almost like using Windows98 on the desktop, having to reboot it every few days.I also have another Nokia Windows phone and if I just leave it running 24/7 showing a clock app only, Windows seems to be more stable. In other words, if I use Windows phone every day running a few apps, Windows OS simply runs out of free memory.As of writing this comment, Microsoft hasn't released Windows10Mobile for this phone.

"Great phone, such a surprise for such a cheap ...","Great phone, such a surprise for such a cheap product. This is an amazing phone. The windows 8.1 interface is excellent and easy to use. The screen is crisp and clear. Only gripe there is the screen size, coming in at about 4 inches, though not bad, it can look a bit small compared to a samsung galaxy, but thats understandable considering the price difference. Everything works as expected, no issues. It can play most games perfectly fine, with no lag, however it should be stated that this phone has only 512 gb of ram. Basically what this means is you cant play some games, such as Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which may make some people shy away, however, its not a huge issue, considering relatively few games require 1 gb of ram. The phone body is light, and does have a plastic feel to it, but thats not to say its bad. The phone is sturdy and feels great to hold. The camera isn't amazing, but it gets the job done. As for battery life, I can make this stretch out for most of the day, unless I am playing battery draining games like Assassins Creed, in which case the battery goes pretty quick. Overall an amazing, intuitive, and fun phone. Anyone who has an resilience to purchase this phone, I assure you, you wont be disappointing.",2014年12月24日 在美国审核
I can dig it,"For the price tag of 69.99, this is very much worth the price. As a Smart Phone user, I am not one of those people who spends every waking second on my Smart Phone. I use it when I need to check something, the occasional car ride, reading and email. Occasionally I'll play games but I lack the time for that. I probably use 1 GB of internet a month max.If you constantly are on your phone, this may not be the phone for you. It does not have the same APPs that Apple and Android possess, but if you just use your phone for social media, web surfing, and phone calls than this works fine.The speaker is very loud. So if you want to listen to Pandora, Fit Radio or Nokia Music, it's pretty good.GPS is free and does not use web.I got a case and it looks pretty cool.Windows 8 is not so bad on a mobile device. It's manageable as you can move the home screen around the way you want it.The memory is small but you can input an SD card to increase the memory.For the price of 69.99 and having all the apps that I need, I give it 5 stars",2014年2月2日 在美国审核
NO DATA PLAN NEEDED,"I have owned this phone for two months now.I replaced an old flip phone with a ATT GoPhone pay by the minute plan.I wanted some of the features of a smartphone and was greatly interested in the wireless access for accessing some of apps I like on my tablet but did not want to buy a data plan.I did not want to make a large investment and this smartphone fit the bill.Best phone purchase I have ever made. I am still on my ATT GoPhone pay by the minute plan with no data.I have found that there are even more free WIFI spots than I anticipated.I love several features offered by this phone.Audio announcements of incoming phone calls (by name if they are in your contact list, free severe weather alerts (Bing weather app), free amber alerts, front screen announcements of your next appointment (from my gmail calendar), the USA Today app keeps me up to date of breaking news and the ability to check my email (gmail) when I am out and about, picking up digital store coupons in store, and the ability to transfer / download music or even free audiobooks from the library.I can also access my Hulu Plus account and stream video as long as I have a strong enough signal.I actually use my phone more now than I ever did before but still only buying a $25 prepaid card every 3 months.The only problem I had with the phone was downloading pix from text messages but a quick call to ATT customer service and it was fixed quickly.Guess what phone the ATT customer service rep had?This one.I am looking forward to going on my next trip as I will add a data package for the month and take advantage of the Navigator features!A smartphone for $50 and $100 per year in prepaid cards...this phone makes great fiscal sense.You can barely find a decent flip phone for this price and you will enjoy the extra features.I have already saved the cost of the phone with the coupons that I downloaded in store.I am sure that I am not the only one who leaves home without my coupons.",2014年7月16日 在美国审核
Loving it so far,"Can't beat the price on this one! $69.99. After owning the phone for 2 weeks, I have to say it greatly exceeded my expectations. The OS is responsive and fast. The interface for all the apps is very consistent and minimalist. I don't need no fancy colors on my phone! The stock apps are all really good and well written. Battery life is stellar. The first charge pasted me 3 DAYS with the wifi and location services turned off. I also had batter saver on. As far as 3rd party apps, I am not a big app person. Even so, I found all the apps I needed: alarm.com, Wemo switch, nissan leaf, Audible and other random apps, whose existence kind of surprised me. If I broke this or lost it, I would buy another one in a heartbeat. For me, it really is the price. I'm sick and tired of subsidized phones that force you into contracts. If you don't want a contract, you better pay an arm and a leg (unless it's the new Nexus phone).

Great for the technologically impaired and as a backup phone,"Great phone for the price! I bought this to use with my AT&amp;T contract line as a backup phone. I have the Note 3, and lately, it has been acting up on me. Occasionally, when it fails to send my texts, I simply shut it down, take the sim out and pop the sim into my Lumia 521 to use that. It works perfectly!Amazing to me that a device I paid over 500 bucks for a year ago, can be in the same spot in my basement as this Lumia, and yet fail to send texts that the Lumia seemingly has no trouble sending.I should also mention however, that as a smartphone snob so to speak, I would likely never be able to use this device as my primary device for a long period of time. I find it a bit small, lacking in apps, lacking a front facing camera and rear flash. Having said that, to use in a pinch when the Note acts up, it works great. I have also downloaded offline maps and used them to navigate while not even using my sim in the phone itself. Same goes for using this as MP3 player without any sim.I also would like to point out that my grandmother switched to Tmobile and needed a phone, I suggested the Lumia 521(which is this phone but T-mobile branded) and she LOVES it. Her needs are far different than mine in a smartphone, but she finds it much easier to use than her old Android phone.Overall, I recommend this phone for:-An elderly or technologically impaired person who will likely find it very easy to use-As a backup phone in case your main AT&amp;T phone meets an early demise-As an MP3 player or offline GPS.",2014年11月25日 在美国审核
Cheap Smart Phone.,"I consider myself a tech-geek.

I've been a fan of Apple in the past, I currently use a Moto-X phone partially because my work environment is Google-based. But when it came to picking a phone for my teen, why this one?1. Cheap Smart Phone ... $502. Nokia - Nokia makes REALLY solid phones. I've had the Lumia 900 and my wife the 1020. They are built like beautiful tanks and the 520 is right up there.3. Features - when you buy a cheap SmartPhone, you don't expect nice features - but this phone offers a decent camera, a STORAGE memory card slot, and Cortana(?!?!?!?!).

Best smartphone for the price &amp; great for people upgrading from feature phones!,"It costs as much as a feature phone and is worth so much more!I was looking for an uncomplicated smartphone for my parents who seem to be all satisfied with a feature phone. I wanted to get them something that they can easily catch-up and be as simple as possible. Ofcourse, iPhone will probably fit that requirement better but they wont need that many apps and its too expensive for their type of usage.Before I could recommend this phone to my parents, I decided to get one for myself to try it out. Being a smartphone geek that I am, guess I needed a reason to try another phone anyway :)Here is what I feel about the Lumia 520 and a little bit on the Windows Phone OS itself without going into their detailed technical specs:Fit and finish: It is a well made phone and something that I'd like to hold it in my hands.Touchscreen: I found it to be responsive and didnt miss my touch inputs any time.Ease of use: This comment applies more to the Windows Phone OS rather than this Lumia phone. If you are really looking for a smartphone with a simple operation, this is what it is. There are no multitude of ""screens"" with apps on all those screens. All apps are on a single page that scrolls vertically. If you dont have hundreds of apps, this is a really good user interface.Availability of apps: Again, a Windows OS related comment: There is no doubt that iphones and android phones have the best availability of apps. Microsoft is catching up and I find that if not the very same app, I have always found other apps that has met my need.Tiles: I like that I can resize the size of the apps and that they can display some information on them even before opening them. I also like this feature so I can resize the tiles in a different way and change how my phone looks! Its like having a different face anytime I feel like it! Its like not getting bored looking at the same looking screen of the phone.Data transfer: While I like the iPhone in many ways, i find it irritating that I have to use iTunes to transfer files from my PC. And, this is where I find this phone very easy to perform data transfers. I prefer to just connect the phone to the USB port, drag and drop any files I want to transfer and be done with it.Cons:* No front facing camera. I have had little use of the front facing camera, but as it is almost a standard on a smartphone these days, this could be classified as a missing feature.* The keypad (virtual keyboard) could be improved. I dont have big fingers but still I end up pressing the near by keys more frequently than my iPhone. I do also like the way the auto-correction works on my iPhone so much better than this one.* Apps and their access rights: (Windows phone OS) I would like to have the option of choosing what type of access (contacts, photos, GPS, etc.) I would like to provide to a specific app myself. May be, then this phone wouldnt be so simple...but this in my opinion is a very needed feature. If I choose not to let an app have GPS access, it wont even install the app on the phone. I think i am comparing this to an iPhone, but I think this feature should be on all smart phones.* Auto-dimming is not perfect: I can clearly observe the auto-dimming coming into effect and sometimes it does it a little brighter or dull. Nothing unusable, but could have been better.Before you get all worked up on the cons, note that these are minor ones and remember this is not a high-end smart phone and you did not pay a whole lot of money to get this one too. I can definitely live with these cons.All in all, I highly recommend this smartphone for the following type of users:* You dont need a high-end smartphone* You dont want to spend a whole lot on a smartphone* You are upgrading from a feature phone and want to take it slowly* You wont be using hundreds of apps* You dont need this phone for video chattingNote: I use an iPhone for regular use and this is my backup phone that always stays in my backpack. I use a phone cover that has kept this phone very safe in my backpack for many months now. You may want to read my other review on the phone cover.",2014年5月15日 在美国审核

Great Phone Great Price,"I have had every brand phone operating system over the last 20 years and while I still use my iPhone, I really like my the Windows Phones.

When you compare the cost of an iPhone to the Lumia 520, then will see what a great product this is.Just of couple of things I don't like: The shape of the phone is a wedge, the sides are angled toward the back. I just don't find it comfortable to handle without a case, ofcourse I bought one right away.The other issue is the susceptibility for the screen to get smudged with fingerprints.

Horrible phone that glitches and freezes all the time!,I bought three of these phone and I have to say these were some of the worst phones I ever had. My husbands phone broke within a month. Then my son's and my phone kept freezing all the time. Sometimes it wouldn't dial out or receive calls. Apps would open on there own then wouldn't close until I took the battery out. It always needed to update.There is very little memory on these phones so when you start to download apps or add photos your phone is going to start acting up. Because this is a Windows phone I had to downloada virus protection app which took up memory and seem to made the issues worst. I uninstalled the app but that made the issue worst. The phone always over heated even when it wasn't being used. Just a bad phone all together.I would not ever recommend this phone.

"Not atrocious, but by no means great.","At the time of writing this review, I have owned 2 Nokia Lumia 520s.I purchased this phone after I accidentally broke my galaxy S4. I knew my upgrade wouldn't come up for about a year, and I needed a phone to last me until then. This phone was $50, and a smartphone, so I went ahead and bought it. Then (entirely my own fault) I broke it, and chose to buy another one.It has all of your standard smartphone capabilities: it can text, browse the internet, get apps etc.The biggest complaint I see of Windows Phones is that there are not enough of the ""popular"" apps. I find that most of the apps I use (snapchat, tinder, instagram, facebook, etc), have ports for the winphone. These ports however tend to be pretty terrible. For instance, there is an app called 6snap which allows you to use Snapchat. It's slow, unresponsive, and crashes frequently. However this is better than no app.Other negatives of this phone include the fact that it's abysmally slow compared to other smartphones. It can multi-task, but when it does, it slows down to the point where it's a turtle.Overall I would recommend doing your absolute best to buy a phone for ~100 bucks that is better than this. In fact, try to find an older version of a top end smartphone (for instance find the Galaxy S3, or one of the older G Nexus models). They will serve you better than this phone.However, if $50 is all you have... I guess it isn't terrible..",2014年12月10日 在美国审核
Best phone I've ever had!!!,"I'm a pay-as-you-go kind of girl, so I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a fancy phone with tons of bells and whistles. The past two cheap-o go phones I've used were incredibly wonky and unreliable. Seriously, I've picked some lemons. When I ordered this one, I wasn't expecting too much. Boy was I surprised when I discovered that this gadget is not only user friendly, it's also VERY reliable. No dropped calls. No crappy battery. No strange error code messages. It does what I tell it to do - no problem whatsoever. The windows display really works for me, and I love how I can create my own little collage of apps. The camera works like a charm, and there's a lot of cool built-in photo editing apps that are a lot of fun to tinker around with.I LOVE, LOVE this phone!

Super Sleek and Sexy Phone!,"I finally upgraded from my 2004 Cingular flip phone into the 21st Century with this sleek and stylish Nokia Lumia 520.Quite a nice feel to it's slim design.It has easy to see 'tiles' in 3 sizes, the 'keyboard' is easy to text/type and navigation throughout is pretty easy.Some of the text, like in the address book or on the tiles (glad they use icons or photos) is small for my old eyes so I have to carry reading glasses along with the phone - or until I know where the 'buttons' are and what to push so I can do it blurry.Ha!It took me a little getting used to where to hold it (put my fingers) so I don't hit the back button or turn to sleep mode (the off button on the side) or get the camera when I'm trying to text.That's all just a logistics thing for my hand to figure out.Within a few days, it has now gotten easier.I enjoy all the features and, for the price (""Today's Deal"" was $40) I recommend this phone.",2014年8月27日 在美国审核
Outstanding for the money,"Outstanding smart phone for the price. It does everything - telephone, records/plays HD video and photos, plays music, FM radio, internet browsing, music streaming, wifi, 3/4G cellular, GPS location and voice directions, maps, seamlessly syncs with Mac/iTunes, email, etc. What more do you need and why pay $500 for an iPhone when this is only $30?As a music player, this rivals the expensive iPod Touch. Get a 64gb MicroSD card here at Amazon for $30 and you're all set. Since I listen to classical music, I found the best sounding near-audiophile format is AAC (superior to MP3) which is supported by both Apple and Nokia (Microsoft). The unit's D/A converter is top notch.The only negatives so far are:1) FM radio reception is mediocre to poor. I wish they used a better quality tuner.2) Plastic sealed packaging is horrendous.

"Wow, excellent phone!","This is an excellent phone.I'm not sure what else to say about it.I've used prepaid phones all my life because I don't use a cellphone enough to pay month to month.I'm on AT&amp;T's $25/3 month plan with no data.When I'm out and about, I have no use for data but do use the phone quite a bit on wifi when I'm at home.I love the tile setup on the phone and the ability to change colors of the tiles.You can rearrange however you want (the tiles can do 3 different sizes).There's also an app that you can install so that allows you to group apps together in folders.You can use your own wallpaper for the lock screen.Apparently there's a way to shuffle between favorited pictures but I've not figured that out yet.I was in between this phone and the Moto G.The Moto G doesn't have expandable memory but the Lumia 520 does.I purchased a 32 Gig card to expand and the phone has 8 Gigs of internal (which comes down to around 6 accounting for the OS itself).I still have a ton of space and will likely never use it all.The Nokia Radio is my favorite app that comes preinstalled on the phone.Having a mix of offline music works great for me.The sound that comes from this when playing music is excellent...I didn't expect it to get very loud but it's perfect.You can go up to 30 but I usually have it set around 15ish (I listen to it when I go to bed) and it's more than enough for me.The picture quality is great as well.If you zoom in on something, it gets blurry but I'm not taking pictures of anything that I can't just get up close to take pics of so it works well for me.As far as apps go, there's a lot of good apps for windows phone.Not nearly as many as android or iOS but there's a lot!I had an unlocked iPhone 3GS before this and the battery was only staying charged for a couple of hours so it was time to replace it.I'm glad it was and happy I chose the Lumia 520.I'm happier with this phone than I was my iPhone.The only one complaint I have (it's not about the phone) is the cases.I ordered a case for the phone that said it was compatible with the 520/521.Do NOT order a case that says it's compatible with both.The case I purchased was compatible with the 521, not the 520.The 521 is a tad bit bigger and the case isn't as snug on the 521.Other than that, no complaints.The Lumia 520 also dominates the windows phone world...that's got to mean something, right?",2014年2月5日 在美国审核
Great little GPS and media player.,This is a great little phone for a stand alone GPS unit and a media player.It is also super compact!It's snappy and doesn't lag as much which I was surprised about.DO NOT ACTIVATE THE PHONE.I didn't even insert the supplied SIM card.GPS - free stand alone GPS using the Nokia HERE Maps.You just need to download the maps and voice (if you want it) over wifi BEFORE you leave.It is only licensed for ONE country!It also doesn't pick the best route for a cross country trip but it is great getting around town.Using the GPS doesn't suck the battery life like it does on other phones which is why I got this phone.Media Player - I dropped in a cheap 64 gig media card and put my music and transferred some movies on it.Works great.I got this for $20 shipped so I have no complaints.It works better than my older phones for GPS.,2015年1月4日 在美国审核
Great Deal and Enjoyable Phone Service,"Great first smart phone. I bought this phone on sale at Amazon during Thanksgiving and upgraded to Windows Phone 8.1.Refused Data Plan to use Wifi at home only. Purchased $99.00 for whole year GoPhone Services provided by AT&amp;T at $0.10 per minute. Purchased 1000 Texting Messages for ONLY $9.99 which is deducted from total balance $99.00.So, I have a whole year long Prepaid GoPhone Services provided by AT&amp;T with Talk for 10 cents per minute and Text Messages for ONLY 1 cent each.Moreover, I paid 12-Month Skype Subscription for ONLY $15.00 from Newegg.com during Cyber Week. So, if I talk too much, I use Unlimited Call Service provided by Skype. On the go, I use 10 cents per minute talk provided by AT&amp;T.The phone works pretty smooth. For battery life (which most users complain about), we should go to Battery Saver, tap on Usage and disable Apps running in the background in order to prolong Battery Life.",2014年12月24日 在美国审核
Basic Smartphone,"If you need a phone for texting, internet, email, and facebook (social media apps) the Nokia 520 is more than adequate. Windows phone 8 is fine as long as you not an app-aholic. I purchased this phone to replace a defective Samsung android phone and just put in my current contract sim card (AT&amp;T) and everything works fine. I will say that there are 2 important limitations. First, there is no flash for the camera. Not really a big deal unless you really dig taking lots of photos with your phone or want to use it as a flash light. The second limitation is with playing music on WP8. It is absolutely stupid how difficult it is to make a playlist on this OS. If you want to make a custom playlist, you basically have to do it by connecting to your pc. Hello Microsoft??? This really needs to get fixed. As far as the hardware goes, the phone seems well made for the money and I have no complaints with Nokia.Bottom line...if you can live without a flash for the camera and the pain in the a** it is to make a music playlist, then this phone is a good value.",2014年1月28日 在美国审核

The remaining apps require minimum 1GB RAM and are mostly very high end games.The camera is not great but it is fine for casual photos.

love this phone,"i really like the windows 8 aspect of this phone. The tiles are cool and colorful.I found alot of apps, though there should be more popular apps.The thing I dont like about it is the calendar that comes with it. The print is so small cant read it in the month view, I have been unable to find another app for a calendar that is exactly what I want. i am currently running 3 different appointment calendar apps to see which one I will settle on.Alot of them will not let u edit or delete an appointment, u have to go into hotmail or google. I would prefer to have a stand alone calendar just for my phone that is easy to read, edit or delete. Other than that the phone is fun to use. battery life is ok, depending on what your doing, I usually charge every other day or if doing alot ofof web surfing or texting will charge nightly.

More features &amp; performance than expected from such a low-priced phone,"This phone is one of Nokia's lower-end models, but a quick look at the reviews from cellphone/gadget websites will show that the Nokia Lumia 520 is a capable smartphone that performs well. The camera doesn't have a flash but good pictures are possible if the light is adequate. The photo editing software that comes installed will correct a multitude of photographic mistakes, and the 520 can be configured to automatically upload photos to Microsoft SkyDrive (now renamed to OneDrive). The Map application works well and almost always finds my location quickly; the navigation app is just so-so.There is a hard shell back that pops off easily (sometimes too easily if the phone suffers even a minor fall). Underneath the back is access to the phone's battery, SIM card, and a slot for a micro SDHC card.All-in-all I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of this low-end phone, but there are a few negatives:1)It's a Windows phone; don't expect to find many apps for this platform. Facebook and Twitter have apps for the Windows platform, but many remotely operated gadgets such as the Belkin Wemo don't.2)Packaging: the phone is encased in a thick plastic tub that must be cut open with a good deal of effort. This isn't the fault of Amazon (the Lumia 520 is packaged in plastic by AT&amp;T) but I needed a stiff, very sharp knife to get the 520 free of it's container.3)The price: About a week after I bought this phone from Amazon I saw that a local big-box retailer had the Lumia 520 for $10 less than the Amazon price. I just took it for granted that Amazon always had the lowest price.",2014年1月28日 在美国审核
Great (so far),"This phone replaced my Samsung Focus (very crappy phone). So far the Lumia 520 has been exceeding my every expectation. People complain about the camera, as low end as it may be, it take great pics. It doesn't have a flash so you cannot take low-light pics, but the phone is only $60! You do have to be still as the pics will blur a lot easier, but again, the phone is only $60. The only negatives that I can come up with (right now) are these 2: 1 - no flash means no flashlight. 2- it uses a micro-sim card so I had to switch my old sim over (no problems there, ATT was very friendly and helpful in this manner). This could be a problem though as if this phone dies, I can't just put the sim in one of my old phones and use it. To fix this problem, I will just get another Lumia 520 as a back-up. After all, this phone is only $60. Two of them are still cheaper than most other phones. If any problem develop, I will update this review.",2014年1月23日 在美国审核
This phone might be fine for previous Windows Phone users,"Avoid if you are used to iOS or Android. This phone might be fine for previous Windows Phone users, but coming form a Phone with huge selection of apps and phone features you will be disappointed.

Cheap, works fine with Cricket without having to unlock, as long as you don't upgrade to Windows Phone 8.1 and stay at 8.0 you can teather with it.I purchased this while my iPhone was in the shop just to see Windows Phone in action, I never missed something so much (ie my iPhone) this thing was to crippled for my liking.

Excellent affordable phone,"This is a great CHEAP phone. I emphasize the word cheap because this is not a flagship device, it's simply a great alternate phone to be used as a backup or maybe someones first smartphone. With the upgrade to Windows Phone 8.1 and the addition of Cortana, it has really made the functionality of this device even more promising. The call quality is in many cases better than many flagship Android devices. I particularity like the quick connectivity of it's bluetooth and wifi radios.I purchased this device as a temporary replacement for my quickly dying HTC One X+, I didn't want to purchase a new Android phone until after MWC and all the new models are released. I will admit I won't stay with Windows Phone OS but it has been a pleasant surprise. It could be a real contender in the near future with Win 10 for phones coming soon.",2015年1月30日 在美国审核
Excellent low-end winmo device,"Bought this one as a test device for some Win8 programming, and it has lived up to the expectations so far. For the price it is a bargain - I have no qualms that I am not really going to use it as a phone, but I use it for a number of minor things at home in addition to the app testing. Updating to Win8.1 was a bit of a challenge - the update kept failing after downloading, but using the Lumia updater tool it was simple to update. Hopefully Winmo 10 will work on this. Looking forward to it.The device itself is fairly low end - but for most practical purposes it works great - screen is snappy and responsive, low resolution but still pictures and videos play well. I wouldn't try too many intensive graphical games on this - most games I tried were choppy at best. Otherwise its a nice daily driver for those who want a cheap AT&amp;T phone.",2015年2月8日 在美国审核
Perfect backup phone,"Can you really write complaints about a $50 phone? I bought this phone primarily as a backup phone for work purposes. If you're looking for a good, low cost, no-contract phone, then this one is tough to beat. It can't compete with the higher end phones, but it should not be expected to at its far lower price point. It offers decent call quality, although the volume doesn't get quite as loud as I'd like. The display screen is also decent, as is the camera. However, there is no flash and no front facing camera. Not really a surprise at this price. Basically, the first sentence of my review sums it up pretty well. If you want an inexpensive no-contract phone that gives you good bang for your buck, I believe you'll be very happy with this phone. If you want higher end features, you'll need to spend significantly more money. Overall I am quite happy with this phone.",2014年9月21日 在美国审核
The phone seems very nice and excellent for the price,"The phone seems very nice and excellent for the price, however this is the first smart phone I owned and so I made some basic errors in purchasing it. I have a TracFone account and thought I could use it with that because they use AT&amp;T as a provider in my area. Unfortunately, I did not know that they were two types of phones; CDMA and GSM. This is GSM and TracFone requires CDMA. However, I read in the questions that users had submitted, that after 90 days AT&amp;T will unlock it. I assumed that this meant that after 90 days I could get it unlocked and look for an inexpensive carrier that uses GSM phones. Unfortunately, I found out that AT&amp;T will only unlock it if you have been a customer, which means you have had to had one of their plans for 90 days. Obviously, the cost of doing that far outweighs the cost of the phone.None of this is to say the phone is useless. it will connect to the Internet at any Wi-Fi hotspot. It will also do all the things a smart phone can do off-line and will hold up to a 64 MB microSD card. Since I didn't intend to get a data plan anyway, it will perform all the functions I expected of it except be a telephone, so it is still well worth the price.",2014年9月4日 在美国审核
1st time windows phone user,"Here is my review of the Nokia Lumia 520This is a Windows Phone(my first) and I have to say I am quite enjoying it.The Dedicated camera button is something I was wishing for on my previous Android phone and it came with a 5 megapixel camera. The only thing I feel it is lacking in the camera department is flash, but for less than $100 I'm not going to complain.The Windows Phone OS has taken a bit of getting used to after moving from Android however after a few days I was comfortable with it. One thing I was worried about was available quality apps. I am happy to say that I have found it to be very well supplied. Iam not a phone power user that is always trying new apps for this or that but every time i have wanted something I have been able to find it and in some cases it was already on the phone.I have found one thing I don't like about the OS and that is the lack of customization out of the box.

Great phone!!!,"This phone is AMAZING.I absolutely love it, i have used Iphones, Androids... but this is my first Windows phone and i prefer it over the Iphone, and most of the androids I've used (around its price).There isnt as many apps as Android or iOS, but there still is alot of apps *(EVEN Junowallet!!!)*I'm really enjoying this phone, can't wait to see what new apps will come to it in the future!The camera is pretty good as well, make sure to use the ""Smart shoot"" app (pre-installed) for the best quality picture (ill post a picture taken from that app)The phone doesnt have as customization as iphones and androids, but its still at only version 8.1, I'm sure more customizing features will be available around 8.5.Basically all you can do is change the background COLOR (black or white) and changes the colors of tiles. there are some apps to improve the customization, but not by much.

"solid 3 star performance, 4 star value...","I needed an additional Ipod like device and found the Nokia 520 on sale, bought it, searched twitter for info/experiences on it the next morning and saw it went on crazy sale, canceled original and bought for $20 less. So because I have so little invested into it compared to my old Ipod touch I think it's great for most my purposes.Plus side: decent GPS navigation (pretty up to date POI) but touchy when searching for exact names (H-E-B not HEB; that sort of thing), has micro SD slot for Music/Photos so you get as much of the 8GB to put on apps, pictures look pretty good considering no flash (nice multi shot modes in the Nokia software that allows you to choose a shot to keep).Weird side: I don't get the Windows app store's vendors-seems like they are all guys that are creating site launchers (walmart for example) so Windows phones don't seem very supported by the normal vendors (won't have your local banks app), the vertical tiles orientation is annoying (find my self moving apps around to group them in bundles of similar apps on the long scroll down page like going back to some sort of ""links I like"" list from 1997, can't use as a wifi adapter for a PC at home that doesn't have wifi, The cloud backup doesn't give me much confidence (be nice if there was a Nokia suite for back ups, personalizing, organizing apps etc for a wide range of operating systems).Since all I wanted was the GPS, expandable memory for music, and some web browsing its great for the price. If I was going to have to deal with the Nokia 520 as a smartphone I was more attached to I'd go with a cheap used Android to get more common apps and wifi tethering. Maybe if you have windows 8 on a computer to sync with it's a better experience.",2014年1月29日 在美国审核

great phone for the price,"For $70 this phone surpassed my expectations. So the windows market isn't as vast as android or apple.

It is loud and produces great sound quality but its so small that if you cover it with your pinky you wouldn't be able to hear it, even on the loudest setting. I carry a digital camera on me so I don't mind the low megapixels and lack of front facing camera. I love how everything is streamlined and the live tiles are really cool.

Surprisingly great phone at an amazing price.,"I've been using an HTC One X at&amp;t for a year and a half now and after the screen stopped working for the second time I didn't feel like replacing it again. I bought this because of the amazing price point, the expandable memory, and because it accepts at&amp;t sim cards.Going from a flagship phone to something meant to be a burner is obviously a noticeable difference, but it hasn't bothered me at all.First I'll address the elephant in the room, Its a Windows phone. While the windows marketplace isn't on par with Google play or the app store, its getting there. I'm a pretty generic smartphone user and it fits my needs just fine. I use my phone for internet browsing, various social media, notes, mapping, and texting/calling. It very easily does all these things and I haven't found it lacking at all in any of the apps i need. the few pre-loaded Nokia/Windows/At&amp;t can be deleted but there are actually some great apps that come on it.I didn't know what to do for music on a windows phone but there is a combined music app that can plays from all sources of audio on the phone (Pandora, Xbox music, downloaded music, rhapsody, ect.) and Nokia has made it easy to move downloaded music from your computer onto your phone, but if you don't use Xbox music its difficult to legally download music and make playlists on the phone, you have to do that on your computer.Here Maps- I've never strayed from Google maps before, but I find myself liking Here maps. It has an easy to use interface, great directions, and best of all completely free downloadable maps. What this means is you can have all your maps information stored on your phone so you can get directions without using any data, and it doesn't even take up that much storage! (around 200 mb's for my entire state)The screen doesn't have to massive pixel density of today's smart phones but it isn't lacking at all. Text it sharp and images/video look great and i cant see individual pixels unless i look closely. Also the speaker is surprisingly loud and not distorted.I was skeptical of the battery life due to the small capacity (1430mah) but it has been surprisingly great. The phone is efficient enough to where the battery can last more than a day if i needed it too but i still charge every night, and it charges fast too. Because of the easily removable back cover you can also buy extra batteries (less that 5$) and exchange them out.The camera is probably the phone's biggest downfall. There is only a rear facing camera and its a not very powerful 5 megapixels. One of the larger inconveniences is not having a camera flash. I found myself using it as a flashlight a lot on my last phone and i do notice not having it on this one. The one only other annoying thing i noticed is that the audio output jack is set a little deep into the phone so you may have to remove your case to use it.After a month, the phone has held up great, and I've had virtually no issues. I have never run into a lack of ram available and after expanding the memory via a micro SD card (ridiculously easy to do) i can store all my music, and maps easily on my phone. Its amazing they can make a phone with a gps, 4G, expandable memory, Bluetooth, and real smartphone capabilities for less than 60$.",2014年8月8日 在美国审核

Incredible Windows 8.1 phone at an unbelievable price for what you get!,"Incredible, especially for the price.Would likely give this 5 stars at a price closer to $200 (maybe 4 at $200).I'm not gonna list everything, but with all the new Windows Phone 8.1 features, this thing can't be beat for twice the price (even when shopping pre-owned).Even if you have a good phone, this is a worthy backup, and if you don't, unless you want to spend a lot of money, this is the phone to get.Some quick highlight of Windows Phone [8.1]:Live tiles are much better than even iPhones current UI, and any android launcher.Quick Notifications (swipe from the top), has customize-able quick toggles and previews of new messages and emails.Cortana voice commands (not too shabby)Swipe to type keyboard (definitely nice, especially helpful on the smaller screen)All your standard phone features... including some you don't see on much more expensive phones.Visual voice mail, call/text blocking by number (AT&amp;T charges a ton to use their service if your phone doesn't do it like this one does), internet sharing (private WiFi network supports 8 devices at once)... and lots more.Nokia specific feature:Nokia Mix radio (Lets you create custom radio stations with no visual or audio advertisements.AND the free account still lets you make 4 stations offline, downloading something like 2 dozen songs each, and can be refreshed at anytime for new songs)Nokia Maps and Drive+ (Let's you download maps so you can use them without service, whether you are on the subway, in the middle of no where, or too cheap to pay for data.Includes turn by turn navigation, as well as course mapping for public transit, walking, or driving)Great camera software (the camera is not half bad for the price.Just no flash, and no front facing)As with all Nokia phones, this thing is very durable (did not really expect that).Has a MicroSD expansion slot (can expand with up to 64gb.Most expensive phones even omit this.)Decent battery life, especially with battery saver on.The size is actually great, I find myself enjoying the fact that it's so small, not too concerned about the screen not being huge.Doesn't come jam packed with software you don't want (I may have uninstalled 3-4 apps, which took seconds to do).The whole Windows Phone interface seems well thought out and simple to adapt to.Everything is pretty much where I expect it to, and easy to get to.The user experience is incredible for the specs (I've had quad core phones seemingly feel less responsive... I don;t know how)Of course there's a few cons.But this is only when comparing to top of the line 5-700 phones.The screen seems to be a magnet for finger prints (makes it a little harder to see in direct sun light, but wipe it off, and its still usable in the sun.No front facing camera (I never video chat, but would have been nice, would have made this phone have pretty much every feature you could ask for if it did).No flash (camera still works fine, but I do like having a flash to double as a flashlight when in a pinch)As far as standard phone features go, this has pretty much all of them, and they all work great.Call quality, even speakerphone, is great.You should buy this whether you need a phone or not.And at $60 (well $40 today!) you can't go wrong.You can also never activate this phone, and it'll be a great GPS, mp3 or streaming music player, and then some.",2014年8月14日 在美国审核
"Need to know info for ""post-paid"" (AKA contract) plans and this phone","First off, I really like this phone.There is one semi-major flaw in its design - the power button is located on the side of the phone.This makes the phone turn off in my pocket from time to time, which is annoying (and why I gave this phone four stars), but I'm ordering a belt-case, so in the end, it's not a big deal for me.In addition, the price on this is great, so I'm not going to complain too much.********UPDATE: I discovered that it was not the power button being located on the side of the phone that was causing it to turn off.Instead, the battery was a little loose, and if pressure was put on the phone in just the right way (apparently my pants pockets knew just what to do), the battery would lose contact and the phone would turn off.EASY FIX - just cut a piece off of an index card, folded it a few times and wedged it between the battery and the case to ensure the battery had a tight fit.Problem solved, phone hasn't cut off since.********Now, down to what a lot of you need to know: does/how does this phone work with a post-paid or contract plan?The following information comes from dealing with AT&amp;T customer service (which was incredibly helpful throughout this process).First of all, you can use this phone with a contract or post-paid plan.At least they didn't stop me.Second, AT&amp;T **WILL** eventually add a data plan to your contract.Their customer service rep told me that their system is designed to recognize smart phones and will automatically add a data plan to your line at some point.A data plan IS REQUIRED for any smartphone on AT&amp;T's network, so eventually, they will get to you.Third, you HAVE TO HAVE A DATA PLAN in order to send and receive picture or video messages with this phone.If you are having trouble sending or receiving picture or video messages, go to settings --&gt; cellular --&gt;turn data on.But here is the good news.AT&amp;T recently released a new plan, called the Mobile Share Plan, which gives you unlimited talk, text, and a set amount of data to share between up to 10 devices.You can find this plan on their website, but I will say that it SAVED ME MONEY compared to my old ""family-share"" plan and I went from having around 700 minutes a month to UNLIMITED.So, needless to say, it was a win-win for my family.The real kicker of upgrading to the Mobile Share Plan is that IT DOES **NOT** REQUIRE A NEW CONTRACT - which is important for me, as my family was all out of contract.If you upgrade a phone through AT&amp;T, you will have to enter a 2-year agreement in order to get the discounted price on the phone, but if you are already out of contract, you can switch to this new plan without entering a new agreement.Finally, the amount of data is variable with the Mobile Share Plan, but it is SHARED, so you don't have to buy multiple data plans.We went with the smallest amount (300 mb) to save money and because we plan on using mostly Wi-fi with this phone.Also, as an aside - this phone takes a micro-sim card.If you have a contract plan, you will have to pick one of these up from your local AT&amp;T store.You can have them activate it at the store, but this requires the phone's IMEI number (located under the battery).I wasn't sure if there would be an issue since this is a ""go phone,"" so I decided to call AT&amp;T's customer service line to activate my new sim card instead.I bought this phone because I wanted to use the smartphone features on wi-fi, not realizing that I would be required to get a data plan.Thankfully, I ended up saving money in the end and getting unlimited talk in the process.Win.",2014年1月29日 在美国审核
"Nice phone, great price.","What a great little phone. I use a Nexus 5, but sometimes don't like to bring that along on vacation, or other outings. I found this on lightning deal the other day for $50 and gave it a shot. I heard how much some people like windows phones and wanted to try it out anyway so it was a good opportunity. I am less than impressed with the software and apps, but the phone itself is much nicer than I thought, it's a little fat, but the screen is actually very nice for a lower resolution, and I can't see any pixilation. the colors on the screen are bright and vibrant. I haven't yet made a call yet, because I am too lazy to move my SIM, but I am now all set up and ready with the apps and settings. It is certainly different than Android, and there is no way I could switch to Windows with the lack of apps and settings, but luckily I don't need much in a spare phone.",2014年7月12日 在美国审核
Excellent value,"For a first smart phone, it's a great value. I was attracted by Microsoft's Cortana in Win 8.1 to see how a Siri-like voice recognition system would work, a test drive more or less. If it didn't work for my purposes, the sunk cost was pretty minimal, less than 5% of what the iBrand would cost. I can see now that the processor is rather slow as it takes a while for the tile screen to come up. But even if it gets replaced with a faster phone in a year or so, I'll still have a back-up phone as well as a music player, cheap camera, etc.I am also encouraged by the money MS seems to be putting into a unified OS (Win 10) across all devices/platforms. Hopefully this will encourage app development, since that is one of the primary drawbacks of this phone, the lack of some popular apps.",2015年1月25日 在美国审核
Large Screen &amp; Works on Home Wi-Fi,"I got this phone because I wanted to download a few educational programs or videos a month using my home Wi-Fi instead of getting a cell plan with Wi-Fi &amp; it works great for that. (I actually have had texting &amp; internet purposely blocked on my cell plan).I wish the micro SD card wasn't so hard to get to, but you have the plug in connection to the computer to transfer, so that works instead. I also am not used to a phone that doesn't charge completely shut down since when I charge them they are left plugged in overnight past the full charge.So far I've had no problems with that situation. It is a simple phone to use with almost too many paths to get to the same place in all cases.

I thought this was a great intro to Windows Phone 8/8,"I thought this was a great intro to Windows Phone 8/8.1.I got it just before 8.1 came out as a test run moving from my iPhone 4 which had hit 3 years old and was so sluggish it was practically unusable.I'd really wanted to try out Windows Phone since 8 came out but was afraid to make the leap with a contract so this was a good compromise.I think it was 50 when I got it.It didn't have a flash or some of the fancier features, but it served the purpose of giving me a taste of Windows Phone 8 and I fell in love.I used it for a month and then upgraded to my Lumia 1520.I continued to use this one to fiddle with and I had it in the dev preview just to see how it would perform on the later versions, which it did well.I eventually gave it to my mother in law when her Lumia 900 screen shattered and she has enjoyed it thus far.",2015年2月28日 在美国审核

It has well surpassed my expectations and its performance is outstanding when you take into account its price. I was using an iPhone 4s prior to this and although I miss the apps of the iPhone, (apps on windows are still few and far between )the essential apps are starting to be available. A couple of areas that I must call out where I found this superior to the iPhone are the texting -once you start a conversation the auto prompt is incredibly good and I can frequently complete my sentences without having to type anything more than the first word! The maps too are excellent as is the driving map assist. I dont play games on my phone so there is not a lot that I miss there but it does not have compass sensor so one cannot download a compass app on this.Other apps too may not work as well as on the iPhone. For instance dictionary.com app installs but doesnt seem to work.

It heats up if you talk on it for hours, but I don't like long conversations on the phone anyways, I would rather meet up and talk if I need to talk that long. I downloaded the offline map on my sister's phone but so far didn't need to use it offline. We both love the camera button, we never use the tap on screen function when taking pictures. Camera is not the best, but good enough. Battery charges up very quickly too. And I never see her bring a charger with her, which means the battery last for quiet a while too.

So sad.,"I've had this phone for about 6 months and at first it was working perfectly...I love how you can customize your screen and it does what its suppose to do...when it wants to. If I would have written a review for this phone when I first gotten it, I would have given it 5 stars...as it is, it's half a year later and now, the on button works 85% of the time. I have mine set for double tapping the screen to turn it on as well...and even that works 65% of the time. There have been plenty time where I have tried to turn it on, and it won't...the internet won't work on it anymore...even though I checked the settings and it's on...it really isn't.

Good budget phone.,"Not bad, but it's starting to get buggy after about a year. Mainly the trouble is with cortana making calls to my wife in care mode, or anyone else for that matter. It also stops working sometimes and I have to reboot it. My wife has a 1020 and I had to take it apart to reboot it. If you are on a budget, I'd recommend these and consumer cellular for service. You'll need a micro sim from them, and they sell them so don't worry. ATT does as well if you want to stay with them.Apps are getting better for windows phones and the OS is really very cool and handy. Don't be discouraged by my rating, it's not a bad phone but it does not deserve too many stars. Nokia is just a basic phone, and always will be; that's not necessarily a bad thing. I do recommend this phone if you are on a budget.",2015年3月13日 在美国审核
My first smart phone,"overall i like it; its my first smart phone so i really cant compare it to others.It has alot of personal customization available to it which seems nicer than my wifes Iphone.The only flaw i found was that you can't set text notifications to be only vibrate and still have a sound ringer for calls. It has to be sound and vibrate, vibrate for all, or nothing. This is the reason for the 4 stars. Seems like a major thing to overlook.Even my old school phone was capable of setting texts to be vibrate.5/3/15 UPDATE: I dont know if they changed something in an update but lately this phone will not hold a charge longer than half the day.I bought a new battery thinking that the battery had gone out (after only three months of owning this), but this problem still occurs.

All things considered, he seems to love it--something you might not necessarily expect with a twenty dolalr phone.The only reason I subtracted a star is Windows phones obviously have some limitations when it comes to the availability of their apps.

We are on the AT&amp;T go phone plan, and I couldn't afford to pay $700 for a phone. I found this and for the price I figured I would try it. I love this phone! Now, you have to keep in mind that this is an inexpensive phone, so it's not going to compare to say, the Galaxy S5.

The battery life is excellent, I can use it all day and still have battery left when I go to bed. The only con I have found is that the camera isn't that great. There is no front facing camera, which isn't a big thing for me, I don't video call a lot and I have my iPad for that. The back camera is a little disappointing.

Fantastic Phone!,"This phone was my first Windows Phone.I bought it to use on Airvoice Wireless.Pros:I really like the home screen's display.The tiles are very convenient, and you can move them around are re-size them.Wifi works well.It seems to have pretty good data speed rates, and I have no problem streaming music.The Windows App Store actually has a lot of great free offerings.You can get most of the popular apps (Facebook, Twitter, iHeartRadio, TuneIn Radio, texting apps, Instagram through 3rd party apps), and there are many more to explore.I'm pretty impressed with the camera.For 5MP, the quality is very good.The video comes out great as well.It's solid in low-light settings as well, but it doesn't have a flash.The ""people app"" that sort of functions as your address book takes some time to learn.It can import all of your contacts from your email and Facebook (and maybe other social networks).It pulls in email addresses, phone numbers, and whatever else it can find (employer, birthday).Cons:I wish the speakerphone was a little louder.The battery lasts about a day.On days when I use the phone a lot, it doesn't quite make it for a full day, but I think that's typical for smartphones.One set back is the lack of Java support.You won't have full functionality on the web browser, but I've learned to deal with this.Some websites won't be able to stream video, and others won't allow you to click on pop-up menus.For the price and the features you get with it, I highly recommend this phone.",2013年10月22日 在美国审核
Even some of the iPhone addicts are starting to question the wisdom of blindly pay top dollar to Apple when this Lumia phone doe,"In spite of all the laughs about using a Windows phone my buddies are now wondering why they spent many many times what I did for a phone. Even some of the iPhone addicts are starting to question the wisdom of blindly pay top dollar to Apple when this Lumia phone does almost as much and it runs Windows stuff just like the computer.The best part was the free update to Win 8.1 right after I got the phone. Just plug it in, start the process and leave it alone for a while and it is done. Windows works for me so this phone was a natural for me. The sound is quite good, in fact I have to remember to turn it down when I go someplace. Finally, I love playing with Cortana. So cool, and it really works.Dan",2014年9月15日 在美国审核
A Great Phone for the Price!,"If you're looking for a great, inexpensive starter phone or just want a basic do everything smart phone, this would be one to really consider. Its got all the bells and whistles of a fun phone without draining your bank account or being tied down with a 2 year contract. If you have ATT, you can pick up this gem for 55.00 here on Amazon. Even if you use another provider, this phone can be bought unlocked for about 80.00 to 100.00. This is still a good price for what this phone does.I went from an Android phone to this Windows 8 phone. I'm still using Win 7 on my PC so there is a learning curve for me,but it isn't hard. If you use Win 8, you're that much more ahead.The camera on this phone is rear facing only, but its 5 mp and takes a great picture! It also has a couple of camera apps that makes it really fun and cool like Panorama and Cinemagraph.The sound is great if you like your music or are using speaker phone. The store has most major apps you might want (Netflix, YouTube, Pandora,IHeart) but still has some limitations if you're comparing it to Google Play.After having this phone for about a month, I am still more than happy with it.Phone is sending me all my notifications, camera still rates well for a 5 mp on a phone, sound is still great, and no more dropped calls compared to my Android phone. Don't get me wrong, I like Android, I just got a bad deal on a particular phone. I would still highly recommend this phone to anyone on a budget. This phone beats other compatibly priced phones (and more expensive phones) hands down.The phone has a 4 inch screen which is compatible to IPhone 5 and has 4 brightness settings which is great for outdoors. I could go on and on.As I said before, this is a great phone for the price! You shouldn't be disappointed.",2014年6月16日 在美国审核

I wish the status bar would remain displayed all the time, but that's a limitation of screen real estate and other apps.I just inserted myexisting SIM card(after cutting it down) into the 520and after the set up she fired right up.Also I am on 4G now instead of 3G, a bonus.",2014年2月12日 在美国审核
"Easy to use, durable- but the battery is going out on it!","I have had this phone for well over a year now. It is a fairly durable phone, I have four kids and it has lived through some pretty hard drops (and occasional throws). The touchscreen is great, and still works perfectly fine after a year. The camera is okay- for a Go phone....I will definitely be getting a better camera though on my next phone- since that is what I tend to use the most. It is a very easy phone to use, and would probably be using for a long time coming- however the battery has recently stopped holding a charge. I believe that it is time to start looking for another phone since I can probably find another one that is just as easy to use with a little better camera.

Social Media Bad - Texting Great!,"I used this for a short while, but I did not like all the plugged-in social media that I could not find out how to get away from.I sold it on Craigslist.The one thing I really liked about this phone that I would really like to see in a basic phone is the texting technology. I could start typing in a message, and the software would give me a list of 4 or 5 different phrases that would be next likely. If I started typing in a letter to my next word, that list of words would immediately be filtered down to a list that matched what I had typed in. I was able to send more complete text messages, rather than the chunky ""WHERE R U?"" texts I generally use.Do any other phones do this?

"Awesome bargain phone; or simply use as a music player/wifi web-surfer/GPS.  For the price, can't go wrong!","For $30, what a great bargain!I have to caveat, however, that I'm only using this as a portable wifi device/MP3 player, not as an actual phone.Thus, my review only covers the functionality of the device except for the phone function, and of course, is my subjective, non-expert opinion.Cosmetically, it is a simple yet elegant design.The back cover (black) has a matte finish that has a nice texture and keeps the device from slipping out of your hands.The smooth back cover is only interrupted by the camera lens, and engraved Nokia logo, speaker hole, and subtle ATT logo.The front is also simple, with only the earpiece speaker and Nokia logo at top (flanked by some sensors, which you cannot really see) and the capacitive touch buttons on the bottom bezel.The glass is smooth, but as one reviewer noted, the surface of the screen has a sort of ""stickiness"" to it.Hard to describe, but it almost feels like extremely fine sandpaper (like 5000 grit or higher).Nothing that's uncomfortable or detracts from the functionality of the screen, and as I've been using it more and more, that ""stickiness"" seems to be gone.One other thing with the screen, where the glass ends to meet the plastic framing of the phone, it is elevated ever so slightly from the glass surface, interrupting what would otherwise be a completely smooth/flush face of the phone. Again, nothing big or uncomfortable, but a completely flush front face would add more class. Overall, this phone has a simple elegance to it that makes it look/feel like a much more expensive phone, and is very comfortable to hold.Physical functionality, this phone works as well as many higher end phones.The screen is vibrant and very responsive to touches/swipes, and despite the sub-HD resolution, everything looks pleasant.For me, texts are easy to read, and images look sharp. I'm sure the smaller size of the screen (4"" diagonal) helps in this regard.The ""soft buttons"" work well and are simple and intuitive.All the physical buttons are on the right side of the phone (if looking at the face of the phone); of note, the volume rocker is at the top, the power button below that, and the camera button (very handy!) is below that.I note this because in my experience, the power button is usually the top most button, with the volume rocker below that.Also, having a physical camera button is something not found on many smartphones, but I find is very handy to have and makes snapping pictures easier.Also, pressing the camera button from the home screen automatically opens the camera, so you don't have to look/find your camera app to activate the camera. The speaker is reasonably loud, and sounds typical of ""any given smartphone.""The camera shoots decent shots on par with many smartphones, but like most smartphone cameras, works best in well lit situations with a stationary subject.Low light shots are only OK to bad at best, and expect moving subjects to be blurry when the picture is taken.Also, there is no flash or front facing camera, so no selfies or video chats like Skype (though oddly, you can download a flashlight app and Skype is pre-loaded).4 out of 5 for this category, with the main detractors being lack of front camera and flash for rear camera, but for the price ($30) this is an outstanding piece of kit.In terms of performance, I am highly impressed particularly because of this price point.Despite only having 512MB RAM (I prefer a minimum of 1GB) and ""only"" a dual core processor, it is extremely fluid in operation.Comparatively speaking, I'd put it slightly above my old Galaxy S2, which was a flagship phone back in it's day.Compared to other equivalent Android phones (like an LG Lucid VS840, which has similar specs) I'd give this phone the win (at least for operation).Out of the box, this came with Windows 8, which I promptly updated via Over the Air update to Windows 8.1.I primarily use Android OS, followed by iOS, and comparatively speaking, my opinion is that Win 8.1 is every bit as good as either OS.The interface is intuitive, and I like the tile setup on the home page.I particularly like how the ""live tiles"" provide updates and realtime information, like widgets do in Android OS.Swipes and transitions are very smooth, better than many Android phones, particularly those that have carrier or manufacturer skins overlaid, like Samsung and transition smoothness is near if not on par with iOS -- actually, the smoothness reminds me much of iOS.Animations occur without lag or stutter.Wifi works great; connected without a problem and have surfed the web and downloaded a few apps already.Speaking of apps, the Microsoft store is still barren compared to iTunes App Store or Google Play.However, the really popular apps all seem to be available.Overall, this phone impresses (at least me) with how smoothly everything runs, particularly because of it's ""lower end"" hardware specs. Honestly, I'd say the user interface experience is as fluid as the most high powered Android phones, and on par with the industry ""standard"", iOS, and as intuitive as either.Overall, this device, for the price, is easily on par with other phones costing much, much more. For those looking for an inexpensive device that works well, is intuitive to use, and meets what most might consider basic functionality, this is a deal that must seriously be considered. Only power hogs, gamers, fanboys, and the selfie addicted would turn their nose to this device.Regular people, however, would find this to be a great device at a bargain.UPDATE: 10 days later...I continue to be amazed with this little device. I'm still only using it as a portable wifi device, but have had an opportunity to use it extensively as a GPS unit as well using the HERE DRIVE+ app that comes loaded on the system. I have to say....it works great, particularly because you can use it offline (i.e. without a wifi or mobile data connection). You have to take some time to download maps up front, and one big gripe is that the maps are stored on the phone's internal memory--at least I haven't been able to move it to the SD card.Thus, you can't download all the maps for all 50 states in the US as it exceeds the total remaining phone storage left.You have to be selective in what maps you download, but that's fine as most won't be travelling through every state all the time.And, as a GPS, this thing works like a charm!Directions have been spot on and timely (no ""Turn Now"" as you're passing the turn), however, if using offline, you can't get real-time traffic updates.But otherwise, this works as well as my dedicated Garmin GPS unit.Also, I have to comment on the versatility of this device as an MP3 player/walkman.First, the MUSIC MIX app that came loaded on the phone. It's a free music streaming app let's you stream via wifi or data, but the real win is that you can also download playlists to listen to offline!It's awesome; certainly a good alternative to streaming music if there's no available wifi and/or if you don't want to burn up your data plan if you've activated the phone. Also, this device has a built in FM radio (needs headphones though, to use as the antenna) which is nice and works great...not even my Nexus 6 has a built in FM tuner.The radio is another way to get music or your favorite station without wifi or burning up your data plan.And because of it's small size, this device is easy to bring along while working out or running.I've also downloaded some games as well. Unfortunately, diversity of games in the Microsoft store is much less than iTunes or Google Play, and even then, some games won't play (or load) because the phone doesn't have enough RAM, storage space, or both, to play.That said, games like Angry Birds Star Wars and Hill Climber play just as well as they do on other devices.I did notice that when playing Angry Birds, the back of the phone got pretty warm.However, all of my Android phones get warm if not hot playing Angry Birds as well.Bottomline is that while this device can play games, don't expect too much out of it.The additional time with this phone has made me like it even more.Seriously, I can't believe this only cost $30!!UPDATE 1 YEAR LATER: Wow, 1 year later and I'm still impressed by this little device.Still only using it as my MP3/wifi device, but I've also used it as a GPS unit as well; the HERE app is so good, I use it now on my Android devices for off-line GPS capability!I've also been using it paired to a set of bluetooth headphones and it's a great combo for working out.Still can't believe I got this for $30 when it does just as well as an iPod Touch costing hundreds more!",2014年12月7日 在美国审核

After a few months of use...,Purchased this phone a few months ago as a replacement for my iphone mostly because of it's price along with being able to avoid needing to re-do a contract just to get a new phone. My iphone was reaching close to 4 yrs old but still seems to outperform this lumia in everyday tasks. I literally once spent 2+hrs trying to navigate amazon's site to place an order of a few products using this phone using both the preinstalled ie browser and the highly reviewed UC browser from their app store. It's hard to explain but simple things like browsing web sites seem to be a chore on this phone compared to my old iphone. Maybe it's just me but I also make many more typing errors when texting on this phone vs the iphone.

Steal for $20,"Being an Android fan, I bought this to explore the world of Windows phones. To be honest, I'm quite impressed with this device.

Affordable Windows Phone,"The Lumia 520 is a entry level smartphone that comes with Windows Phone 8.0 and can be used with pre-paid or post paid plans. This is a good backup phone and it is a good phone for the kids (no Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy Sx). The phone take approximately 40-45 seconds to boot up. Can be used as a Wi-Fi only device or MP3 player. Why would I pay Apple $150 for a 16GB iPod nano? The device uses a micro SIM; so I need a nano SIM to micro SIM adapter. The following applications adds value to the phone: HERE Drive+; HERE Maps; HERE Transit; and Office. Overall, this is a good phone given the specifications and price point.With normal usage, I get through the day with the battery. The battery capacity is 1430 mAh, which is about normal capacity for a phone of this size. One should note it is a higher capacity battery than that on the Nokia Lumia 620, which comes in at 1300 mAh.Pros:- microSD card slot, I currently installed a 64GB microSD card.- you can install Windows Phone 8.1 Preview for Developers; apps can be installed on the memory card if you are running Windows Phone 8.1 Preview for Developers.- display is sensitive.- affordable and it's a no contract phone. If the phone is lost or breaks, it's no biggie.- battery is user swappable.- priced at approximately $55 from amazon.com, which is also cheaper than getting it directly from AT&amp;T.Cons:- 8GB internal memory storage, about 50% of it is usable as the rest is allocated to the operating system.- 512GB RAM which runs most apps, but there could be issues in the future.- no flash for camera, forget about taking pictures after the sun sets or in the dark.- capacitive buttons at the bottom of the phone are not backlit.- does not support LTE, but did you really expect it at this price point?- lacks a front facing camera, so no selfies and no video calls.",2014年7月3日 在美国审核

"A pleasantly speedy phone for an excellent price, what more could you want?","I'll start by saying, I ditched my iPhone 4 (sorry Apple) and opted for this because of the price point ($70 at the time).This phone is sweet, it's about half an inch wider than my old iPhone 4 and just slightly longer. The interface, though tough to get used to at first coming from a 2 year tryst with iPhone, is very pleasant and fluid.The processor has plenty of ""oomph"" and adds to the fluidity of the interface, my key presses register basically without delay and the scrolling happens without lag or jitters.Another cool thing is that, for now anyway, Microsoft will be updating all their phone operating systems very similarly which is nice when coming from Apple where they basically stop all support and updates for their devices relatively quickly when their latest and greatest comes out.I mean, Windows XP still has updates being released (until April 2014, that is) , that's a 12 year old operating system that they are still supporting and it really means a lot. Back on topic, I am pleasantly surprised with the windows mobile layout, and while I don't care to see people's faces on live tiles such as Facebook, I dig the weather and email tile updates.All in all, I don't have any buyer's remorse, I don't miss my iPhone and plan on looking at the Lumia phones in the future.",2013年12月24日 在美国审核

I was just looking for a temporary replacement for my dead iPhone 4s until I was upgrade eligible and in that sense, it fills the roll with ease. But there are a lot of differences between iOS and Windows 8.1 in the phone arena and while this phone works well as a substitute, I won't be using it long term. You definitely want to have the phone check for and install updates right away. It will install one round of updates in about 15-20 minutes and take you back to the start menu. You then repeat the process and this time it will install the 8.1 update which took over an hour. Once that one is installed, you can start using the phone.Pros--It's really an unbeatable value for a full-featured smart phone with no contract.-Changing from an iPhone 4S to this phone is ridiculously easy- you just move the SIM card from the old phone to the new. The Lumia will immediately take over the Cell service and you can make/receive calls right away. The iPhone 4 uses the same SIM card so I would guess it's just as easy. You will have to move photos/contacts/music over manually though.-The screen is better than I expected. I think the iPhone 4S screen is slightly better for color accuracy and brightness but the difference is minimal.-Moving from screen to screen is actually very fluid if you're just going between basic apps. It gets a little choppy when going between more complex games and other screens but it's not bad.-Battery life is so-so, about the same as the iPhone 4s.-I like the live tiles. You get a little info from the app without having to open it.Cons-It's Windows 8.1 and it is enough to run a smartphone and provide decent features, but it just doesn't provide the same quality of user experience as either iOS 7 or Android 4.x. Windows looks very bland compared to the others and it is just not as intuitive. It's hard to explain until you use each one side by side. I find myself looking at the screen a lot, trying to decode Microsoft's icons where with ios7, every icon is labeled so I don't have to open something before I find out what it is.-As it's been pointed out many times, the Windows App Library is lacking compared to Android or iOS. The two games I play on a regular basis are not available for Windows phone. Another productivity app I use for work is not there either.-The email app uses colors and fonts that are difficult to read unless you are looking closely at the phone. For example, with the iPhone, I would walk from my car to work and scan through my emails, being able to easily read the subject line and the first few lines of text from an email while in stride. With the Lumia, I have to hold the phone much closer to my eyes to read anything in the email app and the issue is much worse in sunlight or partial sunlight.So basically it's good enough. That's pretty much it. Once my AT&amp;T line is upgrade-eligible again, I'll be going back to iOS.",2014年8月19日 在美国审核
"Good hardware, good software, not so good when used strictly as an mp3 player","Summary:Competent device for the price, not good if only being used as an mp3 player (has a volume issue).I purchased this Nokia Lumia GoPhone strictly to be used as a mp3 player/mini tablet to replace my ipod nano (my nano was having terrible battery life). I wanted something that I could take to the gym, or listen to while working so I wouldn't drain the battery on my regular smartphone. I also wanted a device that allowed me to just drag and drop my media files so I wasn't forced to use some clunky 3rd party software (i.e., Itunes). This Nokia offered more bang for the buck than any other mp3 player I could find within this price range (was mainly looking at sandisk mp3 players within the same price range).Pros:-This device has a sleek simple design-Functions well (for the price)-Windows Phone 8.1 OS is easy to use-Great battery life especially when just listening to music (can listen for 5+ hours and still have 60%+ battery left)-Transferring files on the device is straight forward i.e., drag and drop files to the micro SD card-Can accept up to a 32 GB micro SD card for extra storage (has 8 GB internal storage)Cons:-App support is (currently) limited on the Windows phone format,compared to apple and android (don't expect the same volume of apps)-Customization on Windows Phone 8.1 OS is limited compared to other formats I've used (e.g., android)-The volume adjust on this device is poor when listening to mp3s, for example, the volume goes from level 0 (no sound) to level 30 (loud). When adjusting the volume, there is a noticeable difference in volume from the level 5-30 range; however, there is no difference when adjusting the volume from 1-5 (0 just mutes the sound). So sometimes a song will be inherently louder and it is impossible to adjust the sound down to a comfortable level because levels 1-5 are all the same. I have read some things that say this is software related (i.e., on the windows phone 8.1 OS side) and others say it is Nokia related (i.e., hardware side); however, as of now there is no official fix to this problem. When using this device strictly as an mp3 player, this can become somewhat annoying. The only work around I have found is to adjust the volume within the mp3 itself using a normalization program. This takes a lot of time and can also be annoying if it has to be done every time a new song is added to the device.Overall, this smartphone is a competent device for the price. If you are planning to use this strictly as an mp3 player, I would consider doing more research and looking elsewhere until Nokia or Microsoft decides to fix the volume adjust problem.",2015年5月5日 在美国审核
Zippy fast cheap phone,"For the price it's a great phone!If you aren't tied to Android or iOS, Windows Phone 8 is a pretty good operating system that allows you almost all the same features now.This phone comes with some good bonuses like Nokia Drive (with it's ability to download offline maps) and Nokia Music (which can download songs and mixes for offline play) which I like much better than competing programs.I'll just say, Windows Phone 8.1 is cool but it's too heavy for this phone.I updated it and have enjoyed it, but it's no longer zippy fast as it was, so I'm considering flashing it back.*Update*-I peeled it back from Developers package to the retail Windows 8.1, it feels much faster but the browser crashes.At the price this phone goes for now, I won't complain.It's good enough I'd get a new Lumia.",2014年9月28日 在美国审核
"Perfect replacement phone for contract, or cheap go-phone.","Good little inexpensive phone. You can upgrade memory to 64GB for less than $50 and so makes a pretty good little handheld for games, music, photos, facebook or whatever even if you don't activate it as a phone. Used this to replace my son's broken Iphone 5 on our ATT contract and we were up and running within 30 minutes of walking into ATT store. PERFECT replacement phone, and might even consider as go-to phone at this price point and use the money you save on the Iphone to buy an Ipad!!

Easy phone to use for mom,"My brother and I got this phone for our mom.She has never had a smartphone, but was interested in e-mail and facebook, things she doesn't currently use in her personal life.We tried another phone, which had a pull out qwerty keyboard.She hated the phone, not user friendly at all, so we really wanted to get her something much more easy and intuitive to use.This phone fit the bill. We were able to take all the tiles off the home screen that she'll never use and make the ones on the home screen bigger and easier for her to tap.So far, she'es learned how to make calls, get voice mails and text.Next is facebook and e-mail, all of which we set up for her and now she just has to use.Very exciting for her.

"It's great, don't need a plan. But then, it's not a phone.","Love it. Works without a sim card. Does everything I want it to. So happy to not be confined to Apple's OS. I just wanted to have mobile internet that only worked within wifi range and this is exactly that. I downloaded a free texting app and now through wifi, I can msg my friends and it's totally free. Accepts SD cards and I've had no probs with the unit itself.I originally bought it for mp3 purposes but the Nokia music app is quite difficult to use. Creating playlists is nearly impossible. And their suggestions for music that are supposed to be similar to what you're listening to, are just terribly inaccurate. It's almost to the point, if you were listening to heavy death metal, it would play some poppy girl band stuff every so often. Aaand of course, to skip more than 5 times an hour, would require premium service. Anyways, I love the Lumia.",2014年10月30日 在美国审核
Great Phone and I have Cricket!,"I have Cricket, so I was nervous about purchasing this phone and it not working. Guess what, IT WORKS, and it's great, it's awesome. I absolutely love Windows (probably because I actually know how to use it!)! I like how easily it access the internet, the BLU phone I bought was crap, couldn't pick up signal anywhere, so I guarantee it had nothing to do with the signal towers. I love that I can play games, check my e-mail (which is a biggy for me), surf the web, and an app that shows me local shops/events/ and so forth!I recommend getting this phone if you have AT&amp;T or Cricket, it does everything I'd like it to do without any problems.

The best cheap phone,"I bought this as a backup when I sold my android phone and I was waiting for the new one.I have to mention that I've owned several high end android phones the last 4 years and a couple of cheap ones.So why I like this windows phone if I'm an android fan? Because android runs differently depending on the device and sometimes cheap android phones are terrible but that doesn't happen with this Nokia windows phone.I paid 30 for this and what I got was a well built device, with a OS that runs smoothly despite the low speciffications, good enough battery life, cortana and all the things that now are basic on a phone like gps, wifi, 4g, etc.So if you are in a budget you won't find a better phone.",2015年3月15日 在美国审核
OK replacement phone.,"I got this as a replacement for my Samsung galaxy. This phone freezes from time to time, especially when using certain apps like Audible. I actually hate the windows phone compared to the android and probably should have tested a windows phone out in the store before purchasing one. Over all this is a good phone for the money.UPDATE: For what it's worth, I did an update two weeks ago, and now my phone cuts itself on and on, about 3 or 4 times a day. I did a reset, and it still does the on and off thing, so I'm planning on gettinga new phone in a couple months, and don't think I'd purchase a Lumia phone again.After using this phone for a couple months, it not as good as I first thought.",2014年8月17日 在美国审核
Does It's Job:,"I use this phone for mainly texts, calls, podcasts' and sometimes facebook. It can be challenging to find a relatively cheap phone that will do all that for me, but this does. On top of that it has a decent camera, great layout (if you're a fan of windows), and has room for upping the phone's storage if you find you're downloading a lot of silly apps just for the thrill.The only downsides are that the screen can be unresponsive at times, and its battery will run out quickly if you use it excessively, as with most phones.

"At $70, what more can you ask for?","I got this phone for $70, which is not the lowest it was at ($40) but still a very cheap price.First the pros:*Very touch sensitive display. Can even be used with thin gloves!*About 4.7GB of free space (OS takes up the rest) built into the phone.*Great audio quality and reception. This rivals or beats every other phone I've had except maybe the Lumia 710. Can't vouch for the microphone quality as I haven't asked any of my friends how I sound on the other side.*WP8 (up to each individual to perceive this as a pro or con. I personally like the user interface but am eagerly waiting for a notification center and the ability to pin settings to the home screen and IE to save user names and passwords and... the list goes on).*Snappy speed when it comes to accessing built-in features.*reasonably good camera, especially for its price.*Nice responsive keyboard. I've had a few android devices and am always amazed that the touch input is still about twice as laggy as Iphone. I'm glad Microsoft chose to go the Apple route and design their OS on responding to touch as fast as possible. It isn't always consciously noticeable but the keyboards on IOS and WP8 have quicker hap-tic feedback and feel more ""crisp"" than any Android device Ive ever used (including the 2013 Nexus 7). The only area Android bests their competition is with swype. Swyping is FAST once one gets used to it.Now the cons:*About 1.5-2 days of battery life with light usage. I know this is typical for smartphones but I would love to have 5 days with light usage like I used to with my Nokia E71.*Mediocre display. Some people might complain about the 800x400 or so resolution but to be honest that is enough for a phone of this size. The issues with the display are its viewing angles, washed out colors, low max brightness, and no oleo-phobic coating.*3-5 second load times (sometimes up to 10 seconds?!?) when opening applications, including Nokia applications that have first party status.*sharp feeling corners/edges when the phone is pressed to the ear. This is fairly bothersome, and I need to always keep the phone away from my ear a little because of this.*WP8 eye candy is kind of slow to transition between views. Microsoft should include the ability to speed up the animations.*capacitive buttons at the bottom of the screen are hard to press consistently, the active area is not well defined visually. This has been a problem I've had with all my touchscreen phones. I guess I just hate capacitive buttons at the bottom of phones...Bottom line, the hardware in this phone is above average for late 2013 (taking into account more than just the CPU). WP8 lags less than Android for user interface touch actions but it takes longer for applications to open. If you don't mind WP8 and considering $70 price tag, the performance of this phone is phenomenal and is definitely worth it.",2014年1月22日 在美国审核
"""Sim invalid""","When we opened the box and put the sim in, it kept saying ""sim invalid"" or ""no sim."" This was very frustrating since the people at AT&amp;T couldn't help me. The phone was basically unusable right out of the box. I had to do some research and found a forum that said to put tape on the back of the sim and then reinsert it. I did this and amazingly it then worked! Apparently the sim slot is not tight enough for the sim to touch the copper areas without the tape making it sit in the sim slot more snug. This seems to be a common problem with these phones, so buyer beware or at least try the tape trick!",2016年3月31日 在美国审核
Good deal,"I live in the boonies, so I occasionally have dropped calls when I'm on country roads. But everything works well and it was easy to set up. Never had a Windows phone, so I didn't realize I had to swipe horizontally on my call list to get to my voicemail, instead of dialing like I'm used to. You just click on the missed called and it plays the message like a little mp3 file. Nifty because it doesn't burn up minutes. I don't really need that many ways to take a picture, but I do like that I could easily add my school email to the home screen.

It's very easy to customize.I find the quality of the phone to be exceptional for its price point. I especially like the sensitivity of the touch screen which works as well as more expensive smartphones.The camera is ok and comes with a lot of apps to edit your pictures which is fun.I find most of the Android apps that I use to be better developed, but hopefully Windows will catch up in this area.All in all, a great starter or replacement smartphone and it is refreshing to see that AT&amp;T is finally offering a good quality smartphone at an affordable price.",2013年9月13日 在美国审核
Great phone for less than the cost of a phone case,"I purchased this phone for my daughter, and purchased a Nokia 635 for myself. While the build quality on the 635 is great for a sub $100 phone, it was actually a little nicer on the 520. The glass has a smoother feel and doesn't attract finger prints as much, and the back has a nice curve to it and high quality soft touch material. Considering this phone costs as much as cases do for other phones, calling it an incredible value is an understatement. Hats off to Nokia for making great phones at a great price. The navigation software on this phone is excellent and allows you to download maps and use it without using data.

This is a great phone to have when you lose your main phone,This is a great phone to have when you lose your main phone. Very affordable and a 3 star for functionality. These days people run on apps and unfortunately not enough companies have developed apps for Windows based phones. I love the look and feel of Windows 8 but there needs to be an incentive for people to build more apps. The UI is great and the phone feels like it can take more damage than an iPhone. This is definitely not some high end phone but is perfect for when your main phone is damaged or if you are traveling and want to use something that would not make you cry if you lost it. This would be a 4 star if there were more common apps. Not Microsoft's fault but this limits the use of the phone.,2014年8月19日 在美国审核
Great Value,"Great value.First,I am not a cell phone addict.I have had an AT&amp;T talk and text only pay as you go plan for over 10 years and it is a perfect fit for me.I wanted to upgrade from my LG Shine with a 2 mp camera and non- qwerty keyboard but did not want to spend a mega amount of money.This phone is perfect.Yes, it is a smart phone but it can be used with a talk and text/ no data plan.Simply go into settings and turn off the data.(Warning...To receive pictures people send to you in a text message, you must turn the data plan to ""on"".My no data plan then charges an extra 5 cents over the cost of a regular text message.) The best feature of this phone/ upgrade from my previous phone is that it is WiFi enabled so when I am in a WiFi hot spot, I can check my email, weather forecasts, etc.When it arrived, I was not sure it was going to work with my old plan as my SIM card did not fit.That was easily resolved with a trip to our local AT&amp;T store.They simply gave me a new sim and transferred all my contacts and my go phone plan and balance to the new sim for free.",2014年8月18日 在美国审核
Uh oh its CARRIER LOCKED what do I do with it!,"If you made the mistake of purchasing this phone thinking to use it overseas, or on TMobile over here, and just discovered it is ""locked"" to AT&amp;T (even though you own it and thought ""no contract"" meant ""unlocked""), there are still a lot of useful things to do with, apart from fuming:1. Out of the box, insert battery, power it up, and go to Settings.2. Set ""Airplane Mode"".3. Power off, remove battery, insert the provided GoPhone SIM.- The SIM is essential for downloading Nokia Here Maps, which are GREAT.4. Go to Settings, turn on WiFi mode. Don't turn off Airplane Mode! Leave it the way you set it in step 2.- Airplane Mode keeps the phone from searching for a cellular carrier and forcing you to activate the phone.5. There are some advantages to having a Microsoft Outlook free email account. Go to outlook &lt;dot&gt; com and get a free account if you don't already have one.6. Go to Settings and add some Accounts:- Microsoft (your new or existing Outlook account).- Nokia (for free and purchased apps from the Store).- Google, FaceBook, Yahoo! Mail, Twitter, LinkedIn, IBM Notes Traveler, and generic POP and IMAP accounts are your other choices.7. While in Settings use the ""left arrow"" a permanent below-the-screen left arrow to move back to the main Settings menu and set Brightness to High with no automatic control. This works best except in dim settings like on an airplane with lights out, where I use Low for Kindle reading.8. On the same first page of Settings, scroll down to Phone Update and check for system updates. You should already have the ""Black"" update set, 8.1 will come out in a couple of months. Check about once a week.9. Apps will update too, a number will appear on the Live Tile for Store. Sometimes important updates like FaceBook are announced but the Store won't auto update right away - you can force an update by searching for that app, then clicking on it, and clicking manually on the update bar that appears.10. Download these apps (my favorites, YMMV):- WhatsApp, Line, Viber. Or your favorite message/free phone call solution.- Most of these require an active phone number to work. If you use your other phone's number, that will erase your account on that other phone, when you use the text supplied PIN to activate on the Lumia 520. That might change someday, but for now linkage to phone numbers is a limitation.- Skype. Works REALLY well on the Lumia 520.- Kindle. Works so-so. I read a couple of books inflight so it isn't screen sharpness that is the problem. The problem is a little Amazon software funkiness that occasionally cuts off a line or two of text between pages. To fix, rotate from book orientation to landscape to read your text then rotate back. The rotation seems to fix the problem.- Facebook. Fine for consumption, not so fine for editing your posts or comments. Much improved over last year.- Facebook MESSENGER. Yes, it is a separate app, and more and more people use it, is a good substitutes for WhatsApp, Line, Viber, and Facebook doesn't care how many devices you have it on. A mature product on Lumia 520. Be sure to pay attention to the little delta wing that rats out your location - default is on, so you WILL be tracked by friends and frenemies. Well tracked when you answer a message.11. From the home screen - press the Home soft button on the bottom of the screen - flick the screen to the left to see the list of apps, all the apps, and open HERE Maps.- Choose your state and download your map.- Going to Dublin? etc? download that map. The maps don't take up a lot of space.- Yes, GPS works without cellular service, so long as you downloaded the map. Remember, the maps won't download if you didn't put your SIM card in (you can remove it later, but why bother?).12. Some good exercise apps that work well with the LOUD speaker on this tiny phone:- 7 Minute Scientific.- Tabatas.13. For music:- Because it has the necessary licenses from MicroSoft, 64gb and even 128gb micro SD's fit and work fine. I use a 64gb to hold almost all my music.- It will play current iTunes tracks fine (everything except the early DRM digital rights management copy protected tunes), mp3. it will not play Ogg Vorbis.- The player is called Music &amp; Videos and comes stock; until updates, it might appear as Nokia Music or as xBox, Nokia Mix Radio is a separate app which provides free streaming music from Nokia. Very cool!REMEMBER, all this is WITHOUT cellular phone service!You have a camera, music player, GPS unit, e-reader, and minimalist web browser, all in a $60 or so package! And the option of using it to back up your AT&amp;T and AT&amp;T driven phone service, if you need it.SHORTCOMINGS:1. Due to the 512mb memory limitation, app switching is painfully slow. NOT unusably slow, but by modern standards PITA slow.2. A few games and rare apps won't run in a 512mb footprint. Before you go ballistic on this memory limitation, keep in mind the iPad 2 and original Mini are both 512mb. Like Apple, though, MicroSoft uses compiled code for its apps - more efficient - than Android, which ""compiles code"" on the fly via an interpreter - hence Android needs faster processors and more RAM (but in current editions and with modern hardware, Android is plenty fast).3. This is DVD resolution, not HD. It is 800x480, not one of the higher resolutions. The type looks crisp, not pixelated, but you don't get as much information per screen on websites or Kindle, and the screen - for resolution AND quality reasons - isn't good for serious video watching.4. No front camera. This is a BIGGIE for many selfie fans. On the rear, no FLASH but the camera DOES autofocus. I don't like flash, I prefer natural light even if the picture goes grainy etc. so I'm ok with this.UNEXPECTED SURPRISE:1. The battery life is absolutely incredible, with cellular radio turned off via the Airplane Mode switch.2. Nokia continues to roll out major software updates for this amazing little helper - even Win Phone 8.1 is coming to the 520, which means being able to run apps from the uSD card and, finally, being able to set ringer and music volumes separately (saves ears, that).So I've found plenty of uses for my Lumia 520, even if it isn't good for travel or TMob. I wish it were unlocked, and would have paid more for an unlocked one from Nokia (if they sold unlocked phones direct, like Google and Motorola and Apple do), but my buyer's mistake hasn't turned into buyer's remorse.You will be blown away by the design, looks, and quality of this little bargain.",2014年4月8日 在美国审核

Great Budget Phone/ Alternative Media Device,"This review is for the entire phone even though I only use it exclusively for media purposes.I bought this device as a means to replace a broken iPod 2nd Gen which finally broke after 6-7 years of usage. I needed a replacement for my iPod since I don't think its wise to risk my iPhone 6 breaking every time I exercise in a gym or go jogging. I think its ludicrous to drop $300 before tax on a brand new 64GB iPod Touch for the reasons I'd be using it for. After researching on the internet, I found several users who used this phone (unactivated) as a media only device.I paid a total of $33 for the phone including tax (rounded), and its probably the best investment I've made. Since I don't have it activated I'm unable to call or text, but that's not what I bought it for in the first place so its fine. I initially purchased this device solely for the ability to listen to music on an affordable device. However, the extra features that I received vastly over exceeded my expectations for such a device.&lt;Phone Aspect&gt;The phone is a decent-small size and feels sturdy in the hand. The screen though is pretty lackluster with low pixel density, subpar screen resolution and not great lighting, but for the price you pay there's no complaints. The positioning on the home screen button underneath the volume control buttons is a little bothersome since anyone with medium to larger hands have difficulty pressing it with their thumb. The removable back plate and option to replace battery are wonderful additions to this phone. There's no front camera, so those who take selfies and use skype are a little out of luck. The back camera is pretty good for a phone of this price though. Most of the people that have used smart phones are probably use to Android or iOS, but this phone runs on Windows. The live tiles and overall user interface are different to what most of us are comfortable with, but it didn't take long to adapt to. It's fairly simple to use and navigate and there aren't any bugs or problems that I am aware of. The option of upgrading memory is one I wish all smart phones have, this however does and its fantastic! The phone comes with 8GB of stock memory which around 2.5 are used up by the phone itself for the system, leaving very little memory. However the option to include a microSD allows it to expand anywhere up to 128GB more memory (for anyone who can afford a 128GB microSD).&lt;Features and Apps&gt;The phone once updated to Windows 8.1 includes Cortana (Windows Personal Assistant). Which is a delight to use, its fairly accurate in understanding my voice requests. Also, with the 8.1 update there includes a notification pull-down such as in Android from the top screen. This notification pull-down also allows screen rotation, airplane mode, wifi settings, and bluetooth as well. Unlike my previous iPod it allows me to use Pandora, Netflix and social media apps that weren't supported under my old iPod due to Apple not supporting updates to older models. Nokia's maps called Here Maps are probably my favorite feature. They work offline once you download the map for your country,state or province. The app store is not something that one would be excited for as it lacks a lot of variety compared to Apple or Google. It does contain basically all major apps that one would want with a few exceptions.For $33, plus the option of a microSD card if you need more memory (I paid $25 for 64GB). You get a basic smart phone that can make calls and texts; plays videos, music and games; and includes all other basic smart phone functions (camera, calculator, etc). It has a personal assistant in Cortana, along with a built in GPS system that works offline with no connectivity required. No other device offers all this for the same price range, which makes this a great purchase.",2014年12月4日 在美国审核

No brainer; excellent quality for and excellent price.,"I have service with AT&amp;T with an old Samsung Galaxy S2 that finally gave up the ghost. New phones are so expensive and the new S6 release date is only a month away so I wanted something temporary as well as something to keep around as a spare. I thought for the price; what is there to loose? Nokia is a top of the line in quality, indestructible phone.Package came a day early and was able to use it the same day after going to AT&amp;T for a proper sized SIM card (my old S2 SIM was too big and I didn't want to deal with ordering a card cutter).Again, the quality of the phone is phenomenal. It's fast, simple with more features than I'll ever use. The voice app on text messaging and email is the best I've ever seen! The keyboard is a bit smaller but you just have to turn it and use the rotate mode for a wider board.*Note* Had to install a systems update before I could upgrade to Windows 8.1 to be compatible with Gmail/Google apps. It didn't take long.I could say more about what an unbelievable quality product this is for the price but it's kind of a no brainer. Would highly recommend this phone. E",2015年3月23日 在美国审核

Great Backup Phone...especially when unlocked.,"I, originally, purchased this phone to experience the Windows Phone OS in depth. I also plans to unlock it so it could be used internationally this summer. I managed to get it unlocked and have since used it on T-Mobile. Oddly enough, in my experience, the phone has better service with T-Mobile than AT&amp;T. After my sister faced a small mishap with her own phone she used it as a temporary phone. She fell in love with it, with the exception of a few things. It a) has no flash, b) has no front facing camera, c) Strongly prefers wifi over cellular data, and d)YouTube/Snapchat (Webapp and no app).

Very uncomfortable and painful when using the Nokia Lumia 520 with one hand,"Guys, here's are some reasons why this thing is dirt cheap and the points I deducted from its rating.-1 point (minus one point) for the square icons. It's ugly and looks outdated and cheap to boot. Period.-1 point for very user-unfriendly packaging. This is the most difficult plastic package to open that I've encountered since thistype of packaging was invented.You'll need a hacksaw or zombie teeth to open this one.And make sure you have medical insurance before you open the package in case you cut yourself.-1 point for the square case design and sharp pointed corners. Very uncomfortable and painful when using the Nokia Lumia 520 with one hand. The bottom corners just dig into the palm of your hands. Who ever designed this was probably someone who was fired from AppleComputers.-1 point for the unsorted Screen Settings screen. Here's an excerpt from a windowsphone forum commenting on a suggestion by users to sort the settings screen in Windows Phone:"". . .The fact that there even has to be a ""feature suggestion"" (with 8500 votes) to do something as stunningly boring and obvious as arranging things in alphabetical order, says a whole lot about why Microsoft smart phones are a distant third in the race between Apple and Android. Hello Microsoft! Wake up!""I'm a Windows user. All the way back since DOS 3.3. I don't own a Mac. But, I do remember a quote attributed to Steve Jobs about Microsoft.""The problem with Microsoft is that it simply has no taste (in designing products)"". So now, I understand what he meant. Too bad he is dead. I missed him.On the positive side, I like the camera although I wish they had put in flash and a front facing camera. I also like the fact that it isrecognized by Windows automatically when connected by cable. Wifi works great. It has a removable battery (this became a major deal breaker for the iPhones for me, 1+ point for the Lumia), and it has removable storage (something which the iPhone doesn't have also, 1+ point again for the Lumia).Would I buy this again?

Amazing phone! I got it when it was on ...,"Amazing phone! I got it when it was on Today's Deals--for $19.99. I only had to stick in my old SIM Card (which I had used on an older phone for some time) and, voila, I got a SIMPLE AND LIGHT but FAST, MODERN, AND POWERFUL NEW SMARTPHONE!I've been using it for two weeks and have never had any problems with it. As soon as I started using it with my old SIM card (which already has a data plan with AT&amp;T), it offered updates. I followed the update offer a couple of times. The third update offer was for Windows 8.1, the newest version of Windows Mobile! It took some time to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, but as long as your phone is plugged to the wall charger, you should be okay. Also, activate your Wifi first before starting the update/grade. It will save your data plan.Now, my phone is already on Windows 8.1. It has Cortana (which is the Windows equivalent of SIRI) and it can do Swype (which is typing without tapping, in other words, you just swipe your finger frim letter ""M"" to ""O"" to ""V"" to ""E"" and you get the word ""move"" on your screen).The only thing I usually need but is missing from this phone is gyroscope, which makes me unable to find direction/get the compass function (well, I'm a Muslim who needs to pray five times a day facing the ka'bah in Meccah, and it's such a convenient to always have a compass at hand). The other thing that NOKIA can improve for its future products is the backlight for the soft buttons (I mean those ""back,"" ""home,"" and ""search"" buttons). A backlight for these buttons will help operating the phone in the dark, on the bed, right before we sleep--for example, when we need to set up the alarm before sleeping. :)All in all, as a person who embraces change, I found my transition from iPhone to Nokia LUMIA 520 very rejuvenating!",2015年1月5日 在美国审核

Best phone for the price!!! Buy 2 or 3 or 4 for the same price of another ok phone.,"This phone is great as backup or throw around phone. I have had other flagship phones, and to compare this phone to any of those would be crazy, but considering the 30 bucks it cost this is the best deal for a phone. I have had a few variations of this phone the 520, 521, etc. and I have always like them. I usually give to family members when they need a phone if they lose or break their main device as a place holder. I currently use mine specifically for media and for the built in GPS function in my car. I also have tons of music saved on the sd card along with movies so its great for those long drives home, and keeps my main phone free and charged for when I really need it. I do use the phone for actual phone calls but using a 3rd party company using at&amp;t's network, currently I'm using H20, but may switch it to pure talk. Again this is just a backup phone for an emergency so its usually in my car or its in my messenger bag, I have used it for Skype calls which work fairly well with good internet connection.Really the only things I have to complain about are: Small, fairly dim screen(for price I can't complain too much), windows store has come a long way but many apps I love especially for media are either non-existent or you have to pay (i.e. mkv players are paid if you want them without advertisements),lastly connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots such as xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots has proven unsuccessful( may not be something for all people but for people looking to use this on a budget may want to look out for that). Besides that Love the phone, may pick up a few more before they go off of special or discontinued and have them as extras for family and friends.In my opinion if you get the phone and don't like it, it is because 1. You have to high of expectations for a phone that cost less than 1 month of phone service , 2.

What an amazing phone.,"This is my first Windows phone.I was a little hesitant because of the memory that it would be sluggish, but it is really very nice.This phone was my daughter's first phone, and I think, although not quite and iPhone 5s, it makes a very good smart phone, which i wouldn't mind replacing my iPhone 5s with.I miss not having a flash on the camera (to use as a flashlight - not as a camera flash).At 1/10th the cost of an iPhone 5s, this will likely be my personal phone in the event I had to find a replacement.",2014年4月30日 在美国审核
Windows 8.1 Cyan Update,"I was skeptical about ordering this phone. I heard many good reviews and watched endless tutorials on the quality and capabilities. THE REVIEWS DO IT NO JUSTICE! This phone for the price has exceeded my expectations 30 fold!Although this does not have a flash for the camera, it does have many great editing apps to help optimize picture quality. The browser is fast, it handles 4G speeds. You can go to Straight Talk and order an ATT compatible SIM card for only $45 a month, UNLIMITED EVERYTHING! I am amazed with the quality for the price. I would give this phone a 6 out of five if I could. Windows is definitely going somewhere 😃",2014年9月27日 在美国审核
Best ever!!!,"My first smartphone and I love it! Thought it would take me forever to learn, it didn't. I have seen other android phones, and I like the Windows phone better. So easy to use! If you have a Windows computer you will have no problem. I have games on there, so my son loves it, The camera takes wonderful pics, and comes with very cool apps for editing them. It doesn't have the front facing camera, but I don't need to take selfies anyway. I think for my next phone I will stick with the Nokia Lumia but upgrade the model. But for the price I absolutely LOVE this phone!!! Thanks Nokia for continuing to make great phones :)",2014年5月17日 在美国审核
Worth every penny,"I bought this mainly for the offline GPS and as an emergency backup phone.The offline GPS alone is worth the dirt cheap price. The OS is smooth, quick, and straight forward. Don't experience any lag or bug, but I this is also not use as my daily device. Also has FM radio too.I left out one star due to Windows Phones OS terrible selection of apps. If the app selection were to get much better, then I might give the Lumia 1520 a try. But until then, I'll have to stay away from any Windows Phone as my main device.I use this with Wifi only at home, no sim card inserted. And just the GPS with I'm on my motorbike.",2014年8月16日 在美国审核
You can't get better than this for a no-contract budget phone,"I bought this for a friend who needed a very basic smartphone to do her mail and take snapshots. Given that she got a full-featured phone that even provides high-end GPS functions and the Cortana (Siri-like) assistant, it's an amazing phone, especially considering the costs. It is of course missing stuff, including a front-facing camera - probably the biggest drawback for use by teens who seem to all be into selfies. I strongly recommend this for very budget-conscious needs. I recommend the 635 as step up (still a budget phone, but improved performance and it even supports the high-speed LTE cellular network).",2014年9月9日 在美国审核
Great Value,"For $40, what more could you ask for?Outside of no rear flash or front facing camera, this phone will do everything you could ask for.The storage is a bit small, so I would invest in a microSD card, 32GB can be had for about $12 shipped.The screen resolution is noticeable at 800x480 compared to the newer phones with 1080p screens, but for someone new to smartphones, and considering the price, its no big deal.Compact enough, lightweight, and durable, with Nokia quality.Highly recommended for almost any reason you'd want a cell phone.The OS runs smooth and WP8.1 has matured quite a bit, arguably putting in on par with Android and iOS, and in some instances, ahead.",2014年6月3日 在美国审核

(for someone who's never owned an Iphone) It has so many features: voice text, app downloads, tons of storage, and takes awesome pictures and videos (to name a few of my faves) It is a Microsoft windows phone. Not a problem for me. You can rearrange the icons however you want and delete the ones you don't need. The phone was packaged almost way too good, took me twenty mins to get it out!

Another is while I is in my pocket, and I go to sit down, the pressure between my pants and my thigh against my phone causes it to reset(or maybe the vibration/impact is at fault again) last instance is when I am listening to music.

Love it!,"Despite price tag (19.99 with ""lightning"" deal) this phone is very good. OS (WP 8.0) works like a charm. It is fast and fluid, apps loading in fractions of seconds. Personally I love what Microsoft did to his OS. No matter how cheap your hardware, you get good performance anyways. Screen vivid and bright. Removable battery. Micro SD slot up to 64 GB.This phone locked to AT&amp;T. But you can unlock it absolutely free. This phone does not have contract on it so I guess 6 month rule does not apply to it. Any ways, I unlocked it by going to support page and creating unlock request. After 2 days they sent me unlock code.",2015年2月9日 在美国审核
Excellent cheap phone with many plan options.,"Best phone for the $40 price! Works well right out of the box, just be sure to get the OS update, it has more features and a nicer user interface.The only downside is the camera but I wasn't expecting much out of a $40 smartphone. There is no front facing cam and no flash on the back cam, but the night mode seems to work just fine for dark photos.Windows app store is seriously lacking, but the preset Nokia apps are really cool, I especially like the Lumia Cinemagraph, it lets you animate parts of a photo and can get really creepy really fast.Overall, it's a really nice phone, Cortana is a good competitor for Siri, and some of the preset apps went beyond expectations.",2014年11月19日 在美国审核
Purchased as a backup phone.,I purchased this phone when my android died as a temporary phone since it was on sale for $20. I used it for less than a week as a phone. You have to sign into Microsoft to do anything with the phone. It would freeze constantly after updating and would just shut off for no reason. I ended up purchasing a new Android phone the next week with no issues. I would only recommend using this phone as a mp3 player and for wifi.

Decent low cost smart phone. Nothing fancy,Very good functional phone. Windows system has some advantages for people not technically inclined. Synchronizes contacts so that you can see them on your windows computer by signing into same account. Nothing super fancy but has features needed in smart phone. Same issue with Microsoft that you have with Google if you get an android phone. Good value for the dollar. I have bought four of these for friends and family members and one had defective ringer. It would vibrate and not ring. Did not bother to try and repair because too much hassle for phone which cost under $40.,2015年7月12日 在美国审核

Great phone!  Worth more than the price.  MS Phone OS family controls are poor.,"Fantastic phone for the price!Can't be beat! Poor family safety controlsFor the price-point, the Lumia 520 itself is a great device!I'm still in awe that I can purchase a phone of this quality for such a low price.If you're looking for a second phone for a back-up or even as an inexpensive primary phone, you can't go wrong.It's not the most intuitive device (iOS phones are) or the most configurable (Android) but it's a great alternative to either.Lightweight phone, the dimensions match those of an iPhone 5, though the screen quality isn't the best in the market - but when you consider you're paying a fraction of the price of an iPhone, the Lumia screen is amazing.The major pro, as everyone has noted, is the price.Who should consider this phone:- If you're not looking for a powerhouse of a processor to run 3D games, you should seriously consider this phone.- If your needs don't extend beyond FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, non-complex web-browsing, and texting(not to say you can't do other things)- If you're going on vacation and want to be able to browse and check your email at the beach and not worry about losing or damaging your phone- If you lose your current phone and want a temporary phone until you upgrade to one that will cost you 50x or more- If you want a starter phone for your kids (more on this later) and are afraid of them losing or breaking a more expensive model- If you're new to the world of smartphones and want to make sure you really need one- If you're looking for a great substitute to an iPod Touch- If you want an navigation deviceSome great features:- The built-in GPS works even if you don't use or pay for phone connectivity!It offers offline maps with turn by turn navigation- Supports Micro SD cards up to 64GB storage for photos and music.Note that you need to go into settings to redirect your storage to the SD card- Microsoft Windows Phone OS is beautiful.Active tiles really come to life on your phone.- Free music streaming Nokia/Microsoft MixRadio.- Replaceable battery: if you find that after a year or more your battery isn't holding its charge like it used to, just buy a new one instead of having to replace the entire phone- Replaceable back cover: you can buy additional covers to suit your tastes- The display is quite readable.For a phone this size it's perfect.- The price for cases for the Lumia 820 are quite reasonable!- Dedicated photo button right on the side!This is a fantastic feature as you don't have to fumble with the screen to launch the photo app or snap a picture.- Great battery life- Standard micro-usb connector - no longer having to spend for proprietary cords like you do with an iPhone- Microsoft Cortana!Who shouldn't consider this phone:- Users who are looking to run 3D games- Users who wish the latest apps; though the MS app store is growing, it pales in comparison to iOS or Android- Users who are already financial vested in iOS or Android Apps- Users who wish to share purchases among family members (more later)- Users looking for a fantastic phone camera.- Parents who wish to setup family controlsThings to keep in mind- There is no front facing camera.If you want to take selfies or do Video-Skype. this isn't the phone for you- There is no flash, though on my iOS and Android devices I rarely ever use flash.But it is something to consider if you're thinking of going on vacation and this being your only phone; you won't get many clear evening/nighttime shots indoors or outdoors.- The single speaker is located on the back of the phone; put this down phone faceing up and your music or speaker-phone conversation will be muted.(My daughter uses her Lumia 820 as her music player and unlike on our iOS devices, she has to pick up the Lumia each time she wants to look for a song or do anything with it.Not a major inconvenience, and certainly not something that should stop you from getting this phone, but definitely something to be aware of.)- The Lumia 820 vibrates instead of beeping as you move through the OS.It's a gentile vibration but I wish I could replace it with a sound or turn it off entirely.- Sometimes the phone is slow in rendering web-pages.This is probably due to only having 512mb.Each of these little details (where the speakers are placed, the position of the camera in relation to how you hold your phone, what type of charger it users...) contribute to one's overall satisfaction with a product.Would I buy it again?At this price? Without a doubt!-----------Some thoughts from myself as a parent who bought Lumia 820s as mp3/camera/eventual-phones for his two kids; more of a review of Microsoft Phone OS when it comes to parental controls than the physical phone itself.Skip the rest of this review if you're not looking for a phone for your kids.I'm new to the Windows Phone OS environment, having used both Android and iOS devices and I'm so disappointed by MS lack of vision when it comes to family dynamics.alternateI was looking for an inexpensive device to give to my kids to use as a music player, camera, and controlled web-browsing/application access.For about double the price I could have purchased a bare-bones Android phone but I've heard such great things about Windows Phone OS that for the price of the 820 I figured it was worth a shot.The Windows Family Safety site (familysafety.microsoft.com) allows a parent to filter web content and gives a child who has a desktop Windows 7/8 account to- Request access to blocked sites- Set daily time limits- Set a variety curfew hours which block all accessThere's also a link to Windows Phone: ""Add and monitor a Windows Phone"" which turns out to not only launch a totally separate and weak parental control model (MyFamily), but as far as I can see does not allow for any monitoring!The Windows Phone MyFamily app control is extremely bare-bones -- You can set a content rating limit- You can block all apps, allow free apps, or allow for any app to be downloaded.That's it.There doesn't appear to be a way to have your child request an app from a parent nor are there any time limit settings or even more importantly, filter web sites!Add on top of this an extremely bare and not-at-all intuitive text-based interface (how do you get to Family Safety from your log in page?- Click on ""Security and Privacy"" in the web-toolbar (not in the manage section)- Under ""Online Safety"" you'll find two choices:---- Family safety settings---- Manage permissions for children""Manage Permissions for children"" doesn't manage any permissions! Insteadyou can edit your child's name and contact details.""Family Safety Settings"" doesn't allow you to add children - Instead what you or your child need to do is setup a Microsoft Account for them.And then, based on the birth-year that's setup for this profile (Under 18? Under 13?) the child-account will then be prompted to have their parent log into their parent's Live account.This will link the child account to the parents.So rather than having a parent whose already logged in create an account for their child, the parent needs to log out and then log back in to create and link a child-account.How is this intuitive?Once you finally have your child's Live account created and linked you'll be able to control thier PC access (if you've setup a separate Windows account for them) but you won't be able to control anything on their phone other than what kind of apps they can download - not which apps, but which kind of apps (none, all free apps, all apps).So since the only way you can control which apps your child can access is by blocking all apps, if there's a particular app you're OK with your child getting, you have to edit their permissions on the MS MyFamily site, log into your child's phone, get the app, and then go back and reset the permissions on the MS site again.As for sharing purchases, there doesn't appear to be a way to do it, therefore you probably need to buy an app for each family member.Another issue I have with Microsoft Phone is how its native apps are geared toward selling rather than focusing on your content.If you're looking for a device with good parental controls, get an Android device and install ""Screen Time Parental Control"" by Screen Time Labs and any friendly browser.BTW, I've also heard great things about Microsoft Cortana - any account registers as a child's account will be blocked from accessing Cortana until the child turns 14.Microsoft's rational is that since Cortana gathers user information (email, shopping, personal information such as birthday) to improve a users's experience and to COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), it is illegal for Microsoft to collect any information from children under 13, it's turned off.No way around it.The only solution would be to falsify your child's birth-year.Using a combination of MS MyFamily, OpenDNS, an Asus router running Asuswrt Merlin firmware, and client-based DSN-filtering, I've managed to cobble together controls that meet my needs (web filtering, morning and bedtime curfew, app controls), but definitely not a solution I recommend for someone whose not inclined to tinker.If you don't have an Asus router, you could probably achieve the same by setting up a VPN into Open DNS or through some other solution.",2014年12月27日 在美国审核
Great for the SHORT TERM - Temporary/Replacement Phone,"I bought this phone after my iPhone 5 broke. My contract didn't allow for an upgrade for another year, so I decided to buy a go phone. I stumbled upon this phone on amazon (as Im sure most of you did). I was quite impressed with its performance initially. After two or three months here is what I have to say about it:If you are buying this phone for the purpose of just using it as a short term replacement (from your lost or broken ""nice"" smartphone), then you found the right product.HOWEVER BEWARE: I would not recommend buying this phone if you need a reliable phone for longer than a two or three month period. Like many users have stated the hardware isn't the most durable and your main operating buttons for the phone WILL eventually FAIL. My home screen button stopped work after a week; but, this was fine to me because everything else operated seamlessly.. that is until today, one of my volume buttons stopped working. This makes it impossible for me to control my volume. And even under settings the operating system does not allow you to scroll up or down for sound. So basically I can't play music anymore through bluetooth, can't hear any alerts, or even turn up my alarm. This is a great backup or temporary phone but the quality of the hardware build is not top notch and that should be taken into consideration.P.S. the App store sucks(terrible apps besides Netflix and Spotify), and sure its no galaxy S4 or iPhone5, but for the price, it functions as a great temporary backup phone until your contract allows for a cheap upgrade on your actual smartphone.Summary: As your normal everyday cellphone you plan to use for two years = 2 Stars **As a temporary or replacement phone = 4 to 5 Stars ****",2014年1月16日 在美国审核

Great smartphone for the price!!,Picked up 4 of these phones. two for my boys for Christmas one for me as a back up phone and one for my best friend so that she has a back up phone and introduces her to Windows Phone 8. I have the Nokia Lumia 925 and it s great but I work at a sewage plant and it is nice to be able to swap my sim card and have a work phone. My oldest son will get service through go phone and my youngest isn't getting service but he will be able to use his on wifi and use it as a newer version of the Zune HD. My best friend has an iPhone 5c but likes the idea of having a backup phone too and since she has always been an iSheep I didn't think she would like not only the phone but windows phone 8 OS. She loves both. this may be a lower entry level lumia but is quite a fast and nice phone. for the price its silly not to grab one of these and see how nice of a job Microsoft has done with this OS. definitely recommend!!,2013年12月18日 在美国审核
Its an upgrade,"I bought this phone as an upgrade to my husbands tracfone. First of all he hates anything to do with paying too much for cell phone contracts, hence that is why he had a tracfone. To bring him into the 21st century I ran across this phone and it received good reviews so I figured I would try it out and the fact that it was on sale for $59.99 didn't hurt. I took the phone into a AT&amp;T retailer and she was able to port/transfer over his current number to the new gophone which was a big deal as he uses this number for work. After that it's been smooth sailing.This phone works great and currently uses the $25 plan which includes 250 minutes of talk, unlimited text and he just uses wi-fi so there is no need for a data plan. Besides I heard if you enable the data it will take the money out of your plan and your left with a balance of $0.The only negative that I would say is the lack of apps that windows offers and what they do offer it's not free. I realize this is a windows issue and not gophone but AT&amp;T needs to renegotiate.",2014年1月30日 在美国审核

Great phone for the money,"I use the Nokia 520 with straight talk, so my review only applies if you plan on using straight talk.I purchased this phone after destroying my expensive HTC one X.1. The phone will do an online backup, but after a resetting the phone, you only have one chance after the first reboot to restore your phone.The problem is that you have to use your phones data plan to do the restore and since you have to change the APN setting to use straight talk, you will not be able to do a restore.If the phone isn't unlocked, then you will have to borrow a SIM card from someone with AT&amp;t so you can connect to the internet and download the restore. (WINDOWS PHONES NOW LET YOU CONNECT TO WIFI IN INITIAL SETUP SO YOU CAN RESTORE THE PHONE)2. The restore doesn't remember how you have your tiles positioned.A lot of time can be spent organizing tiles. (THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CORRECTED WITH UPDATES TO WINDOWS 8.1)3.AT&amp;T has the internet sharing locked down on my phone.I had the phone unlocked, but I still can't get rid of the AT&amp;T lock on internet sharing.4. I really like the windows phone operating system.I will probably buy the new Nexus when it's released, but I'm not going to be in a big hurry.If I could get internet sharing working, then I would have no good reason to not stay with a windows phone.5.I get 4G data connections with straight talk.The best I've seen from android in this price range is 3G.6.Since the phone is so cheap, I don't worry about keeping it in a case.7.The Nokia GPS with offline maps is great, and all you have to do is create your nokia account.8.If you plug in headphones, then you can use the built in FM tuner in the phone.The phone uses the headphone cord as the antenna.9. The camera is ok, but there is no flash.10.The battery is removable.I'm always annoyed by devices that don't make it easy to replace a battery.I know most cell phones will be outdated by the time the battery dies, but I just like knowing that I can change the battery if I want to.11.The phone accepts micro SD cards.I like having expandable / removable memory cards on my devices.",2013年10月2日 在美国审核

For a price less than one month's service plan!.. at least a great music phone to finally chuck your iPod,"While the phone is rather crippled: no compass, no flashlight, no NFC, modest 5mpx camera, it's the kind of limitations I can live with at this price point.The device is less than the cost of one month's ATT GoPhone service plan (or prices of some of the fancy iPhone cases). Also fair to point out that this device retails for about $150 in the rest of the world. I think, had it been priced globally for $59 like here, it would be the world's best selling phone of all times.Now having rubbed in the affordability of the proposition, let's look at what it has to offer:- Genuine high quality Nokia smartphone. (And those US-run-Finns know how to make quality products that appeal to the US market.) The device is just beautifully made with nothing to complain about.- Robust to drops even without a protective case. Having used it for a month I realized that I had dropped the phone so many times on hard surfaces (including pavement and bathroom tile) and it is still fine aside from minor scratches around the edges. I know my iPhone bearing friends broke their screen this way. Nokia Lumia 520 just pops the back cover off and keeps safe.- Size it a perfect fit in your hand and it's slim too. Nice to grip in a call or hold while tapping away an email.- A great introduction to Windows Phone 8 (key reason I got it). WP8 is notorious for great integration with Microsoft Outlook service and I really wanted to try it out without getting stuck with the device for two years or committing $699 for a ""contract free"" top tier Lumia.- The device has MicroSD slot so for another $36 I got a 64Gb memory card and effectively got more storage than the largest iPod Touch to put most of my music collection on it.- The battery is removable, and while there is no reason you would want to swap it often as the charge last a full day of use, it is useful to have that functionality to swap the battery (removable BL-5J) and keep going in case you plan to be away from outlets for more than a day. I have a separate charging stand for Nokia batteries (DT-33) that can top off spares.- And last but not least, this holiday season as most places get wintery cold, you can keep your gloves on and still use the touch screen. Tested and it works!Bottom line: for under $100 you get a device functionally comparable to a 64Gb iPod that can also make calls and access high-speed LTE data. And no monthly commitment required.UPDATE: After about one month of usage I'd like to add that the quality of the DSP (digital sound processor) put into it by Nokia is terrific!!! It is clear, more or less powerful to drive common cans (headphones), and has crisp trebles and substantial lows.Surprisingly plugging in my Fiio headphone amplifier does very little to improve on the great base line this phone has.

(For some, this might be a deal breaker)I'm being too picky about the camera, I know.I'm just spoiled by the camera on my old Galaxy S3.In conclusion:I would recommend this phone to anyone wanting a smartphone with a user friendly operating system, low price point, and great built in apps/features.",2014年6月30日 在美国审核

Great money saver. Better than they say,"We had a basic GoPhone that died and needed a replacement. When we set the phone up it asked for a calling plan as expected. 250 minutes for $25 a month minimum.

But on top of that for $66 a year we are replacing out home land line. We have WiFi and the phone will connect to any WiFi. Add Skype and you have a cordless home phone replacement. Load the Skype app and get a Skype Number for $5 a month or a on time payment of $30 a year. Add Skype unlimited calling for $2.99 a month and for under $66 a year we have a home phone.

Excellent value for an entry-level Windows Phone,"I purchased this from Amazon so that I could use it with H2O Wireless (an AT&amp;T reseller).I am pleased to say that this phone works fine on H2O, no unlocking necessary.I had to order an H2O micro SIM, which I purchased on Amazon also (for like 10 cents).Activated the SIM online on H2O's website, added $10 and ten minutes later, BOOM!I'm making calls.(I did not set up data with H2O, but it is possible to change the data settings in the phone to use their data service also, for me this is basically a poor-man's iPod that happens to be able to make phone calls... I'm on Wifi 90% of my day.)Likes:1. Windows Phone interface is snappy. Sometimes you get ""Loading..."" when switching to an app, but for the most part, works real slick.I like that you can change up the Home screen with whatever you want.2. Nokia Drive maps (GPS) works great once you install your SIM card. (Yes the maps work with my H2O SIM :)3. Does everything I need it to, which is Music / Podcasts, very light email / Twitter checking, Kindle app, GPS. Oh, and calls!4. Able to expand the storage with micro SD. My music, photos, maps are on the 32GB SD that I also purchased separately.5. Integrated really nicely with my Gmail account. Once I had that set, my calendars and mail sync'ed right up. Nice.6. Reasonably lightweight.7. Pretty good camera for stills &amp; videos (no flash, but hey this is just a phone)Dislikes:1. So far it seems like I do need to charge this phone every night. It's my first smartphone, so I don't know if it's normal. As long as I remember, it's fine.2. Windows Phone OS does take up a lot of room (over 2GB). Apps need to be stored on the phone's memory, not the SD card. So far not a problem for me, but if you're an app junkie you might want to think about that. Except...3.

Amazing value,"I can't possibly believe that Nokia is making any money off this phone because it seems to be an impossibly good value. Either that or every other phone is killing our wallets. In this tiny package, you get a fully functional windows phone 8 that performs just as well as it's big brother phones...for a fraction of the price. I'll admit to a owning a couple of these because I got tired of the kids asking to use mine so I got one for them, put it airplane mode and never activated it. Now it's functionally a $50 iPod Touch with expandable memory. Great little device that I can't recommend enough.",2014年1月21日 在美国审核
FANTASTIC PHONES!!!,"My wife and I wanted to come into the 21st century and get smart phones. We didn't want to spend the money on I-phones and I preferred the Windows interface. These are GREAT!! The work well with Straight Talk, very affordable and the app list available is growing. Nothing bad to say at all. If you're at all interested in Windows 8 phones and don't want to spend a mint, this is your next phone! Only things missing are camera flash and front camera. If you can live without these features and want AT&amp;T or Straight Talk for service, GET THIS PHONE!!!",2014年3月16日 在美国审核
"Amazing phone for the price, far better than Lumia 900","This is not the be all end all cell phone.It will not make your jaw hit the floor in amazement.It is missing a few features that irritate me, like a flash for the camera (that means no flashlight apps) and no visual voicemail.It is still a solid, reliable phone with good connectivity and a solid interface.I bought this to replace my broken Lumia 900.I broke that glitchy piece of flaming garbage in aggravation by throwing it across the room. Whenever I was in an app, game or making a call, the bottom buttons (back, home, bing) would randomly trigger without being pressed.That was kind of a problem, especially when speech recognition wanted to come on in the middle of a call.On a particularly bad day, I got fed up and threw it across the room. That was the best thing I ever did, because this phone is MUCH better.Besides not having those glitches, it is also a windows 8 phone, an upgrade my Lumia 900 never got.It also has expandable memory, an option not offered on the Lumia 900.Oh, and did I mention that when I ordered this one a couple of months ago, it was $50 LESS than the Lumia 900?Nokia should be ashamed of themselves for making that junk, and issue us all refunds.Bottom line, buy this stable, cheap smart phone, and tell them to keep their buggy expensive junk.Or buy an android from samsung.I probably will after this one dies and my contract runs out.",2013年10月2日 在美国审核

excellent phone for the price,For those looking for a windows phone this is an excellent choice for the price. While the app selection is limited there is still a lot to choose from so I do not think that this is a big distraction for the casual user. The battery life is phenomenal. I can get 2+ days on a charge.

great value for $20 or even $30,"Phone works well and is more than adequate for a backup phone, which is why I purchased it at $20 sale price. Windows store is severely limited in terms of apps when compared to the Google Play store or even the Apple store. Touch screen is responsive and menu system works smoothly, although is not quite as functional as my Galaxy s4. Downloading and updating apps, even over wifi, was very slow. Overall, great value for $20 or even $30, although don't expect it to compete with the more powerful smart phones, and I will hesitate to buy a Windows phone in the future as a primary phone due to the limitations the system has.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2015"

Great wifi audio player and GPS.,"My 8Gb second generation iPod touch has served me well, it's pretty dinged up but still chugging along, but I didn't want to wait before it died so I decided to look into a replacement. I looked at the SanDisk players and iPods, which really are your only options if you want to go with something not discontinued or of suspicious quality. I really didn't care for the look of the SanDisks and the iPods were overpriced, then I came upon this at under 30 dollars, good reviews, comes with onboard 8gb of storage and micro-sd card expansion. I was sold. I stuck a 16Gb card in and never looked back. I have not inserted the SIM card as I don't need a phone just an audio player. It also has a GPS that works very well with the included ""Here Maps"" and ""Here Drive+"" apps, be sure to download the appropriate maps for offline use if you don't plan on using the SIM and getting a data plan.","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2015"

Great non-murderous device.,"For the price you can't really beat this phone. I've used android phones which on paper should be better than this and they can't compare to the usability that i've gotten from this phone. There's very few apps that I used on Android that aren't available on windows phone and i think the ones that are on windows phone just look nicer albeit thats more of a personal opinion sort of thing i guess. The phone is very easy to use although it does not have the same amount of customizability that you may come to expect after using an android phone but instead will probably be more comparable to an iPhone (at least based on my experience) the nice thing about this though is that everything just seems to work better together. The camera is pretty good albeit i'm sure flagship phones would do better. It performed better than my HTC G2 though which was what I was aiming for so i'm pretty satisfied. It has a good build quality and i've dropped it a few times without it exploding which is a plus. In addition it has yet gain sentience and try to kill me in my sleep...yet.

... for three months and overall I am surprised and pleased on the outcome of buying and using this phone,"I've had the Lumina 520 for three months and overall I am surprised and pleased on the outcome of buying and using this phone. Other than the usual learning curve for a new device it works pretty well. In fact it does everything and functions just like my iphones did and I think I will keep this phone after I am eligible for a new iphone upgrade in a few months from now. Email, text, photos and apps.I paid only $48 plus $4 tax on Amazon. I called AT&amp;T and they activated the Go Phone SIM card for my regular post paid plan. At $50 and no contract with AT&amp;T I have new options: 1. I have a fully functioning smart phone with no contract, 2. I don't need to purchase phone insurance because it's a low cost replacement 3.Replacing it doesn't cost $600 for a new iphone during my phone contract 4. I don't need a case. It's so light compared to the clunky iphone - feels like comparing oz's to lb's. I've dropped it three times and it came apart like one of those crash toys that falls apart and dissipates the shock - three pieces - front, back and battery.5. I will no longer be perpetually contracted to AT&amp;T from phone upgrades. 6. Activating the phone with AT&amp;T is free vs upgrading, paying $35 activation fee or taking the time to call AT&amp;T to waive the upgrade fee. 7. The phone itself is not the object of my affection but rather a tool to do the things that I need done and this phone well does what I need.By the way they say when you don't use the iphone you don't have as many available apps. It's true and in addition to that, the Windows apps that are available may be the same app but the features of the app are greatly reduced.

Awesome budget phone.,"Long story short, I water damaged my iPhone. Since I'm not eligible for an upgrade yet and I wasn't willing to spend the $700+ to replace the iPhone, i opted for an alternative. Since I am already an ATT customer and this being a Locked ATT GoPhone, I just inserted my SIM card in and worked. I did buy a nano SIM to MicroSIM adapter since iPhones use Nano sim and this phone only takes MicroSIM.Since its a budget smartphone, it lacks many of the premium features that the iPhone or other premium phones have such as a fast processor, high quality display, multiple sensors, better quality camera with flash, front facing camera, noise cancelling microphone, LTE etc. etc.What I love is that its light, screen is bright enough and color is decent, resolution is adequate, touch response is good and the processor snappy enough for the average app. May not be fast enough for some graphic intensive game but I don't play games on my phone so no issues there. With this phone, I'm able to do the things I need to do which is, email, facebook, twitter, internet, call messaging and music. Even though its not an LTE phone, 4G is fast enough. This is enough to keep me satisfied until I my contract allows me for an upgrade with subsidized pricing.Battery life is good. GPS. Call quality is decent. The volume on the earpiece is loud enough, speaker phone is adequate and WIndows8 is easy to navigate. 8GB internal memory and expandable via MicroSD card. Good music playback as well.WIndows8 is pretty good. What I don't like it's that many of the apps I had on iOS, they are not available for Win8 which is why I gave this phone a 4 out of 5.Overall, this smart phone has enough features and I was actually impressed with it. The more I use it, the more i like it but I still do miss my iPhone. For a phone less than $100, I think its great. Biggest draw back is the lack of apps from MicroSoft because of WIndows 8 but the OS if very nice. The live tile is nice and navigation and customization is easy.",2014年1月29日 在美国审核

This was the best 50 dollars I have ever spent. Period.,"I am generally a power user when it comes to smartphones. My last phone before this, an LG Optimus G Pro, featured a 2.3GHz quad core, 2GB of ram and a 5.5 inch 1080p display. Obviously, the Lumia 520 doesn’t come close, but one thing I quickly realized as an Android user is that Windows Phone OS doesn’t require nearly as much processing power as Android does, so things run very smoothly even with a 1.0GHz dual core processor and 512MB of RAM. On top of that, the 4” 800x480 pixel IPS display is actually very sharp, for any class of device.The operating system here is actually vastly improved and the lack of apps is actually a bit overblown. Windows’s tiled Metro UI is unique and easy to use. Its the perfect hybrid of Android’s widget system and Apple no-widget system. Live tiles are useful and with the ability to change the system’s theme color with just a few touches, you can personalize your phone to your liking without much work.The Windows 8.1 update also adds a lot of great features here. There is a new notification center like Android and iOS. You have access to quick settings here like Bluetooth, Wifi, among others, but thankfully its not as cluttered as some Android phone’s notification centers. 8.1 also adds Cortana, which is kind of like Google Now and Siri, but I would say both Siri and Google Now are better options over Cortana, although Cortana is usable, but could improve.One of the features that I really like with the 8.1 update is that I can double tap to wake the screen. Its a feature available on many high end Android devices and it was nice to see on such a cheap device like the Lumia 520. Another great feature is that ID3 tags are stream to all bluetooth devices. When I have my Android phone paired up with my car, the track information does not show up in the car’s infotainment system, but with the Lumia 520 paired up, it does. It ends up being a huge convenience.Then there is the added benefits of this device, which simply outweigh anything offered by any of the Android vendors or Apple. The phone comes prepackaged with HERE Maps and Drive. Both offer offline maps mode, which means you can use the maps even without any kind of data signal. Navigation software like this costs easily 20 bucks or more on the other two platforms. There is also Nokia’s MixRadio, which offers ad-free streaming and aparently also offline music downloads; all for free. Spotify costs 10 bucks a month for the same features. I haven’t used MixRadio because I use Spotify on my other devices so its more convenient for me, but that is still a huge value for anyone.There are, however, a few downsides for the phone. The 5.0MP camera is very average in well-lit conditions, which is expected at this price range. Since there is no flash here, its virtually unseable in the dark. THere is also no front facing camera. Personally, I would’ve liked to see Nokia include a front-facing camera instead of a cheap back camera because it would’ve allowed users to use Skype and other video calling apps instead.Aside from that, the battery life could be a little better and I wish some of the apps functioned better. For example, Facebook vibrates your phone three times each time a notification appears. If you have both the Facebook Messenger and the original app downloaded and someone messages you, then you will get six (!) vibrates per message, which is beyond annoying.Overall, though, this phone is great. I plan on getting an Android phone later on, but I will keep this one around. Its a great backup phone at worst and a perfect companion for a lot of people who don’t need any of the fancy apps available on Android or Apple. I have been using mine for about 6 months and I have also bought both my dad and grandma one each. None of the three of us have any complaints about them!",2014年7月26日 在美国审核

By far best off contract value.,"I already have a newer phone and only bought this because it was $40 and I don't have a backup phone. When I received the 520, I threw my micro sim in it to test it out...and didn't switch back for 3 days. Bear in mind, my daily driver is a Nexus 5, so the fact that I didn't get bored or need to switch back for utility was pretty impressive.Pro's:Compact 4"" screen, think iPhone 5 or the old Atrix 4g, very good size and pocket-able.Smooth UI, very little lag. 1ghz dual core and 512mb ram seem to work well.MicroSD card slot and Removeable battery. Most new phones don't have this.Nokia Drive gps lets you download maps and use GPS completely offline.Camera is great. Honestly probably the best camera on a &lt;$150 phone, maybe even up to $200+.Con's:Windows 8 still lacking in Apps, not the phones fault.Battery is kind of small, but if you use normal/sparingly it will last more than a day (Auto-bright helps a LOT).The removable back comes off easier than i'd like.No flash/light. Knew this buying it, and would probably increase price, so not taking a star off. Just turn the brightness up and flip the phone around if you need light.For $40-70 you really can't beat this.

Best Bargain I've Found in Many a Year,"I got this for $20 when it was the Deal of the Day.What a steal!I haven't used it much as a cell phone, but more like an IPod and GPS navigation system.It has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a GPS receiver.With or without a SIM card inserted, and with Wi-Fi turned off, you can still use it like a GPS navigator once you download the free maps for the states you're interested in.The turn-by-turn verbal guidance works great.

Best non-contract phone. All the smart phone features for just $30. Works with AT &amp; T.,"This is a great phone to replace a broken older iPhone or if you don't want a contract.

Upgrade from iPhone3gs on Straight Talk,"I am writing this after having an iPhone 3gs on Straight Talk for the last year.We can't afford the latest and greatest in phones, and we don't really need to.We don't require a lot of bells and whistles, I just like to be able to get on facebook, and find info on Google, prices on amazon, etc while I'm out and about.This phone does just that, and FAST!!!The 4G is faster than my wifi (we live in the middle of nowhere with super slow internet!), so I use the 4G most of the time, even at home.There are only a couple of things that I am not a fan of, and haven't been able to figure out.-the home button vibrates each time you push it....I can't figure out how to turn this off.-the app store is severely limited (but I'm hoping that stories about being able to get google play in 2015 are true!)other than this, my husband (touchscreen phone novice) both LOVE these phones.They are simple to use, and serve our needs.We are both using the phones on Straight Talk, you have to buy the AT&amp;T SIM cards from Straight Talk for these phones to work.It's been 3 months since we've had these phones.I have since upgraded to a BLU android based phone, and my husband's phone just locked up on him and he can't do anything with it.Also the screen cracked.I would avoid these at all costs!",2014年12月28日 在美国审核

Great Device!,"The Nokia Lumia 520 is a great device, and even better at the price point Amazon is offering it at.In the past I've used iOS and Android, and this was my first experience with Windows Phone as an OS. It is every bit as capable as the other two, and infact is a very easy to use and snappy mobile device OS. If the App ecosystem worries you, do know it is growing everyday. I think they only real concern should be if you absolutely rely on an app that is not currently available on the OS.Nokia makes a very solid phone, I've dropped this phone quite a few times (because at this price point I'm less careful than I was with my iPhone and Nexus 4) and it has held up very well. There are a few apps that can lag a bit, but one must remember that this is an entry level phone for WP. Nokia's apps, especially the camera, HERE Maps, and Nokia Music are all fantastic, and don't cost you a penny. If you're worried about data, the maps you'll use in HERE Maps are all downloadable, which means your Turn-by-turn GPS is snappy because it isn't downloading the map as you go.As for service I'm using the Lumia 520 on Straight Talk's network, using one of thier AT&amp;T SIMs, and am having no issues. The phone is able to make calls, texts, and use MMS and Data.All in all, if you set your expectations correctly for the phone (don't buy it thinking it is a flagship device, because it just isn't) then you'll likely be very happy with your purchase.

Eh.  Not a fan of Windows OS and the phone was faulty.... :(,"Received the phone quickly.... but here were my issues:1.ServiceATT website and store both claimed I could use this phone with UNLIMITED text/video/pix with the $25 a month phone package.When I tried to send a pix message it said it couldn't go through.Apparently, while I asked the rep in the store AND checked the website for ""fine print"" and had zero indication it wasn't possible... you can NOT use this phone to send pix/video messages unless you pay the extra for a data plan.They lied to my face, and in print both in the store and online.YOU CAN NOT USE THE $25 PLAN WITH THIS PHONE UNLESS YOU PAY FOR EXTRA DATA USAGE.2.PhoneWhen I bought the phone, I also bought the case and screen protector shields and the phone plan.So it took me a couple days to notice, but when I did NOT have the case on, and would set it down it would turn off.After a week or two it stopped charging completely.I'm guessing there was an issue with the battery and the phone not connecting right...?Not sure, but Amazon was fantastic and refunded my money before I even sent it back.I also didn't love the windows 8 system.The apps were limited, and there are NO words to describe what is pre-loaded.You end up having to guess based on pictures, and then click things until you remember.At least with other OS they have a picture and a word, or the picture is something you are fairly familiar with (chrome, etc).I just didn't love having to search through things repeatedly to try to find something instead of having a simple description.Ended up switching to Virgin Mobile with the AWE.So far I've enjoyed it.It's been a great starter smart phone and has literally thousands of apps, instead of the couple hundred this one has available.Also, 2 weeks, no issues.I may have had a bum phone, I'm not sure.But if you go with this, just make sure you get a really good case (I have one if anyone wants it!!!!) just in case its a product thing and not a fluke with my phone.",2014年9月25日 在美国审核

Poor Keyboard and Touch Screen,"I purchased this phone 7 months ago to replace my previous phone which experienced a hardware failure. For a price of around $50, I wasn't expecting this phone to be loaded by any means. The camera isn't great; it has a small amount of RAM compared to today's phones, etc. Of course, these things are to be expected with low end phones, so my rating is not influenced by these factors.However, there are two things I can barely stand with this phone, and they are the most important features: The keyboard and the touch screen! I don't know what it is, but something about this keyboard makes it incredibly difficult for me to type messages properly. Even when typing slowly, I constantly hit the wrong keys or touch the home screen button. Something about the layout of the keys feels awkward, and even after 7 months I’ve never been able to adjust. I thought maybe it was because the screen is smaller than my last phone, but when I use my iPod which is the same size as this, I can type messages with very little errors both quickly and easily.In addition, there are frequently small delays when sending messages back to back. This is likely due to the small amount of RAM. For instance, let’s say I send a text to someone. Immediately after the first text, I begin to type my next message. Since there is a small delay, some of the words I’ve just typed either do not register with the phone, or only bits and pieces register. This means my message turns into a display of garbage characters which requires me to completely re-type the message. Obviously this can be prevented by either slowing down or including everything I can in one message, but in the middle of a conversation it’s difficult to slow down.Now my second issue, the touch screen. This phone does not do well when browsing the internet. When attempting to zoom in, the phone frequently thinks I’ve clicked on links embedded in the web page. Sometimes when I actually do try to click on a link, the phone zooms out. When I’m trying to slowly move across the page (like when reading an article) the phone constantly thinks I’ve swiped the command for going to the previous page, even with me moving across the screen at a slow rate. I could understand it if I were trying to quickly swipe the screen, but I’m not. For anyone wondering, I’ve encountered these issues using both Internet Explorer (the default browser) and UC Browser (currently the #1 web browser in Windows Store). I also do not have a screen protector on my phone.This phone seems like it would be a great value for light users who don’t browse the internet often and need a smart phone just to have a smart phone. For heavier users, I can’t recommend it due to my poor experience with the keyboard and touch screen. They seem like easy things to overcome, but they’ve led to a lot of frustration and wasted time for me.",2014年7月18日 在美国审核

It comes with a Micro SIM card and GoPhone activation kit in the box.It performs great! I've owned a Lumia 920, HTC 8x, Lumia 822, and a few older WP7 devices. This, just like any other Windows Phone, feels smooth and fluid throughout. Sometimes when a larger operation (filtering a photo, opening a big app) takes place, you will notice a ""Resuming..."" screen for a split second. Otherwise, it's every bit as smooth as any other Windows Phone. You can't really say that about an Android device at this price point",2014年3月14日 在美国审核
"Inexpensive, Functional.","It's not like I'm the source to come to when you have a question about a good smart-phone but I really like my Nokia Lumia 520. It's my first after my daughter bought a high end Nokia Lumia and I got to see it's features. I decided that I wasn't about to spend what she did for hers and found this little gem. Some other relatives and friends have much more expensive phones and have more problems with them then I'd ever care to have. I wanted a phone that would simply connect me to everyone via call or text message and possibly to the world around me and this phone does just that. Lots of free apps, lots of games that are pertinent to me and an easy way to keep track of my usage. Simply dial *3282# and you have your data usage anytime you want it. Only thing about this phone that's a negative to me is that the camera is lacking. No flash and I'm, probably like the rest of you a photo nut!A lot of lighting fixes that though. It's a pre-paid phone so you have to bring it to your nearest AT&amp;T outlet to have it set up but they do a good job. It gets 4 stars from me only because of the camera and that's probably not fair because I own good cameras. Oh yeah, one more thing, not a lot of space. You have to delete some apps to make room for more important ones.",2014年1月29日 在美国审核
Blown away by this phone,"Lookit, I'm a PC. And I'm an Android. I actually own a Galaxy S3 (my regular phone on Verizon) AND an iPhone 4 (spare/toy on T-Mobile). So naturally I was curious about ""this Windows Phone thing"". I saw a killer deal on Amazon, so I went for it because it's a GoPhone (AT&amp;T prepaid). Well I haven't stopped fooling around with it since I opened it up last night. Beautiful display, slippery smooth OS, everything ""just works"" like it should. Even Bluetooth was super easy- connected to my Motorola S9 Rokr heaset without even a PIN request (what a pain THAT is). WiFi works fine so I don't have to kill my minutes. It wasn't difficult at all to get used to the Win8 Metro interface (I have Win8.1 on a laptop and do NOT like it there). Yes, apps are somewhat limited but I was surprised to find Waze, Splashtop and SoundHound available. There's a VNC viewer available also. In conclusion, it's not perfect but it's awfully good if you want to get your feet wet in the smartphone arena or just want a toy to play with. I'm thinking my next Verizon phoneupgrade might just be Windows. GO!",2014年2月7日 在美国审核
Best Overall Value,"Best price for an ATT new smart phone. Good looking easy to use with micro SIM (mindful, I had to cut mine).

perfect for your pc.,"The Lumia 520 is an entry level device into a whole new smartphone experience being windows. The real kicker is of course the price, and I must say it's well worth the money. If you're a pc user the 520 is a great companion to your Windows 8 or 7 PC, documents, pictures, videos are sent to Microsoft's Sky Drive without effort at all and are on your PC almost as soon as you take a picture or save a document. There is no need to sync you PC to your phone to complete this task so the worry with USB cables is all but over. Syncing your music is easy I would suggest picking out a SD card 16GB or larger the Phone supports up to 64GB. Once you have installed your card download the software to your windows 8 PC free from the store or stream it from X Box Music either way is fast and easy. The screen is bright and clear even in sunlight and does work to touch even with gloves on. Call's a crisp and very clear both over Bluetooth and the handset. The browser is fluid and opens quickly as expected from a 4G device pinch zoom and scroll work very well. It's a smaller Phone very light weight and slim. I find it slick and hard to hold but the device does feel built well and sturdy and slides easily into a pocket. Battery life is just ok I was able to get a normal 10 hour day with ease. Here drive is a standalone GPS navigation app built into Nokia Devices it even works when you have no cell service by downloading maps and storing them on the phone. The app is clear easy to use and so far exact with directions and guidance. Over all it's a great phone for the money the windows store is still growing and more apps seem to show up every day. After looking for many months and even thinking of switching back to apple we thought we would give a windows phone a try. Were so glad we did and are looking forward to upgrading to a device along the Nokia line very soon. Not this this phone is bad it is very well priced and works well above the standard of any entry level android or even I phone 4. The phone is smart fast and a joy to use. As always Amazon sent the packageon time without any trouble and does sell a line of cases to help make your phone yours.Update to windows 8.1If your using this phons it is ready to update to windows 8.1 with cortana before you do it depending on the memory left you may want to back up the device then reset it. Once you do run the up date and follow the instructions. Once you've updated to 8.1 the phone will automatically restore all your apps and data. The update is well worth it and changes many things on the device. The up date is large so download it over a wifi connection. You will get the new lumia cyan and then windows 8.1 when you run the update software,it takes up to 8 hours for apps like games and xbox to update but you will be able to use the phone in less than an hour. The windows 8.1 experience is much improved over the current os and makes this phone an better purchase.",2014年1月1日 在美国审核

"Not a top drawer phone, but an epic value","As a smartphone, this is pretty lame by today's standards. The screen is so-so, both in brightness and resolution; the construction, while decent, is not fondle worthy; battery life is rotten and poorly managed by the OS; and among the three main phone operating systems, Window Phone is definitely the weak sister, both in terms of number of apps available and general usability. It would be hard to recommend this phone if you had to take a two year contract to get it.But for no contract and $70? Incredible. A steal. It is cheaper than a lot of mp3 players. And a hell of a lot better. You get a camera, GPS, web browser, internet radio, FM radio, smartphone apps (just don't expect a lot of games), full media player, including video. You even get a micro-sd slot, so you can turn an 8 gb phone into a 40 gb phone for about $15 dollars extra.And, of course, it is also a very cheap phone, if you add minutes to it. $25 a month provides basic service, a pretty good deal.I will say that the battery issues are pretty annoying. If you don't turn it completely off, the 520 will run down its battery in about 48 hours, even if you don't use it. Even so, this is a great value.",2013年12月14日 在美国审核
Surprising Performance!,"I needed a replacement phone for a Galaxy S3 phone where the screen had cracked and I didn't want to invest in buying a full-priced phone since I was still within my contract.Opening the phone, placing the micro-SIM (pay attention to the picture symbol that tells you which direction it goes in), and going to a fully usable phone, took about 5 to 10 minutes.Coming from an Android/Galaxy phone, was a big change. As with any transition, there's always pro's and con's, however given the price/value of the phone, I'm not disappointed because I think it was the best choice I could of made.Remember I'm coming from a Galaxy S3/Android phone, so my opinions are based on that:Pro's- Shipped with the latest version of Windows Mobile 8.0.10327 (GDR2) that supports Amber alerts- Display screen was better than expected. I was expecting a display that was going to be subpar. Of course, it isn't as crisp as an OLED based display but good enough!- Responsiveness - I was expecting a ""slow experience"" but was surprised at the performance. It handled the scrolls and display pretty well- Sound - pretty good and on-par with my previous phones- Keyboard - good word prediction- Apps - Contrary to what I've heard, most of the apps that a business user needs, is there. Sure, the app market doesn't have the breath of games etc, but for what a business user needs, it's good enough.- Nokia Radio - Impressive.. I was able to store off-line radio stations. NICE!!!Con's- Battery : I'm not sure of the battery. I was expecting better performance compared to the S3 but so far it looks to be the same from a perspective of percent usage throughout the day. I'm still tweaking the performance, so I'll see.- Configurability of email sync options; doesn't support the ability to setup regular versus off-hours schedule. I would of thought that this would be supported but perhaps it doesn't because this is the lower-end version of the Nokia.- Keyboard - I miss Swype. It was fast to just draw the words that type, however I think it will be just a learning curve- Browser - Internet Explorer doesn't support the ability to remember/save login info on a web form.- Notification bar - I wish the battery and wireless indicator has the option to be persistent all the time. Right now, I have to swype it down. However, I believe the proper way is to have tiles setup to show this info.- Camera Quality - I wasn't prepared for how poor quality the megapixels was going to be.. coming from an 8 megapixel down to a 5 megapixel, was surprisingly very noticeable.Anyway, the Lumia 520 isn't an exact replacement for a Galaxy S3, but it's good enough!

You get what you pay for. Can't ask for much for $30.,"This Windows Phone is not a bad choice for a test drive at Windows Phones. The system is pretty slick, and smooth running. Recognized the SDHC card I installed immediately. Set it up in about 5 min. It's got a pretty nice variety of apps for Windows and has a simple app storage system. Only detail I disliked completely, is how complicated it has been to simply connect this phone and add music to the SD card. It has been hell. I had to look for answer everywhere before I stumbled upon the fact that you have to install a Windows Phone management app for Windows 8 (which one would think would sync perfectly with the phone). And even then, the phone still has to go through some manual driver updating to be able to be found on the app. It works in the end, but the process is WAY to complicated, definitely not plug-and-play material.

To Apple enthusiasts:,"I bought this phone as a replacement for an iPod touch 5th generation. It can be used wifi-only, with no smartphone plan. It has the same hardware performance (ram &amp; processor speed), similar rear camera, and a decent, though lesser resolution LCD. The touch sensitivity is spot on. In addition, it has a removable (and therefore replaceable) battery, and expandable storage space via micro SD card. You can also directly access music (and any other) folders with your computer, eliminating the need for iTunes ""syncing"" B.S.The battery lasts longer, and Microsoft provides the same basic app selection as Apple. Not to mention this phone will not likely become outdated and unusable after only TWO YEARS, as Apple products do (by design). Like Siri? Microsoft's equivalent, Cortana, is quite frankly smarter, more useful, and more ""human.""The only faults I can give to this phone are lack of a forward-facing camera, and the wifi connection seems a bit slower at times. Understandable, given that it is intended as a smartphone, not a wifi device. It is still entirely usable.This phone is 4 times better, and 4 times CHEAPER than an iPod 5 for the same purpose.-A brutally honest review from a formerly Apple-brainwashed customer.",2014年9月23日 在美国审核

Excellent phone,"UPDATE 12/22/14: Just called AT&amp;T support in person to make a change to my Go Phone account. I asked again if the 10 cents/minute plan works with their smart phones. This time I got an emphatic yes, it does work. They normally say no because most people want data plans and web browsing when they buy a smart phone. But for those who want a smart phone with just a simple pay-as-you-go plan, it works fine for phone calls and messaging.Please be aware that AT&amp;T does not support smart phones (this phone) with pay-as-you-go plans, such as 10 cents / minute. Only their basic phones are intended to be used for those plans. You're supposed to buy a monthly usage plan with this phone.Otherwise it's an excellent deal for an excellent phone. It could be used in your wifi network for internet browsing without any plan like a small tablet.

"Reliable short-term phone, horrible app selection","The phone itself is pretty good initially. When I first got the phone, I was pleasantly surprised with how light and reliable it was. The thing I liked most about the phone when I first got it was the long battery life and how quickly it charged. Very recently (I got the phone in January of 2014), however, I've noticed that while the battery life is only slightly down from where it was initially, it takes the phone several hours to recharge the battery now. I've also recently had some issues with texting. My biggest complaint about the phone has nothing to do with the phone itself but I think anyone considering it should be aware of this: the selection of apps for windows phones is TERRIBLE. If you find your friends playing a new, slick app on their Android or Apple phones, you are probably out of luck if you look through the Windows app store hoping to get it for yourself. The deteriorating battery situation was a concern but honestly, the straw that broke the camel's back for me is that I wouldn't be able to manage my fantasy football team from my phone for the upcoming season.

"Nokia 520/521 is a great WP8 starter phone, difference will be in coverage and prepaid plans","The Nokia 520 and its T-Mobile equivalent Nokia 521 are great starter phones to get people into the Windows Phone ecosystem.The difference comes down to the initial price difference (right now the 520 is $10 cheaper than the 521 on Amazon), coverage, and the no-contract, prepaid plans.Be sure to check the AT&amp;T (and T-Mobile sites for the 521) for prepaid plans.For me, the biggest difference is in the data plan.AT&amp;T GoPhone charges extra for data use overages while T-Mobile prepaid will throttle your data speed on the overage but doesn't charge extra for the overage.Also, the 520 doesn't have the Data Sense app which is comes with Windows Phone 8 devices sold by other carriers.AT&amp;T replaces Data Sense with its own data use monitoring app.Of course, if you use the 520 as a wi-fi only device (as another reviewer suggested), additional charges for data overages shouldn't be a problem.",2013年12月5日 在美国审核

Best smart phone value for Consumer Cellular users,"As so many others have stated, this may be the best smart phone for the money.Our family is Apple centric when it comes to our desktop computers and we have several generations of iPads in the house.So we are comfortable with IOS and appreciate the wealth of educational apps available for our home school program and for for our entertainment. It would seem logical that we would gravitate to the iPhone but given our limited phone usage, but it didn't make sense to make the required investment.The Nokia 520 provides all the functionality we need and for $59, it was an incredible bargain.We simply inserted the Consumer Cellular micro SIM card, called CC to register the device's IEMI, entered the apn and mms apn settings, rebooted the phone and we were connected.I bought the phone for my wife and she finds it very easy to use.I had previously purchased a Nokia 920 for my own use, but I could be happy with a 520.I especially appreciate that it has a user replaceable battery that will extend the useful life of the phone.We don't need an unlimited data plan as we'll connect with wifi at home for browsing or downloads.Likewise, the 8GB phone memory is not an issue because we will only install a few essential apps.The Windows Phone 8 OS is well sorted out, attractive,easy to use and updated with useful features.It would be great if Microsoft, Nokia or a third party created an app to sync iCal and Apple Contacts directly and avoid Google, but for now that doesn't seem to be in the cards.Here are the pluses:1.Convenient size2.Acceptable camera for snaps (has autofocus but no flash).3.Acceptable speaker volume, sound quality okay4.Frequent W8 updates5.Replaceable battery and back cover colors6.Great Nokia Here maps and free voice aided navigation off line7.Good screen for the price . . . we aren't watching HD movies on the phone8.Micro SD slot for up to 64GB storage for photos and music9.Bluetooth connections are easy to connect and stableThe minuses:1.No flash, but most LED flash provides mediocre results at best2.No front facing camera, but we don't do selfies3.512MB of RAM may be limited for some apps, but none we need or want4.8GB memory limits the number of apps that can be loaded, but is enough for our needs",2013年12月11日 在美国审核

Great off contract phone,"For folks who are locked in a contract and do not want to fork over hundreds of dollar for a new phone, then this phone is for you!!It is not as sexy or pretty like the iPhone, but it gets the job done. Actually, the Nokia voice quality is better than the iPhone. The app store is severely lacking and Yahoo mail retrieval can be spotty at times. Please remember tha phone will only work for AT&amp;T. The phone was activated with my lost number in less than 10 minutes at the local store. Will convert this phone to a media player upon my next upgrade.",2015年1月16日 在美国审核
Really great $40 smart phone,"Really great $40 smart phone. Works without data plan... just wifi. You may want to replace the standard apps that came with it for better functioning ones like ""radio."" It deleted my contacts in the first 3 days. I'm a mac person... so if you need help, Nokia, Microsoft and ATT bounces you around... so figuring things out on the phone is in your hands. I like the way it feels in my hand... touch screen is a little ify.UPDATE: 1 year later... still going strong. Does everything I need it to do. Maps doesn't function fast enough when I driving (it's quick, but not enough for me personally,) so I replaced it with Gmaps. The processor is staring to show some age... slow when it comes to gaming, which I seldom use anyway. It really shines when I don't have wifi... it has a variety of apps that doesn't need wifi to entertain.",2015年1月3日 在美国审核

"Good Phone, but...","I don't like the Windows OS. If you're coming to this phone from an Android phone, expect to be unhappy. The phone itself is great; fast, smooth operation of the OS. However, there are several things lacking:1. The apps suck! There aren't that many out there (vs Android or Apple), and a good bit of the ones that are there are 3rd party and don't work or aren't supported after the build. The interface for Gmail is terrible! No way to filter out the spam, so I now get a notification for each email that comes in, and I have to delete them manually.2. Why cheap out on the sound/notification profiles? There are none on this phone, so you have to trust a 3rd party app (good luck) or go into the settings to manually change and turn off the ringer and notification tones when you need it to be silent. And if you don't want it to wake you up in the middle of the night, you'd better do it because the phone won't charge without the OS running, which means even if you turn it off before you plug it in, it reboots itself.The phone itself is great, just wish it came with an Android OS instead of Windows.",2014年4月23日 在美国审核

Pros and Cons,"For a windows phone with 4 gig's internal the price is low, so more money in your pocket. The battery last me about 2 days with moderate usage. I used the phone with straight talk, because their deal with the 3 gig's of data. Microsoft needs to work on their app store,truth be told. I read most of the reviews that people have wrote about the apps and let's just say that I don't have any downloaded because of too many bugs, and not much to chose from. As far as signal goes, if i use the code and switch to 2G I get alright service, 3G N/A (everytime I try to get it to 3G it pushes to 4G), 4G it works sometimes when I am home but works best when I am in the city. Now if the signal and app market was better and more developed, i would use it more",2015年1月23日 在美国审核
