A lengthy review of a refurbished galaxy note 9,"I did a lot of research before buying a phone, and was quite worried that I would get ripped off from purchasing one online. Additionally, I've had poor luck with several of Amazon's third party retailers. With this in mind, I was very skeptical about potential false reviews, false advertising, or a damaged product. However, for the price it was the best deal I could find on a galaxy note 9 outside of a carrier plan. So, after seeing that the item was returnable I gave it a shot. Luckily, it worked. I recieved a fully unlocked note 9 with a charger and instructions on how to activate it.I will say that many of the reviews I read prior to buying insisted otherwise, and they were likely correct. If you're purchasing from Amazon, you'll probably see several similar looking deals with identical display pictures (which isn't a good sign in my book). Even if it is a prime eligible deal be careful and read through the descriptions. Look at the seller information and read the return policies on refurbished phones. It should list something about being returned within 2 weeks of the original purchase. If it does not be skeptical. Also, It should be noted that anyone can make up a business name and description on amazon, then sell used items out of their basement if they wanted, so look carefully through the seller's ""company"" reviews.Furthermore, the charger that came with my purchase was not an original Samsung charger. It was a cheaper off brand model that charged slower by comparison. The phone itself had little to no scratches. These micro scratches are small and only visible after a very close inspection on my part. The battery life on my phone has been excellent! This came as quite a nice surprise. I've used it for several months now and it keeps a charge like new. I can go two full days with mild/moderate use off one charge. ( Mild/moderate meaning not using my phone constantly throughout the day to watch movies, play games, or scroll through social media posts. I may have watched short videos for class, read emails, texts, short calls, etc.)Overall, the phone has worked quite well and continues to do so. Last thing I'll say is I highly reccomend the galaxy note 9 for the specs to cost ratio (as of 2019). Its a good phone for the value, even though phones in general are expensive. Any additional information on the phone specs and relative market comparisons would require another lengthy review, so I won't drag this on any further lol.Hopefully this helped someone and thanks for reading!",2019年7月19日 在美国审核,2

Second Time's A Charm!,"Someone wrote that when we reviewed it would be helpful to write who we purchased our phone from so other potential buyers know who to buy from and who to avoid, so I will share my experience with trying to buy a secondhand note 9.<br>I had originally purchased a note 9 from WIRELESS WAREHOUSE. The phone was ""Amazon Renewed"" so I figured it would be in better shape, but it wasn't the quality that I was expecting, especially with the amount of scratches on the screen and the worn-out S-pen.Also, although the phone was supposed to be factory unlocked, the phone was locked to Sprint so it wouldn't work correctly with my Tracfone sim. For this reason, I ended up having to send back the phone.Afterwards, I bought a 2nd note 9, this time from EDGE CELLULAR and it came in near perfect condition with the exception of two little nicks on two of the corners but other than that, the phone was flawless [although, I did pay about $50 more for this one (total $440) than the original one I bought]. One thing different about this purchase was that it came in a Samsung box with all the original accessories including some headphones.Also, the 2nd phone was truly factory unlocked, so when I put in my Tracfone sim, it worked automatically. I'm much happier with the 2nd purchase and I think I will be keeping this one as long as it remains working well. I'll give an update in about a month or so to be sure.Hope this helps y'all.UPDATE: though it's been longer than a month, I just thought I'd mention that the phone is still great even in 2020. I absolutely love this Note 9 and am glad I made the purchase. Everything still works great!</br>",2019年11月19日 在美国审核,2
Great phone,"Opted for a note 9 instead of the upcoming 10 due to budget restraints and it is by far an excellent choice. I really didn't need all the bells ND whistles of the 10.This one works excellently. It came in a white box with charger, cable, Sim tray pin. I took out my Sim and SD card from my note 8, popped them in, turned on Samsung Switch on both ND let it rip. Done in less than an hour, every single app, contact, song, password, account, keyboard, done! Calls are much clearer, louder.This was a renewed phone and it is flawless out of the box.

No WiFi calling on this model,"Love the Galaxy Note 9 but I had to return this phone because it does not have WiFi calling. It was compatible with Verizon like it advertised but apparently the model N960u1 is not compatible with WiFi calling. It was suggested that the model N960u would be compatible with WiFi calling but since I can't check it before I buy it, I won't be buying factory unlocked again. I checked the phone at the Verizon store and it does have WiFi calling and is model N960u, so maybe it is just a model problem instead of an unlocked problem. However, it was indicated by the technicians that flash firmware would have to be downloaded on unlocked phones.",2018年12月10日 在美国审核,0

Also It had Tmobile programmed in it but it is unlocked so I would assume any Sim should work...Dislikes: Phone has cosmetic damages. Minor scrapes along edges could be due to usage or previous maintenance. Screen is new however there was a very small indentation in it (No Scratches Though). ""Product is renewed so its not served in an original package with original accessories. Instead it has an off brand charger, used off brand headphones, and off brand charger base.""If you don't plan on buying a case and want a brand new phone for the look of a brand new phone I wouldn't recommend this, but if you are in need of a phone for a cheaper price, with great functionality, and plan on buying a case, I would recommend you checking this product out.",2019年11月18日 在美国审核,0
Just like new,"I know Amazon does not say which seller you bought from, so I'll say I bought my renewed Galaxy Note 9 from Re-Cell and I 1000% recommend to buy from them! I was very hesitant to buy a renewed phone, especially from Amazon where it's such a mixed bag. I'm glad to say I'm pleasantly surprised! I couldn't even tell the phone was ever used except for the fact that it was turned on in the box when I first opened it. The box itself was honestly impressive, it looked exactly like the galaxy note 9 box but with the seller's logo instead of Samsung's. I should also mention that it is listed as a Verizon unlocked phone, but came unlocked for all carriers!In terms of the phone, there were no scratches, dents or anything of the like. Everything is fully functional. The S-pen is the original Samsung one. No problems with call quality, wifi connectivity, etc. The charger isn't the original, but again looks like a replica of the original. I had a bit of an issue with getting the charger to fast charge the phone, every few minutes the screen would light up as it would stop and then start charging again. However, I have a few other fast charging adapters and cables, so this wasn't a big deal. The seller even included headphones! Nothing amazing, but enough to go above and beyond the Amazon listing.Again, I bought this phone from Re-Cell and can't verify the condition of the device you would get from another seller. But with the money back guarantee, I would recommend buying this phone and returning it if the condition is bad. You really can't beat the price.",2020年1月16日 在美国审核,2

Nice phone only a few minor problems,"**UPDATE 3-16-2020**Phone recently updated to Android 10 and it has gone south. I can charge the battery to 100% and go to bed, when I wake up 8 hours later the battery will be drained 25% or more. I found that if I leave wifi OFF it will only drain 5% overnight. So for some reason wifi now causes the battery life to shorten considerably.With only a 90 day warranty on the ""renewed"" phones, I am out of luck for repair 10 months after purchasing the phone.**ORIGINAL 4 STAR REVIEW** I bought a ""Renewed"" phone from Seller CellGuru. It arrived before the date originally quoted on the order. All i got was a phone and a charger. The battery was at 18% upon arrival so I plugged it into the included charger and went out for the night. When I returned more than 5 hours later, the battery was at 24% so I was shocked. I messaged Amazon and after a little troubleshooting, it appears the charger is defective. They gave me a credit to buy a new charger on Amazon and all is good.The screen does have VERY minor scratches which are visible only at certain angles in sunlight, so it's not 100% renewed.I had to take the phone to Verizon to get a new sim card because I was upgrading from a Note 4 with a much larger sim card. They gave me a new sim card in minutes, plugged it in for me and it was good to go! The guy at Verizon told me they can also give me insurance on the phone but I passed.The only thing that scared me was before I got the sim card, I used the phone on wi-fi to transfer all of my apps and such over. I opened Google chrome and it went directly to a Sprint home page. So, after seeing that I was afraid it was going to be locked to Sprint but it wasn't. It must have been a Sprint phone before being unlocked.The only reason I took off a star was because of the little scratches on the screen and the shoddy charger.I will update my review if things turn south with the phone in my 90 warranty period.If you found this review helpful, please click the button below.

"Charging port doesn't insert phone, not original type c charger, phone turns off at 14%","The phone wasn't in it's original box ""Samsung"", the charger wasn't the original one, it didn't come with the plastic new phones come to be protected from scratches, and the phone was also power on. The area you insert to charge the phone is a little off, in the sense of that the type C cable would not stay inside to charge the phone. You have to insert it very hard and even with that, the phone notifies me that it's not properly charging. I shouldn't have to insert the cable that roughly because no Samsung ever required that. The phone takes forever to charge, I put my phone to charge 12am it's 5:55am on a dec 6, 2019 and it has charged to 84%. The phone is nice and easy to maneuver but it has a flaw in the charging port area. The battery is also flaky because the phone turns off at 14%. This has been a huge disappointment and expensive mistake. I am returning the device.New update: I reached out to the third party selling this item for a refund. They never responded so I had to contact amazon and file a report with them. Amazon try reaching out to them and the third party didn’t comply. Amazon had to pay me back for the money that these people owed me. Do not buy anything from them.",2019年12月6日 在美国审核,0

Note 9 honest review,"I generally don't add reviews on products, but the reviews of others helped me make this purchase so I am paying it forward. First, I highly recommend you check the seller before buying and making sure they have a high rate of positive reviews and low rate/if any negative reviews. Also make sure they adhere to Amazons return policy, I saw a seller or two with additional hoops they add on top of the return policy, and I wasn't trying to bother with that noise. I purchased my Note 9 from CR Daily Deals. So far about 2 weeks after purchasing I am pretty satisfied with the phone. I previously had a Samsung Note 5 and the upgrade to the Note 9 was pretty nice. The biggest change between them being the battery life, the Note 9 lasts me from 6:30am to about 10pm and is about 50% battery life, its really nice not being tethered to a wall every few hours. I received only the Phone itself and a generic charger block and wire. No stylus nibs or extractor, biggest pain is no SIM card key, which also happens to be where the SD card is located. Thankfully 128gb is plenty for me for the foreseeable future of my use on this phone. Very easily got the phone activated on Verizon with a 5 minute store trip, and then using the Smart Switch app was able to move over literally everything from previous phone. At this point, putting both phones next to each other, you would only be able to notice a difference in the phone itself otherwise all my apps, photos, folders, etc. are exactly where they were on my previous phone. So far, no complaints on how the phone works (aside from small things I need to get used to), and no issues with the performance of the phone. The phone did also have a screen protector already installed on it, however it was almost 100% from previous owner not the seller and it does not cover the curvature of the screen. Literally just this morning I noticed there is a slight chipping to the edge of the protector, I highly recommend getting a protector that actually covers the entirety of the screen, that is my next purchase.<br>Overall, if you are somewhat hesitant to make the purchase, I will let you know so was I. Thankfully it ended up being a great purchase and I would recommend the seller CR Daily Deals or GoOverstock.com from the sellers I have seen. You are also covered by a solid return policy, but here's to hoping that will be unnecessary. Good luck out there!</br>",2019年8月27日 在美国审核,0

Runs quickly too. Works just fine with mt Metro PCS account. Super easy to transfer my data and contacts as well. Came with a nice set of ear buds, something I wasn't expecting.

Great phone but you may need to buy a couple,"**Update**<br>The phone would not not connect to Sprint 4G. Samsung acknowledged that there is a software problem due to the merger of Sprint and Tmobile and they are not compatible with Sprint at the moment. Had to file an A-to-Z claim with O'Crack because they never refunded me after returning the phone.I ended up buying a few of these phones and returning the one I didn't want. The first one I received from Digital Age USA and had a screen protector on it, and a small gash. It was obviously a pre-owned phone that they were trying to pawn off as a reconditioned phone. If you receive a phone with a screen protector remove it immediately and check the screen, most of the time they are trying to hide screen burn or scratches. The second phone I received was from O'Crack and was like night and day, it was like a brand new phone. I am so glad I purchased the second one because I was starting to think that that was the quality of phones from this listing. The return went seamlessly and I was refunded my money within about a week. The phone itself is amazing, I've used the phone all day and still cannot drain the battery completely. The camera is very impressive in low light settings. I'm very happy with my purchase and it would recommend it.</br>",2020年10月11日 在美国审核,2

I admit I was a bit hesitant - I do not regret this purchase.,"I will admit I was a little hesitant on picking up a ""Renewed"" phone, I wasn't sure what to expect. I purchased the Midnight Black Note 9 from DNCL-TECHZONE, INC and so far I could not be more happy.<br>The phone came secured in an unmarked white box inside the Amazon package with a charger brick and a cable, I already knew this from the description and previous comments/reviews so this was not a surprise, I have headphones and other chargers so this was not a factor.My first impression out of the box - cosmeticallythe phone is absolutely flawless, no scratches anywhere, screen is perfectly fine. It even had what appeared as a form fitting protective plastic film along the top protecting the SIM card tray and the bottom where the speaker, charging port and S-Pen is located. The phone booted up fast, it guided me through the setup just like a brand new phone. Since the battery was down to 18% I charged it, again no issues at all. Full charge to 100% took about 2 hours, 20 minutes, (I'll probably pick up a fast charger at a later date.)Now coming from iPhone/ iOS the Android system is completely new to me and a slight learning curve, but a fun one. It did need a software update, it looks like the update from Aug. 2019 that adds Night photo mode, new user interface, other new features to the Android system. The update installed without any problems. Opening multiple apps, working with split screen, playing with the S-Pen, the phone is super fast, no apps - or phone crashed.I was working initially via WiFi with downloading apps, connecting email accounts, etc. A slight concern that I had was - would my Verizon SIM card on my iPhone work on the Note 9? (I've seen some posts that SIM cards have slight issues when swapped) For me, it worked without a problem, the Note immediately showed the device as a Verizon connected phone. Some of my contacts both iPhone and Android users transferred from my iPhone over to the Note 9, not all of them though - not quite sure why, I just assume that's a Verizon setting perhaps, not a big deal. Text messages worked fine, phone call quality is great. Adding the 128GB Micro SD - same area where the SIM card is located - immediately bumping this to a 256GB phone is also a beautiful thing!So far so good. I'm very happy with this purchase. I do recommend this seller.</br>",2019年10月23日 在美国审核,0

What a steal at $370 (Bought from Mobile Spree),"PREFACE: I purchased my phone from the Vendor Mobile Spree because I saw the reviews and nobody mentioned who they bought it from which made it difficult to find who was iffy with their Note 9 renewed versions so I had to do some researching. I found Mobile Spree with 9,000+ reviews with a rating thats almost 5 stars, so I went with that vendor so this is a review of Mobile Spree's Renewed Note 9.Review: Mobile Spree phone IS FACTORY UNLOCKED. I used the phone to use with Boost Mobile which means it also works with Sprint. So far its been a great Note 9. It looks almost brand new and works so much faster than my old S7 that I bought new for $600 which is insane to think I paid more for my S7 than I did for a Note 9, $370, THAT WAS 1000 dollars just last year. I didn't set my expectations so high since I knew this was a used phone, not refurbished its a used phone. There was some scratches on the edge of the screen thats like 1 mm long that looks like someone lightly scratched it against a wall or a concrete floor but it is not noticeable when the phone is on. You have to put your face against the phone and look at it in an angle. This was expected of a used phone so its not problem since I got a plastic film screen protector and I can't see the scratch at all anymore even actively looking for it. As for my BIGGEST concern with buying the phone is the battery life and if it would be horrible. I tested it and found it to have 3,600mAh capacity down from the 4,000mAh factory capacity which is great thats 90% of the battery life remaining after 1 year being used. Its so much better than my S7 which only had 57% capacity of its battery left after 3 years of poor battery usage (letting the battery go to 0%, leaving it plugged in over night, charging to 100% all the time, etc) A tip to prolong your battery life is to charge from a low 40% to about 60-70% and you'll keep your battery healthy for almost triple what it would be if you charged to 100% or left your phone plugged charging all night.My disappointment is the fact that the phone didn't come with a ""good"" charger, it came with a generic cord and generic AC adapter not a fast charging adapter. This was expected since the description said it probably wouldn't come with the factor accessories but I still wanted a somewhat good charger. I ended up just buying an Anker AC plug and USB-C cord.",2019年12月11日 在美国审核,2
Pristine Note 9 factory unlocked,"Hybrid IT sent me exactly what I ordered-a lavender note 9 factory unlocked. It was in pristine condition with no scratches or dings.

I've owned a Note II, a Note 4 and now a gorgeous Note 9.I had no issues transferring data between my Note 4 and the new phone. I used Smart Swich and it worked great.I initially had an issue with Straightalk person who couldn't figure out how to set up a phone that hadn't been purchased through ST. I finally gave up, panicked a little, then called back and a supervisor answered. He had no problem confirming the IMEI, adding new phone to my account and moving phone number to new phone.It took about 10 minutes on phone and less than 5 minutes after hanging up, my new phone was fully activated.I'm even getting a better cell signal probably due to a newer modem in the phone.Mine is a SM-960U which is the factory unlocked version.I won't hesitate to buy through Hybrid IT again because of their quick response to questions I had, the pristine phone I received and the fact that phone arrived 3 days earlier than expected.Be sure to check all sellers when looking for a refurbished phone since Hybrid IT may be on the additional sellers listed.I would have missed them ifI hadn't looked at all sellers, read reviews and read the description of the seller's company.I bought a nice Spigen case that matches the lavender to protect the glass back these phones have.",2020年9月3日 在美国审核,2

Shocked,"You know... I was on the fence about getting this. There are so many deals from private sellers locally but I thought well it is prime and can be returned so despite some of the awful reviews I went ahead and bought it. Best decision I have made in a long time. I am shocked. I am a tech guy and this phone is perfect. The battery health is at 97 percent. Not a single scratch on either side (I looked with Intense lighting) and every single component (wifi, Bluetooth, speakers, you name it) all work perfectly. I honestly feel like this phone was used maybe once and returned. Even the s-pen has full charge capacity. I could not be more satisfied. I will continue purchasing from this seller in the future!",2021年5月27日 在美国审核,2
Wonderful - but make sure you choose the right seller,"I've never purchased a renewed phone and wasn't sure what to expect. Most of these phones are sold by multiple sellers - and you can see their ratings on Amazon. I paid a little bit more (literally pennies more) to get it from Hybrid IT and I'm so glad I did. When I got the phone it looked new (no scratches or anything) but the sent the wrong version and the S-pen wasn't working. I was really mad and left a mean review but literally first thing the next morning Mark from Hybrid IT called and made sure I got a replacement by 1 day air. The replacement phone is perfect, and the seller's service was above and beyond my expectations - they could not have been nicer even when I was being a bit of a jerk.So by all means try a renewed phone, you'll pay a fraction of the new price. Just make sure you buy it from a seller with high ratings. I'm biased but I would strongly recommend Hybrid IT. They're a class act.",2020年8月26日 在美国审核,2

"If you think it isn't unlocked, read this first.","If you think your phone is not unlocked and still on Verizon, read this. Mine was like this and came with the Verizon start up screens, apps and a message saying ""Verizon SIM not inserted"", it was driving me crazy. After completing about 3 or 4 system updates, over about 30 minutes or so, it started booting up with the T-Mobile screen as per my SIM card. So, after all the updates the original carrier branding is gone and the current carrier info is there. Other than that, the phone looks like brand new and it was shipped quickly.

I would definitely recommend this phone as well as the the seller.,"This phone is a great buy for me.I don’t do contracts through the phone providers.After researching for about a week between the new S10, S20, &amp; Note 10 verse the S9 Note 8, &amp; Note 9; this was by far the best buy for the price and functionality.It came within two days, and was a new phone with the fast charger (basic necessities only).Transferred all my information easily from my old Galaxy S5.I have not set up the face recognition yet, I didn’t buy the case and screen protector until after I was sure the phone was indeed what was advertised.Battery life seems to be great so far.A great price for a Samsung phone made within the past 6 - 9 months.I would definitely recommend this phone as well as the the seller.The phone was exactly the same as advertised with no hassles, &amp; no delays in the order.",2020年3月22日 在美国审核,1
Seems like a brand new phone. Seller was Edge Cellular.,I was very hesitant about buying my refurbished Note 9 after reading all the reviews here. Saying that i decided to not buy the cheapest option and instead got my phone from the seller Edge Cellullar. They had a very good rating from a higher number of total ratings so decide to go with them. It was about $25 more but i could not be more happy.The phone i got is so perfect it makes me think they sent a brand new phone. It is a normal factory unlocked phone with no carrier apps. When i turned it on it was exactly like any other brand new unlocked phone i have bought before with the stock android UI.It also came with a brand new samsung charger and usb-c cable and the data migration plug. It even came with some earbuds even though it says right in the description those are not included. I did not rate the battery life as i just got the phone but otherwise im ecstatic with it so far.,2020年1月28日 在美国审核,1
Great upgrade from S5,"Received 5/31/19. Writing 6/3/19.Package included an unlocked 512gb Note 9, USB C cable, and a weird low voltage charger. That charger may or may not be normal specs for a new Note 9 but I expected a fast charge adapter.Connected without issue to Google Fi network with a new sim card.For the phone itself, I can't compare to current generation cell phones. Against my Samsung S5 the Note 9 replaced, feels like an entirely different piece of technology after the Android 9 improvements, processor &amp; memory upgrades.The stylus is fun to play with. I like to scribble and love the idea of taking ad-hoc notes without needing to search for paper. Time will tell if it becomes a tool for me, or gimmick.Coming from 16gb to 512gb is like moving out of a studio apartment into a mansion. I'll figure out a way to use up all the space, but right now it's damn roomy.I have a hard time justifying the price, even in the low $600's, when there are brand new phones for hundreds less. Not to say it isn't worth it, comparatively.If you are struggling to make the leap and do nothing more than make calls, text your grandchildren cryptic half messages that make them worried you're having a stroke, and play mahjong on Tuesday's, might want to find another phone.If you enjoy leading tech and can go years with the same phone, this is a good purchase.",2019年6月3日 在美国审核,0

I do not work for the seller,"First let's address the ""stolen phone"" issue. These phones are not stolen. Amazon would not help sell stolen property. Second. These phones are in fact unlocked. Some do come with bloat wear from a previous carrier. But most do not. What I read in the negative reviews is from people who simply don't know how to set up a Droid device, so they take it to a carrier store. Guess what happens then, the carrier store realizes there's very little money to be made so they tell the customer they can't use the Amazon device. And try to sell them a new carrier branded phone. My device is basically brand new. No carrier bloatwear. No scratches dings or dents. And it works flawlessly. After about 20 updates. Which also tells me its never been assigned a carrier. And even in 2022 the Note 9 is still a great phone. And I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The shipping speed , quality of the device. Its all 9.9/10. This is a great phone.

Perfectly Satisfied! (T-mobile customer),"Despite many of the poor reviews, I took a chance on this purchase and I have been suitably impressed! Yes, the box it comes in is not a branded Samsung phone box, and the fast charger is not a branded Samsung charger, but who cares? The charger works (and is now in a drawer with all the other chargers) and the box is in the trash already. The phone is flawless! Not a scratch or fingerprint anywhere. Included in the box was a return sticker so if I was not satisfied, it was ready to return immediately.I am a T-mobile customer and I was dismayed to see the Verizon logo display on the screen on the initial boot up. I had put my T-mobile sim in the phone before the first boot so I was thinking ""ah crap, going to have to return it"" but the phone displayed a message something to the effect of ""do you want to reset the phone?"" which displayed over the standard Android new phone experience wizard you would expect to see when starting a new phone. I clicked on ""yes"" and the phone restarted. It displayed the Android logo with the two arrows slowly spinning for about 15 seconds, then the phone restarted and BAM! There was the T-mobile logo with the T-mobile startup jingle! I didn't know it would do that!The phone connected to my T-mobile network without a hitch. T-mobile wifi calling works perfectly. I use a YubiKey 5 Series dongle to secure my mobile devices and instead of needing the USB-C adapter to plug into the phone, I was prompted to place the key on the back of the phone. That was all it needed! The NFC worked perfectly.Before the end of the day, this new phone received 3 updates, the last update taking the OS to Android 10. Nice!All this for $350!

Great Phone,"I'm not going to lie―I was very leery about getting this phone. This was the first time I had ever bought a phone (up until now, I was just using hand me downs that had been given to me by family members that had upgraded) and I wanted to be sure I was getting something worth my money, especially when the asking price was around $400 (not including taxes, which were a whopping $40). I read the reviews, both negative and positive. The negative ones were mainly published by people who had purchased the phone expecting it to be factory unlocked and it wasn't, which resulted in them having a phone that was locked to a different carrier other than the one they had. I have Verizon Straight Talk, and I figured if I got a Verizon locked phone that my SIM card would work with it, so I ordered one that was Verizon locked instead of factory unlocked.It came within 3-4 days and looks brand new. Other than the barcode sticker on the back, it appears to be brand new and not refurbished. After getting it on and connected to the WiFi, I pulled the Verizon Straight Talk SIM card out of my old phone and popped it into the new one. It started working immediately and has been ever since. I've now a case and a protective screen on it to keep it as safe as possible. It has been and currently is working great.

The charger was generic, and they don't include the tool to remove the sim card tray or headphones. The phone looked brand new other than some adhesive that was stuck to the top of the phone I'm guessing this was from a screen replacement. It took some time to get setup with my service. I noticed some people saying it was locked out. When I put my sim card in the phone it said this device is not on a registered network. To fix this I did a factory reset. This also did not work at first. After trying a factory reset I called my phone provider and told them I would like to change to an unlocked phone and use the same sim card. They asked for the IMEI# and a few other things and set it up on there end. After speaking with my carrier and transfering phones on there end I did one last factory reset so the phone would recognize the carrier change and when it powered back on everything was working and the phone has better service than my old phone.

Note 9 is a great choice for a bargain,"This phone may be 2 generations old now, but boy can this thing fly.

This thing is beautiful. The note 9 has a huge screen and the color is so vibrant.- The stylus: It is crazy to me this is a pro because Samsung seems to be killing off the note line. There is so much functionality here from taking pictures, jotting notes, and if you are feeling creative doodling.- Audio jack: This still has a physical audio jack and it is the last phone with it from Samsung.- Gaming: My brother-in-law loves playing PUBG and he says playing on this is so smooth. I prefer a controller or keyboard myself. But if your looking to game on a phone this one can handle it like a champ!=======================================Cons:- He isn't a fan of the curved screen, but all Samsung phones have this. At this point if you don't want a curved screen you have to look somewhere else.- Fingerprints. This phone shows fingerprints shockingly easily, but most do.==============Overall: If you can't tell by now this phone is a winner. For as cheap as it is now you can't lose.

Exactly as advertised.,"I purchased this Note as a secondary device for work productivity and Google Home integration (my iPhone does neither very well). I'm not entirely sure what kind of problems some of the other reviewers were having with getting their service to work, but I can assure you that this is an unlocked handset. It came out of the box with Verizon carrier settings, and all I did was put my Mint Mobile SIM in and it auto-loaded the T-Mobile (backbone for Mint) carrier settings and rebooted. Worked instantly. It even automatically deleted the Verizon bloatware and replaced it with the T-Mobile bloatware! :)As far as the device itself goes, you get what you pay for. This is a renewed device, and there are caveats that go with the purchase of said type of device. Having said that though, it looked and ran like a brand new handset right out of the box. No issues with performance whatsoever. The screen was in perfect condition. The only MINOR physical imperfection is the way the bottom of the screen meets with the steel frame of the phone. Nothing broken, scratched, or loose. I THINK the screen has possibly been replaced, and something just couldn't be re-aligned like it was originally in manufacturing. It should definitely be noted that I had to LOOK to find this. The average person who isn't insane, like myself, would never notice it.The last note (haha) is the battery condition. According to AccuBattery, the battery is around 84% capacity. This is a renewed device that I paid $365 for which originally sold for $1000 just over a year ago.

Exceeded Expectations but Winding Path to Get to Purchase,"My experience with the Note 9 has been very good. It has been by far the best smart device phone that I have owned. I have had it about 4 months.To create context, I almost went with the Pixel 3, but the whole ""notch"" discussion plus the product cycle and limited distribution gave me hesitation. My Note 8 which I owned for over 2 years was a disaster. The screen tension was horrible which led to many micro-fractures. It lacked durability. The battery life was horrible and Samsung pushes an incredible amount of bloatware at you. Also there is no good reason to use Bixby and Samsung keeps pushing that at you as well which affects usability and customer experience. Samsung almost lost me.I wasn't predisposed to getting the Note 9.But i did.The Note 9 in my experience has been everything that the Note 8 was not - durable, long battery life, fast processing, great photo quality etc. The 128G version is just fine and can be extended if necessary with a micro sd. Why would anyone put more than 128G on their phone? I purchased a ""refurbished"" from a reseller, in an unlocked version to keep the cost down, and as it turned out it worked just fine. But transferring the SIM chip and doing the restore I was operational pretty quickly.I can now recommend the Note 9 with a clear conscience. A solid device... The alternative that could be considered is the One Plus 6 T. I did a little research post purchase and the 6T stood out for both cost and design. It seems like it would be a viable alternative. It is only distributed through T-mobile or online.But Note 9 is good for my purposes, specifically a mix of business and personal. Hopefully this can help you.",2019年3月10日 在美国审核,1

But not only did this phone come in only 2-3 days (which was wayyy earlier than it was estimated to come) but it also came in mint condition. Im talking the samsung sticker still on and everything. Not one scratch or any indication that it was every used. The S pin was in mint condition too. It didnt come in the original box but i dont really mind when it comes to stuff like that. The little box it came in was good enough for me. It also came with a fast charger which saved me money since i was expecting to get a crappy charger and have to go buy another one. Im veryyyy satisfied with my purchase and will be recommending this to anyone interested in getting a new samsung phone ;),2021年12月21日 在美国审核,2
Fantastic!!,"I've been meaning to write this positive review for 3 months because all the negative reviews almost deterred me from what is by far my best purchase ever from Amazon! I didn't want a hard inquiry on my credit and a monthly payment to finance a cell phone through my wireless carrier. Everything was perfect about this purchase!! I received a *flawless* Galaxy Note 9 with a Samsung stylus and USB-C charger; the only difference from ""brand new"" was the plain box. There was not a single scratch or blemish on the phone or screen and I had no issues with the phone reading my TMOBILE SIM (this seems to be most people's chief complaint, and a small amount of time and research could surely rectify this issue). It was completely plug and play and I still cannot believe I got a phone this nice for less than $400. Fast shipping, perfect product, I am very, very pleased with this purchase.",2020年1月15日 在美国审核,2
"2022 customer, it works!","I ordered the midnight black one and it came in quickly. Everything was new, with no scratches or single dust on it. I powered it on and tried to insert my old phone sims card to it to activate it but it didn't work which quickly made me worry if the phone was locked or if I got scammed. (Tmobile sims btw) and I later found out I had to actually call T-Mobile and request it. It ended up working after I got off the phone and I transferred my data over and everything. So it's working now perfectly. I know some people think it's locked liked I did but try calling your carrier and request to transfer it through them. Everything else I tried didn't work and I almost gave up. Just do this method if you having that problem.",2022年3月11日 在美国审核,2
This is how I feel about my first Amazon "renewed" phone purchase...,"(I wanted to show you guys a picture but I only have one phone and Amazon wouldn't let me upload the pic from the order--so use your imagination -- it is a Lavender Samsung Galaxy Note 9, with a Lavender stylus. Looks brand new)I have never ordered a phone from Amazon. I feel like everything is a huge warehouse which can make for easy mistakes on a small order. But I was NOT disappointed by my purchase. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 128GB, Lavender Purple - For T-Mobile (Renewed) -- I was going to opt for an unlocked, but I felt like it would just make life difficult if it wasn't compatible with my network in some way -- I knew I was not changing carriers so may as well go with my current carrier.When I first got my phone at first I thought something was wrong with the screen because on one side of the phone it required more pressure than the other side to operate properly. I thought it might have been the screen protector I put on it (it's a thicker one that blocks side-eye views of the phone) but then I realized the settings FOR screen protectors to allow for more touch sensitivity had to be turned on (still not sure why only 1 side was effected, but at least this setting being activated was the solution for the entire phone).The phone came with the specified GB and features.Great reception/strong signal -- meaning no dropped calls in areas where I don't normally have calls dropped calls.Zero issues being compatible with TMobile. It took the rep less than 10 minutes to sync my phone to the carrier and switch over everything from my old phone to my new phone.Stylus is fine.. it sometimes says that it's low on connectivity when I haven't used it long, but the functionality is still there so I don't worry about it.The price for this phone came at the PERFECT time in my situation.It was probably priced lower because it is a lavender phone. But I bought a black case for it, so don't let a color you don't like deter you. To protect these investments we're going to get a case anyway so save money and buy a less desired color like I did.Everyone couldn't believe I got it for this low--- no other online retailer had this price with this type of guarantee which is why I risked it. And I'm glad I did.I waited over a month to create the review so that I could really ensure the phone's operational consistency. And I am not disappointed. Gets 5 stars for shipping, accuracy of description, pricing, and quality of phone.Thanks again.",2021年9月13日 在美国审核,2

Whats Not to Like? NOTHING !,This is not my first Note 9 nor dare I say will it be the last as we use them in business. We have used these phones as portable computers as well as phones and the Note 9 shines in all the ways we need it too. We have had and have both the 512g and the 128g and they have done the job equally well with the 512g being only a tiny bit faster than the 128g. No problems with battery life or performance and in fact no short comings at all so far. This is why we continue to buy and use them. They are now less than half the price of what they were and for us a better value than the the 2 newer models with less features. These are rock solid phones and believe the best bang for the buck giving up Nothing!,2020年1月13日 在美国审核,0

Happy with this,I was worried about buying a refurbished phone from here but I ordered 1 for me and 1 for my wife and we love them.

"Works with Verizon, Read Below","Works with Verizon but you'll need to have a micro SIM already on-hand.I bought this phone but only had a regular SIM card available. I went to Verizon and they refused to give me a micro SIM for this phone since ""it's not compatible"". However, I had another phone that took a micro SIM card available and got a new micro SIM registered to that device.Once I was out of Verizon, I swapped the new SIM into this phone and it works perfectly.So, either have an micro SIM already registered or you will need to have a ""Verizon Compatible"" phone available to get a new micro SIM registered to your account.Not sure why Verizon insists on having your SIM tied to a ""Verizon Compatible"" device, even if the device supports their CDMA network.Phone was in great condition.

"Great Phone, Absolutely Stupid Design","I have been using computers since the 70s when I was in college and purchased my first IBM clone in 1992, and was using PDAs very early on.I had one of the first Windows smart phones but got rid of it in favor of a flip phone.....why?As a physician, I had been tied to a pager for years, and I really hated trying to do anything with such a small screen.I never jumped on the iPhone bandwagon either.Finally, as the screen sizes have increased, I decided, ok, there are apps that I may find useful as well as the integration of my Google Calander and Contacts with my phone.But, while sure, I could spend over a grand on a new phone, it just did not seem to me to be a wise use of my money.I had read that a lot of smartphone addict aficionados look for the latest and greatest.....or maybe they did not like the color of their new phone....so they sent it back.Rather than winding up in landfills as a lot of returned Amazon merchandise does, unfortunately, Amazon was wise enough to create their refurbished division in which various refurbishers compete for customer's business.I thought, why not give it a try.I purchased the phone from a company named Kiss in Manhattan where I grew up.They had a high positive rating so I picked themMy phone arrived the next day despite the fact that I did not pay for overnight shipping.Unfortunately, as I understand it, the ripples of the COVID situation put them out of business.As for the phone, when I opened up the box, I was shocked.In terms of appearance, there was absolutely no way I would have known it was a refurb....not a mark on it.As far as function is concerned, I used various apps to test it, and it passed.I have been using it since the first week of August.My estimate of battery life remaining is upwards of 90 percent.Of note, at Batteries and Bulbs, I can replace the battery for something like 70 dollars still putting me way ahead of the game since the phone was under 400 dollars.Add a Microcenter 512 MicroSD card for about 50 dollars and I have a phone with 3/4 of a terabyte, far more storage than I anticipate ever using.So, why the 4 stars?The phone is very elegant looking, especially with its curved display.As such, it would look very nice put upon a pedestal in our living room.However, I did not find the phone in an art store.I purchased it to use every day as my mobile phone.What is the Note 9 made of?Simply put, it is basically glass placed over a metal frame which again is fine if you want to display it on your bookshelf, but not particularly practical.Unless a person is downright foolish, just about everyone puts a case on it.You can forget about using one of those clear cases that let the beauty of the phone shine through.Drop it and you are facing an expensive repair.I was using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case with a belt clip which I never used.The phone dropped on the stairs and the inner part of the case broke.I was not really upset about that for the simple reason it saved the phone.Now I am trying an Outbox Defender which looks pretty robust.How about the curved display?Yes, it looks rather elegant, but does one really need it for functionality?The answer is absolutely not.It only serves to make designing a screen protector problematic.As for screen protectors go, I think they are necessary and I have just resigned myself to the fact that the edge adhesives are going to wear out and to simply replace them every once and awhile.They are not particularly expensive.We as consumers really should not put up with this nonsense.Most of the smartphones made these days have similar designs.They reinforce the notion of built-in obsolescence, or in actuality, built-in fragility.Yes, technology changes very rapidly.But, the basic technology of how these phones communicate does not.There is absolutely no reason that we should have to get a new phone every year.They should last far longer than that in my humble opinion.The question is how can we communicate this to the manufacturers?We can't boycott them because they all pretty much do the same thing. It is something it think about.....just saying.",2020年11月3日 在美国审核,2

Go to settings, apps, right hand corner there's three little dots click on those and select system apps. Then you'll scroll down until you see Sprint OMADM .. force stop and clear everything. You're phone will work then. It is completely unlocked. Will work with any carrier. Came with stylus and phone charger. Buttons a little rough you have to press down firmly.

Great phone I'm back in the game,"I have seen some reviews where people have had problems with the phones they have received. I am happy to say I have had none of these. Pros: Fast shipping and phone came on time, phone look like new . The phone was unlocked none of the phone service bloat ware (my service is AT&amp;T) only Samsung and Google apps which can also be deleted if you so chose. Battery life seems good came in with a 40-50%charge. S-pen fully functional new and Samsung branded. I just popped in my sim card and service was ready to go. Great value for the money.Cons: Phone was not the ocean blue like my other one it was darker and more purple looking (side note this could be because it was a newer version of the phone and has darker paint it was also ever so slightly smaller then my original note 9) but who cares I put a case on it anyway. Came with generic chargerand wasn't a adaptive fast charger ethier. All in all very good buy will buy from them again........Pro tip mine came with the voice assistance turned on which messes with things when trying to initially set up the phone just skip through the Google and Samsung set up stuff get to the main screen go turn off voice assistance then update the phone then you can set up all the things like Google, Samsung accounts lock screen ect with no issue. Also if the touch is not working well during the set up use the S-pen to navigate..this is due to the phone trying to download updates while you are also trying to set it up..hope this helps ",2019年11月26日 在美国审核,2
First Impressions,"It's only been a few hours since I received this phone but I couldn't wait to post a review! I was super skeptical about ordering a phone online like this but I'm glad I did. First of all, I got the package way earlier than the expected delivery date which was awesome. Phone works great, I've noticed 0 problems so far. I saw in the phone information it said the brand was Sprint so I was initially worried it wasn't truly unlocked. But it activated no problem! I got a BYOP sim card kit from Straight Talk and used the Verizon sim card. Had no problem whatsoever! I absolutely love the phone itself. It's much bigger than the galaxy s8 I had and I love the stylus! It's super cool, and you can program the button on it to open an app. Lots of other cool features like the wide selfie and gif recorder (smart select S pen tool). I'm sure there's a lot I haven't even gotten into. No cracks or scratches. Can't quite comment on the battery life yet since I'm still on the first charge. The charging port looks a little worn but it works. The charger was off brand but I suppose I saved enough on the phone to splurge for a fast charging cord. ♀ Overall very happy.I will definitely update my review if I find any problems, but for now I am pleasantly surprised!",2020年9月3日 在美国审核,1
Been using this for almost a year now,"I thought it was a really good deal, a note9 for $420. It really was, never had any issues with it unless I keep it on and don't restart it once every 1.5-2 weeks it will slow down and have some issues. But other than that, all functions work properly and won't probably upgrade until next year as it is not giving me any issues at all. Facial recognition and the fingerprint sensor work seamlessly. The amount of options you have to customize how all the buttons work and other motions and how things work in general is amazing, haven't bought an iPhone since the 5S came out and am definitely never going back to iOS. You can get so much more out of an android phone, specially the Note series from Samsung, plus not to mention all the varieties of other phones that run Android, so many to pick and all so different.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核,1
Pleasantly surprised,"No incentive to write this review, just wanted to because I myself scan a million reviews before ordering everything.I broke my note 8 that I got for free and didn't want to spend a fortune on a new phone. I first ordered the moto stylus 2021 since its semi comparable and costs less but its way to big for my liking. Then I tried the 2020 version. The size was perfect but there's no notification light (sounds like a stupid gripe but important to me) and a few other things that made me miss my Samsung. I didn't even necessarily need the 9 but for the price why not. I kept the moto 2020 until my renewed Note 9 came in just in case, as I was super nervous about getting a renewed phone but when I tell you this thing looks perfect I mean it. Not a visible scratch on it, front or back. The fingerprint part is slightly and visibly worn but that's it. The phone does get hot sometimes but I can't tell if its any fault to being renewed or just is what it is. The phone is absolutely beautiful, the sound is amazing and a big upgrade from the 8. I got the lavender, which is a different tone from the 8 and I love this color version even more than the last. Shipping was to be between the 15-18 and it came the 15th ..and maybe the best part for me personally was that I was able to transfer everything from one Samsung to the other in 10 minutes with Smart Switch. I was struggling with this part with the other brand and it was essential because of the things I had stored.Would absolutely recommendordering from here, and just incase, you have a good return period if anything does go wrong. Make sure you're not ordering renewed from a knock off place..those will probably not offer a return date. Super happy with this phone. Thankful I took the risk.",2021年9月20日 在美国审核,2

This was a renewed device, so I didn't expect it to look brand new.The reviews I read mentioned not having the necessary accessories in the box.

The only flaw I could see was a small scratch on the glass, if you tilt it in the sunlight at the right angle. When the screen in on I can't even see it. Battery seems fine charges really fast.

Went from Note 5 to Note 9 with no regrets.,"I loved my Note 5 but after the Note 10 came out, I realized the 5 was starting to show its age.To be sure, I could replace the battery and probably get a couple more decent years out of the 5 but it wasn't getting any more Android updates and I could tell it was getting a little slower to launch apps.However I didn't want to spend upwards of a $1,000 on the shiny new Note 10.It didn't help that my wife had already upgraded her Note 5 to an 8.So after some soul searching and web searching for a good priced, gently used Note 9, I decided on this one.So far it's amazing!The battery life is easily double that of the 5 and apps snap open.The only thing I miss so far is the Flipboard/Briefing that was available on the 5 by swiping right.Instead there's Bixby now, but maybe I just need to customize and get used to it.The Note 9 itself arrived in near new condition.The screen is crystal clear with no scuffs or scratches, the back has a slight scuff which disappears when I put the clear case/cover on.",2019年9月4日 在美国审核,0

Please read if you are metro,Am a long term metro cust and totally new to the unlocked phone scene. So was overjoyed when I hooked it up to wifi and had it working wonderfully. Google assistant was good and phone generally seemed impressive. Was then equally pissed off when I plunked in my metro card and Sim was not working. I was under impression it would work fine out of box. Anyhow I contacted the seller Wireless warehouse USA and they advised I needed to notify metro of the phones imee number (or similar) to get it to work on their network. So so took it in and paid $16.00 and now I have a kick ass flag ship phone for a bargain price. Working perfectly so far. This one is a keeper.

The Note 9 turned out to be the best for the price (and the price for this renewed Note 9 had dropped over $100 by the time I actually got around to making the purchase).I selected renewed, NOT the renewed premium, and the Note 9 I received might as well be brand new.

Good refurbished product,"There are plenty of places to find reviews of the device itself - my short summary would be that this is still a great flagship, even in 2020.But the main focus here is that this is a refurbished unit.

No scratches or even smudges - you really couldn't tell it wasn't brand new.After a few months of use, I see no indication of any issues with this device.Considering the low price and great condition of the phone, I'd say this is a great choice for anyone looking for a large and powerful phone on a budget.",2020年10月3日 在美国审核,2

After playing with the phone for a while I noticed the S pen wouldn't connect so I thought, here we go.... I contacted Hybrid IT (the seller) the next day through Amazon and they responded in less than 5 minutes. They gave me a choice of an immediate refund of enough to buy a new s pen on my own (if I was in a hurry) or to ship me a new one no questions asked. I chose to let them send me a new one and low and behold I had a tracking number 5 minutes later. My new pen arrived in 2 days and works perfectly.

Very pleased,"Initially I was a little nervous ordering a refurbished phone after seeing mixed reviews online. However, I'm on a tight budget and can't afford this phone at full price so it was worth the chance (knowing I could return it for a refund if there was a problem) I've had the phone about a month now and it's been like new with no problems. Absolutley no wear and tear on the phone out of the box. Came w/ original box, charger, headphones etc. My roommate bought the same phone new from BestBuy and we received all the same accessories, and he regrets not buying his on Amazon. |As far as the phone features goes, I think it's the best phone on the market right now. I've watched MANY YouTube videos on the different phones and features and the Note9 is far superior with camera settings, Bixby vision, Spen etc. Truly an amazing phone and I'm loving it!",2019年3月26日 在美国审核,1

About a month into using this phone and it fell out of my pocket while sitting and the s-pen must have dislodged and hit just right to Crack the casing. Contacted the seller to see if they sold replacements and they are sending out a replacement for free even though it's not under warranty, and have no obligation to do so. Please anyone reading this support this business while saving money, phones are expensive. This has been the best experience on Amazon, the internet, and probably earth as a whole.

May have to jump through hoops,"Well this phone is factory Verizon unlocked....I purchased it to switch h from straight talk to Verizon prepay however when I tried to activate the phone over the internet it said that the phone was not compatible with the Verizon network<br>Ok frustration sinks in, I call the seller and believe it or not the women on the other end was knowledgable, stating that the phone is in fact comparable with any network and that this isn't the first time this has happened.Ths reasoning is I did not buy the phone from Verizon so they lie to get you to buy a phone off of them, and if I went to a store and explained the situation that the phone would get activated...I have a family member who is in corporate for Verizon wireless and his comment was ""this is probably true""...So not wanting to go to the store I popped out my straight talk sim card from my old phone into this new note 9 and it works perfectly...so f Verizon, the item shipped in 2 days and thecustomer service was good....just be cautious you may need to jump through some hoops however its probably the cheapest you can get this phone</br>",2019年2月1日 在美国审核,2
Incredible Value,"My Galaxy Note 9 (Ocean Blue) arrived two days after ordering. It was packed a little loosely within its smaller box but survived the trip without apparent issue. The generic charging block/cable are functional. Minimal signs of wear are faded paint surrounding the charging port (from blind plugging no doubt) and a barely worn stylus tip. Completely functional device, no loose buttons or internal rattling, battery life easily beating my old Galaxy S8. I plugged my SIM card in and went through some restart/update cycles and am good to go. AWESOME. Easily worth the $250.",2021年8月2日 在美国审核,0

Yes...the phone was probably a Verizon phone before (based on the start-up screen), but I have bought unlocked phones before. Currently using this in The Bahamas with a local sim, so it is giving me what I need in terms of SIM card and network flexibility.3) the performance of the phone is top rate.

Better than described,"Shipped fast and was better than described by seller. The phone is a refurb and the marring and scratches described are so slight they are tough to find.

Pretty good but minor scuffs and not factory unlocked.,"The phone I received had 2 small scuffs on the screen, like it was dropped on concrete but didn't crack the screen, there's one in the bottom right corner that is pretty visible but just off of the screen so it doesn't matter, and the other one is a bit smaller but on the screen, though when the screen is on you can't see it so it's not a deal breaker or a reason to send it back.Other than that it has some small surface scratches (who tf doesn't put a screen protector on a brand new phone?) but those aren't visible with the screen on either and I applied a screen protector to stop any of them from getting worse.This isn't a factory unlocked phone either as when starting it up it had the sprint logo and the model number is a sprint phone, but as soon as I put a tracphone sim in it updated the carrier and got rid of the sprint startup logo (didn't know that was possible to get rid of), so it's definitely an unlocked phone now as all carriers are required to unlock phones after a contract is up and even though it's not a factory unlocked phone you should have no issues, if you do have any just get a replacement cause this is a fantastic deal for this powerhouse of a phone.NOTE: My seller was Hybrid IT, the different sellers are all different refurbishers so if you get a bad phone return it for a refund and buy it from a different seller, most are around the same price anyhow.",2019年11月18日 在美国审核,0

So long story short, this is a useless phone that cannot be unlocked until the original owner pays it off.I was pretty much sold a brick for 600.00.This seller should not be allowed to sell things on here if they don't have to common sense to make sure the phone is useable first.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核,0

Best value for an Android power user on a budget,"I've had mine just three days but it is the best smart phone purchase decision. I will never again spend outrageous money on the latest smart phone every two years (this replaces a 4+ year old 32GB Note 5 I dropped $699 on). I'm sure most have done their homework on this phone for specs, features, and performance including camera, so I won't go into features detail and instead focus on condition and personal impression. This refurb I got is in impeccable condition. Not a single scratch anywhere except a small one where someone opened the sim/SD card slot. I mean it looks brand new. After the recommended full charge before powering on, I swapped my sim card from the Note 5 (T-Mobile), and ran through the initial setup and file sync (took about an hour for 25+ GB of data from the Note 5 to move over via the wireless option on my home WiFi). It was just like setting up a brand new phone at the store.I love the ocean blue color with the yellow S-pen. It reminds me of a Blue Angel jet. A quick battery check from a test shows it is solid and rated at the full factory spec 4,000mAh. WiFi streaming music for a couple of hours didn't drain it nearly as fast as what happens with my Note 5's 3,000mAh. Besides cosmetic flaws, I was worried about the condition of the battery as you never know how the previous owner treated the phone regarding battery management. Unlike some others, my phone did not come in the original case and just had some generic USB-C charging cord. However it is the fast version for connecting to the wall. It's just not the official white Samsung unit that came with it from the factory. It works just as well as I was charging it before power up from the wall.Overall, I cannot be happier and the fact that Samsung (and Apple) are now charging $1K plus for their high end smart phones is outrageous and I refuse to spend that much. Another ""proper motivator"" for me in taking this direction was that I can install a MicroSD card up to 512GB in the same slot as the sim chip, which the Note 10 does not have in the North America markets (you have to move up to the 10+ for that). I'm not paying $150 more for the 10+ on top of an already outrageous price point just to get an SD slot (don't want the larger screen on top of that). The other good thing is that the 3.5mm audio jack is still there for wired headsets and buds. I don't want wireless as yet something else to charge no matter how ""cool"" they look. Never mind we still don't know long term brain health effects of Bluetooth.Finally, I did order a case that I also highly recommend for this if you are into a minimalist design made by FITFORT for only $15. These phones are not going to be around for much longer in such great condition in the next couple of years, and they likely will not get less expensive as I'm seeing even my old Note 5 in refurb form going for $300+ here. So if you want to upgrade an older Note or Galaxy from few series back but don't like the price or removed features of the Note 10 and Galaxy S10 over their previous generation, this is what you want. I see myself keeping this phone 3-4 years just like my 2015-era Note 5 and I actually paid nearly half as much for it.",2020年1月22日 在美国审核,1

Great phone.,"I bought this phone for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. He had an old galaxy 7 phone, I believe. It became busted and cracked with holes in the screen so he wanted an upgrade. Phone came to us in great condition and looks just like new!",2019年8月29日 在美国审核,2
Great product!,"Everything came as described and expected. The phone was in great condition with the plastic wrap still around it. The charger and its block were included. As stated in the title the phone is unlocked and mine worked just fine, I just popped my sim card in and got on with setting up the phone. The item came in a generic white box instead of its original box, which I didn't expect it to. I switched from an iPhone 6s to this and so far it is exceeding my expectations. I love the large display, the camera is speedy with great quality. Of course there are certain features that I miss from my iPhone but so far the Note 9 has enough of its own features to make me become a convert. If you've done research about the Note 9 you are aware of Bixby. I am not a fan so I downloaded an app to disable the feature. I do wish the buttons on the left side of the phone (Bixby and volume) were better positioned, because I think they're too far up but definitely not a deal breaker. All in all, this is a great phone and the certified refurbished option makes it an even more enticing option if you're looking to upgrade.",2018年11月24日 在美国审核,1

I paid Edge Cellular $675.95 for a 512GB Note 9 (Blue), a high used market price - because they listed it as 'Condition: NEW' yet it came with scratches on the back - with a dirty white generic box and sans the OEM accessories like AKG earbuds.Be aware, make sure the seller confirms the condition before you buy.",2019年10月9日 在美国审核,0

No problems with Note9,"I bought my used Note9 from the seller, Re-Cell.I upgraded from a Note3.Along with others, I think it's important that reviews name the seller as the ""adds"" seem to change sellers, so reviews are all clumped together from different sellers.The phone looks 99% new.I pulled the IMEI number and did a search to very authentic samsung phone and also to see where made as I did not made in China phone, even if used.No problems.All functions seem to work great, I have not found any issues or problems.Phone is fast, and the screen is awesome. Videos are amazing, I was very surprised at the clarity of the videos and the quality of the pictures. But, as I mentioned, I am upgrading from a Note3, which is still to me a really great phone.The Note9 battery seems to be little weak but still makes it through the day without a charge.The add states battery to be at 80% + strength, which probably is. I realize the the Note9 has a bigger battery and that was important to me, I'll still give battery life 5 star as I feel that's what Samsung gets for putting a nice big battery in there that can last all day.My phone is 18 months old according to the imei check.I did not test the fingerprint option.Overall very pleased and would not hesitate to buy a used phone again from Re-Cell.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核,0

It was Unlocked out of the Box,"I always wanted a Note phone since I got my first Galaxy phone over six years ago. Luckily with Amazon Renewed I was able to snag a Note 9 for under $400. I really wanted the Note for the S-Pen, that was the only feature my Galaxy S9+ did not have. The release of the Note 10 was a major disappointment for me which was one of the main reasons I looked at the year-old flagship Note 9. Unlikethe Note 10 which took several steps back, the Note 9 has the headphone jack, dedicated Bixby button (Extremely useful for remapping for various functions), MicroSD card support, and a fingerprint sensor on the back. All features I need as a power user.I was pleasantly surprised when I received the product and found it to be in near flawless condition with only minor scratches that aren't noticeable unless you explain the phone closely. The stylus was there and works well. The battery was in good condition and like-new. When I turned on the phone I knew it was running the unlocked firmware since I am also running the unlocked firmware for my Galaxy S9+ and it has no carrier bloatware. When I put my T-mobile SIM card it worked nearly instantly.After using it for two weeks there has been no problems with it so far, all features seem to be working as intended.I can safely say this is the best phone I have ever used and may be the best Note Samsung may ever produce.",2019年11月28日 在美国审核,0

"Looked brand new, but had issues","I was blown away at how crisp and new the phone appeared. The battery life met my expectations, therefore I was happy in that regard. Had no issues with wireless charging. However, the s-pen was dirty and had some nasty grime on it which I cleaned -- not that a big deal, but I suppose something to note. After that was managed I began to setup the phone. During the setup process I noticed a couple of times that I thought I pushed the screen to select a specific letter/number, but either nothing happened or the click selected a different letter/number. For the most part (approximately 98% of the time) the touch screen functioned as expected so I didn't completely pay attention to this intermittent issue until I used the phone for a couple of days where it became noticeable.Next thing I noticed happen to involve calling into a line where touch dial was needed to select options. Sometimes I was unable to select an option although in the call app it showed I selected a number. In addition, I had a 100% reoccurring issue with calling into a support line to receive a text to verify identification, but when I would swap back and forth from text to call again the call would not detect I selected a number. After this would occur, to remedy the issue sometimes closing and re-opening would provide a temporary solution. If that did not work I would have to power cycle the device for another temporary solution. For a workaround I would have to turn the phone sideways (landscape) to see the code that was sent to me so I could stay in the call without swapping over to my text messages to see the code.Lastly, the USB-C port was not consistent with charging or connecting to my laptop/PC for charging although the interface would click in place as it were securely connected. This issue occurred approximately 90% of the time which is highly noticeable. Sometimes thephone would not detect that I attached outlet power to it (approximately 5% - 15% occurrence). I initially thought my power adapter and or cord were the problem. I swapped both of those out, but the problem persist. In addition, when I connect to a laptop/PC via USB-C the phone is constantly detected over and over. Even if I deny the USB access the phone again is detected over and over. I tried this with a personal and work laptop, as well as my home PC which all shared the same result.I got to this last point then decided to return the phone as I know issues would have persist or become worse overtime. This is unfortunate because I was excited to continue using a Note style phone. My friends and family use iphone's. After recent discussions I finally caved in and decided to give an iphone a shot. I hope all the hype for these phones stands true.",2021年9月10日 在美国审核,1

Does not come with Official Samsung Stylus inhibiting functionality,Very disappointed phone did not come with official Samsung Stylus. Without official Samsung Stylus it inhibits some functionality of the phone. This is the reason I bought the Note in the first place. The stylus is not an accessory. It is part of the phone. I understand that a charger and cable would be considered an accessory. The Stylus was aftermarket and does not provide full functionality of the phone. This should have been known by Amazon who is the seller of this refurbished phone.,2020年7月1日 在美国审核,1

Best renewed phone with oem accessories!,"I'm impressed, bought this note 9 128gb (black Verizon ver.) a month ago from these guys with fear of recieving a used, scratched up phone with off brand charger and no accessories in a white box like others offered on Amazon. WELL I WAS WRONG!!! I received a original samsung box with everything it came with from factory in factory sealed plastic!!! Sin card pin, S-pen tips/Remover, original charger and cable, AKG headphones (sealed-new oem), charging port headphone adapter, and transfer cable!!! All ""OEM"". I was shocked!! Then with my OCD i checked the condition of the phone under a magnifying glass and light, not a SINGLE SCRATCH on the front, and only 2 very fine, almost invisible scratches on the back. Around the Bezels/Edges of the phone still had the OEM plastic liner/cover without a nick or signs of use. Overall I feel as if I scored big time and was lucky with the draw but then again, lots of other reviews for this purchase state similar experiences. Now last but not least, I waited a month to write this review for this renewed note 9 because I wanted to test the battery health and life. Phone holds a charge all day with continued use (I own a Business) as if it was new. I'd give the condition and phone accessories a 10/10 and the battery health a 9/10 for a supposedly used/renewed phone. Save yourself 500 bucks and buy from GoOverstock.

Super Duper Happy!,"Thank you Hybrid IT! I was at first apprehensive about purchasing a used phone off Amazon or anywhere online with all the bad experiences I've read about, but I'm glad I took the chance, because I'm loving my Galaxy Note 9. It looks practically new! All it had was a tiny nick on the bottom corner which is barely noticeable. I ran the IMEI and I was happy to find out it is a clean phone. I'll probably be trading it in down the road for a note 10 plus, but for now I'm Super Duper happy with this purchase. Phone looks beautiful, it works wonderfully and I had no issues connecting it to my AT&amp;T service and transferring everything even though I am tech ignorant. It also was well secured in the package and it arrived in a timely manner. I had to pick it up from Fedex, but that's because the driver was too lazy to deliver to my apt now that the leasing office is not accepting packages during Covid. Anyways, that's no fault of the seller, but I would suggest maybe using UPS or Amazon delivery instead, FedEx falls short sometimes. Welp, that's my 2 cents. Hope this helps others who may want to take the leap. Just be carefully what seller your buying from. I will definitely be purchasing other items for Hybrid IT!",2020年8月16日 在美国审核,0

SIM card matters,"First, the phone received is like new - no, and I mean no, visible usage are all! The phone came with the Samsung box, complete, like a new phone. Second, and this is for those who posted reviews about not getting the proper provider phone; this may be helpful for such future incidents. If you ordered an unlocked phone, which my supplier advertised, it is possible that a different cell provider may come up after initial boot of phone - don't be alarmed. My example, I ordered a Verizon phone, but my supplier (Amazon) also indicated the phone was unlocked, this means not locked into a specific cell provider; after fully charging the phone it booted as a T-mobile phone - NOT A PROBLEM - why - SIM Card. Power off the new phone and insert the SIM card from your old phone into your new phone, the phone will reset, there will be a couple of messages, OK, etc. Once the new phone resets it will then boot using you cell vendor phone boot process; in my case, Verizon. Hope this helps. Also, I want to say again, I am very pleased with my new NOTE9. This vendor delivered as advertised. Sidebar: The process to migrate my old phone to my new phone was a snap. Samsung makes the process very easily with its automated software process.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核,0

I regret purchasing a phone from Amazon and also this seller,"I purchased a Note 9 from this seller in October. After about 1.5 months from the purchase the phone started acting up when I connected my headphones to it. I thought there was something wrong with my headphones so I changed a few headphones but it didn't resolve the issue. I contacted the seller to replace the phone afterwards and they refused to do it and said it was a few days after the warranty period.Also when purchasing the phone I chose the option of installments with no interest to pay for the phone, I checked it multiple times and made sure that I had selected that option when checking out. But after a month they started charging interest on my credit card. When I contacted Amazon they said the installments option had not gone through, they refused to take responsibility, told me it was my error, they refused to help and after calling them multiple times one customer service told me he'd elevate the issue and gave me a ticket number. After several weeks they still haven't contacted me. I had to pay the full amount at once even though I wasn't prepared for it in order to avoid having to pay for interest and Amazon never took responsibility.I had to pay the full amount at once for a malfunctioning phone and I truly regret it. If you care about getting the service you deserve, and dealing with responsible sellers/customer service avoid purchasing a phone from Amazon and this seller.",2020年1月28日 在美国审核,1

Unfortunately this was completely untrue. The phone does not support Sprint.

Everything I Hoped it Would Be,"I got this phone to replace my cheap, older phone I'd had for a few years that was about to give out. It seriously lacked RAM so it was impossible to have more than 2 apps open at one time without the phone going hot while trying to do something simple, if not outright freeze, crash, and reboot. The battery was also giving out too, so watching movies/video was a no-go if I wanted to have the phone last more than 4-5 hours.The Note 9 was a phone that I've wanted for a little while now, and after finding it for such a steal I decided to go in and get one. Overall, I really can't complain much. The phone came turned off with a charger cable and was pre-wiped and ready to go. I had a little trouble getting the phone to take my SIM card, but it turns out that the phone wasn't the culprit - I needed to contact my service provider and give them the IMEI number for them to switch it over. After that, zero issues. METRO PCS USERS - YOU HAVE TO CALL METRO AND GIVE THEM THE IMEI NUMBER IN ORDER FOR YOUR SIM CARD TO WORK WITH THE PHONE.After activation, it was easy to sync up my account and I've had zero issues with the phone in the month or so I've had it. The screen is bright and really responsive, the biometric features are hit or miss - the Face Unlock really only works in the right light at the right angle, and I've had issues with the fingerprint reader, but I think that has more to do with the case I bought for the phone than the actual reader itself.In the time I've had the phone, there's been no crashes of the phone or any apps. The phone does get a little warm during heavy use, but nothing that I've felt I had to worry about. Charging happens pretty quickly with the cable - I'm planning to get a wireless charger soon - and the battery life is exceptional. Even after watching 3-4 hours of Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Disney + and Amazon Prime Video, the battery barely took a 15-20% hit. Power Saving settings, if properly utilized, can stretch the battery even more. I work nights and if the phone is fully charged when I leave, then during the 75 minute commute to and from work, heavy use during two 15 minute and a 30 minute break and a few hours beyond that, it's rare that I I make it home every morning with any less than 40-45%.All in all, this was a great purchase and I feel like I'm getting more than my money's worth.",2020年1月24日 在美国审核,1

Update - April 2020,"I just received my new ""refurbished"" Note 9 and I love it! It did come in mint condition, no scratches or damage to the phone at all. So far playing with the features and setting up have been a piece of cake; pretty similar to my previous Samsung Galaxy 5 so that made it easier to set up. I am awaiting a sim card that I needed to order in order to operate the phone with Straight Talk phone service. But I expect it to be fine.The only thing I wasn't too thrilled with is the new glass design, ""curved edges"". Sometimes when just touching the edge, it takes you somewhere that you didn't want to go to. Other than that it's great. I am appreciative that I was able to get one at a discounted price because I couldn't afford this phone new. So thank you!UPDATE: April 15th, 2020Phone has 2 speakers, one on top of phone and one on bottom. The top speaker keeps shutting off and on, therefore making it very difficult to hear at all times. ALSO, texting photos are taking a really long time to go through. I never had this problem with any of my other phones before. Wrote to seller about getting another one because, other than that, I still love the phone and everything else seems to work fine to date. For now I give it a four star. Will update to a 5 star again if all goes well after hearing and working with seller.",2020年4月4日 在美国审核,0

Good deal,"I was a bit concerned about buying a ""Renewed"" phone, especially after reading several complaints here about the phone not being truly unlocked, and still bound to a particular cellular service provider. Fortunately, my unit came without any such issues. After three days of digging into software, I couldn't find any info that could help identify the previous service vendor, if there was one. My current provider is Tmobile, and the phone seems to be happy to work on their network without any issues.Speaking of software, the phone came with android 9 ""Pie"" OS preinstalled, as well as the usual Samsung bloatware, but that's it. No vendor-specific apps.The package contained the phone (Snapdragon 845 version), charged to half capacity, a Samsung's charger and a noname USB type C cord. It's the bare minimum sufficient to get the phone up and running. The phone itself shows some evidence of prior usage (for which I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5): the sd/sim card door seems to have been opened at least several times, and there is a couple of microscopic scratches on the back near the fingerprint sensor.Not a deal breaker for sure, just a minor annoyance.Everything the phone is supposed to be doing it is doing with gusto. And yeah, it is still a great device. As a longtime Note user, I can appreciate how much the brand evolved over the years. The upgraded S-Pen is so useful in so many ways, I can't imagine how most people manage to live without it. Maybe Note9 is not as cutting edge as it was a year ago, butit is so well-rounded in terms of features and capabilities that it's hard to find any other phone that's clearly superior to it, even among newer ones.The only thing I really miss is the IR blaster, which was present on some earlier Notes. It seems that all phone manufacturers decided to ditch IR altogether, so I don't really have a choice in this regard.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, especially considering the price.",2019年7月6日 在美国审核,0

Good but...,"So the device itself seems to be working just fine. When it got here the phone was gross. It had something stuck on it as if someone handed it to a small child with sticky hands then stuck it in the box.It says it comes with a Sim card Key but didn't, no big deal I have extra.It came with a screen protector on which I thought oh hey cool. I'd already ordered new screen protectors and decided to add the new one anyway since this one had a few bubbles. Well it had the screen protector on to cover the pretty decent sized gouge in the screen. Deep enough that when I run my fingernail over it, it catches. So I wasn't happy about that.It was also supposed to be t-mobile phone but when I turned it on it said ATT but a paper said it was unlocked and explained how to reset the phoneso no big deal.Over all I still like this phone I just felt $250 for it's condition was a bit much. Hopefully it continues to work and I don't have any issues with it.",2021年11月5日 在美国审核,0

Looks and feels BRAND NEW! Came Unlocked and factory restored - Verizon User,"This review should be two fold: one for the Samsung Note 9 and second the quality of the condition of the phone itself from the seller. In the context of it being a used Amazon Renewed Phone, got to say, wow! It has exceeded my expectations on both fronts but most especially the quality of the condition the phone. I haven't detected a single scratch on the screen or edges. Battery life is holding strong - a real improvement from the note 8.Set up was a breeze - just popped my Verizon SIM card from my previous phone (Note 8), signed into google which automatically started downloading all of my apps, media, ect, with all of my custom settings and preferences fully intact, I might add. And bam. Within 30 minutes I was making calls.Now the samsung Note 9. It's an unbelievable phone. A true flag ship - and I couldn't believe it was available at under the $400 price point. I will definitely be doing this from now on - buying 1 year old flag ships on Amazon renewed. It's just an insane bargain for what your getting - one of the best phones ever made, with little to no signs of previous use.5-stars!",2020年3月3日 在美国审核,0

UPDATED - Almost all aftermarket parts broke within a year,"The phone is what I expected for refurbished. With close examination, I can see one ding around the speakers and four pinprick-sized spots of missing paint on the top and bottom edges. None of these irregularities are noticeable at a distance of a few inches and are completely hidden by the phone case. The stylus had a sticky smudge the size of a baby's pinky nail that cleaned up easily with a micro-fiber cloth and left no permanent marks.The phone itself is an excellent upgrade. I had a Galaxy 7 (not a Note) which worked okay but was dated. I had to install and re-install apps to get them to work correctly, so I upgraded to the Note 9. The battery life is MUCH improved. My old device was dead in less than 8 hours, but the Note 9 has gone 24 hours on a full charge and is only down to 51%.I don't know how much I can add to this review to make it meaningful, but if you were like me and looking to upgrade but is sitting on the fence, go ahead and do it. I saved approximately two hundred dollars by buying refurbished, and my refurbished model is like-new with hard-to-notice scuffs, and it a huge improvement over my old device.UPDATED: 1 Year LaterWithin a year the charging port and the camera failed. I took it into a shop to be repaired, and found that all the part that broke were aftermarket. Now, I knew receiving a phone with aftermarket parts was a possibility, but when they opened the device they found missing screws and clear wear and tear on the internal parts. I like the device and it's functionality, but ultimately I'm paying for repairs that cost 50% of what I actually paid for the device. And, of course, all these issues came up long after the 90-day warranty, but all of it happened within a year.Buyer beware.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核,0

Best Purchase Dollar for Dollar,"I have Metro PCS and I was very interested in buying a device compatible with my service features such as wi-fi calling and caller ID. Not to mention full capabilities to utilize network connectivity.I ordered two other Samsung devices, both International versions and I had issues with both (A50 and A70). Both stopped receiving text messages after a couple of days. Tech support wasn't able to figure it out, I read all the blogs online and concluded that international versions are not 100% compatible, hence why they're cheaper.Then I found this, I was debating between the OnePlus 7 PRO and the S10+, but I also didn't want to spend too much. Then I found this Tmobile Note 9, OnePlus wasn't a challenger due to the lack of micro sd slot. It is unlocked. It is a Tmobile phone. (Tmobile boot up) Pristine condition. (Zero blemishes) Battery works as it should. (I had this phone before brand new). It doesn't include an original Samsung fast charger. This doesn't bother me as I have plenty.For the price it's hands down the best phone you can get, this is a flag ship device. Waterproof, expandable memory, 4k 60fps quality video, super vivid screen. This phone was $1000 brand new just a few months ago. I can't even tell its used!

"Great buy, performs like new, but minor cosmetic damage","I bought this product about a month and a half ago. So far I am very happy with my purchase. I upgraded to this phone from a Samsung S7 Active. I was very cautious buying a ""Renewed"" smart phone. However, I was pleasantly surprised.But I want to make clear that the quality of the product could vary from seller to seller as it is not directly sold by Amazon but third party sellers who meet Amazon's specifications. My phone was sold by D'tech Mobile, and therefore your experiences my differ depending on your seller as other reviews suggest some are better than others in terms of quality. But keep in mind Amazon offers a decent 90 return/exchange policy.Anyway, as for the phone cosmetics, this is a used product so I wasn't expecting a pristine phone. The phone had a few small dents on the corners indicating it had been dropped from a short height on occasion. The front and back glass were very clean and mostly free of scratches. There were a few very minor scratches near the edges of the screen that were only really visible if the light hit the phone at the right angle. The S-pen was also in good condition but it was obvious that the previous owner heavily used the pen based on the wear on the writing tip. But the pen was still very usable, and any defect was hardly noticeable. With the case and screen protector on, you wouldn't be able to notice any of these minor flaws. I considered dropping to 4 stars because of this, but reconsidered as it is a used product after all and doesn't affect the overall experience of daily use.Now for the performance quality. The battery life was excellent. Part of the reason I upgraded was due to my previous phone's increasingly poor battery life. The battery life on this phone is excellent even used. I get a full day of heavy use, and two to two and a half days with casual use. The screen of the phone is top notch. The phone overall is very responsive. My previous phone had significant lag between inputs and seeing the action on screen. This phone lacks any such delay. The processor is very fast even with daily use though it is almost 2 generations old now. Side note: the phone is very large. I have large hands with long fingers and have issues reaching all corners of the screen with one hand. Keep that in mind if you have less than average sized hands.Also, several other reviews have claimed that their product was not unlocked. My phone was unlocked and worked on my AT&amp;T network. Keep in mind that this is a GSM phone, and therefore only works with GSM carriers (AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). Verizon and Sprint are CDMA carriers, and it seems most of the reviews that claimed in was not unlocked were for these carriers.TL;DR: Great quality for the price. Don't expect a new product, but rather a product that performs like new. Your experience may differ based on seller.",2020年5月21日 在美国审核,0

"Absolutely great phone, but is still a used phone!","Love my new ""renewed"" Galaxy Note 9 phone, Samsung finally did the Note series right! This phone is fast, has lots of memory,has a large screen, great features and performance,s pen, water resistant,easily expands with up to a 500gb micro sd card.. I've loaded every app I ever wanted into my phones 128 memory and still have 85+ GB. Then I bought a 256gb sd card, (Samsung also),and downloaded another 13gb of Music Cds onto it. Absolutely no lag when scrolling through my CD list. Battery life if also fantastic. So far I've used it all day and all night long and still have 30 to 60 % battery life, at the end of the day.Still not used to the fact that I may not need to bring my charger along with me to work.. The price was great also, but the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars,is because it is advertised as T mobile GSU, ""renewed"", the phone I received was clearly used, the screen has a few scratches and the back and edges also have scratches and pits. Plus the phone was set to AT&amp;T. I was able to insert my T mobile sim card and T mobile came up fine. The only reference to AT&amp;T was after a restart.The startup symbol appears for a sec and then disappears, with T-mobile logo on top.",2020年1月29日 在美国审核,0
Fastest phone I have ever used on Verizon prepay [4.5 stars],"Crystal clear phone calls, voice to text is the best on this phone out of any phone I have ever owned in my life.<br><br>Blackberry KeyOne can choke on it! I've run with Blackberry for the last few years, they did a replacement upgrade when my phone was lost at the FedEx or UPS warehouse, and let me keep it as a backup when it was recovered. So service seemed great, but recently I had to roll back bc my replacement phone has been breaking down. I transferred everything to my original KeyOne only to discover they never actually repaired the phone when it was in for repair. Neither of these phones ever did voice to text correctly.Years ago, I had a Samsung Note 3, which I loved. It was a durable, high quality phone, that didn't slip through your hands. Only problem is, when networks moved beyond 3G, it became pretty worthless. If there was an upgrade option for wireless networks in phones, then I probably would not have stopped using it before this year.Unlike the Note 3, the Note 9 is a slippery phone, so you need a solid protective case. I bought a stack of cases with the phone to try out and my favorite is the Zizo Bolt Series with detachable belt hook. - Brilliant design and durable enough that I feel safe using this phone with that case.. I'll be doing a youtube video on the cases in a few weeks.. look for Joseph Pahrle to watch it.Overall, I'm just amazed by how fast this phone pulled all my apps in. It had every app from my old phone loaded before I walked in the door of the grocery store down the street. It was the fastest upgrade I have ever had in a smart phone. Absolutely love this phone!/!\ update.. photos are very good, but video stabilization is very weak. If they added 5-axis image stabilization to this phone, then it would be perfect!</br></br>",2020年6月3日 在美国审核,0

Great Customer Service- please read details!,"Updated! Went from 1 star to 5 star..<br>So the phone was in excellent condition However it could not be activated on T-Mobile due to it was blocked on T-Mobile because it had an outstanding balance due!Apparently whoever had the phone before owes a balance on the actual phone and on their bill. Therefore it could not be activated so after Many many hours of troubleshooting as to why I could not get signal to make/receive any phone calls or text messages found out I was not able to activate it. I'm sure there is a way to know this before the seller is actually selling the phone.I probably should have gone with a seller that had higher ratings but I like to give everybody a chance because you gotta start somewhere however this was a major inconvenience of waiting for the phone, the troubleshooting and only to be let down that it could not be used.It was a Samsung Galaxy note 9 in Lavender 128 GB unlocked T-Mobile phone. I was refunded upon sending back. I took a gamble again, not knowing it was the same company that I ordered from b4. This time instead of ordering an unlocked T-Mobile phone, I ordered a 'T-Mobile' phone- or so I thought.. This one was a Samsung phone (not locked to Any company) which was still having problems with, wouldn't update on T-Mobile system -although once again in excellent condition... I reached out to seller and said that I needed not an 'unlocked' not a 'Samsung' only brand but a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 9 phone. AsSoon as I returned the phone they sent me out or replacement and I have not had any problems since! No balances were due, it was a factory T-Mobile Samsung phone. Updates are working fine along with network.My problem for not being very specific with the seller &amp; my purchase.. I give them a 5 for Customer Service &amp; a excellent condition of all 3 phones that were sent!Hope this review helped :)</br>",2020年2月23日 在美国审核,0

She only had the phone for 3 weeks so far, but she has no problem with the device.The phone came in great condition, no scratches, and not much notible scuffs. Looks pretty new. The phone is getting 4 stars because it didn't come with an original charging cord, earphones, and some other items that would normally come with the phone. It came with a generic charging cord, original wall plug, the stylist pen, and a metal pin to open the slot for your sim &amp; SD card.The generic cord stop working after the first week.

Exactly what I wanted!!,"After almost 6 months of trying to figure out exactly what kind of one I wanted and watching YouTube reviews on countless phones,I decided to buy the Samsung note 9 and decided to give a try with buying a phone from amazon. I made sure to read the reviews on countless of the options amazon had for the note 9 and settled on this one, and let me tell you I am not disapointed!!!I am absolutely in love and very pleased with what I received.Despite some reviews claiming the pen and charger were bad quality I think they may have since fixed that issue because my pen and charger are both samsung and work fine. The phone is in perfect condition no scratches and even had a screen protector on it. I took the phone to metro to have my service switched over from my old phone and the guy mentioned it had 2 screen protectors on it?

I was able to get it set up on a mobile phone plan with no problems at all. It takes some time getting used to the new type of pen and how to get it out (press to pop it out like a button instead of just yanking it out like older models).

I use it every day to take pictures, draw, use Adobe mobile applications, take notes, write to do lists and shopping lists, make calls, and watch YouTube. I would highly recommend this phone to any artistic person or anyone who loves previous Galaxy Note phones.

"Phone scratched, missing items, seller didn't respond","The phone did not meet Amazon's renewed item standards.It has scratches and mars visible from 12"" away.I am traveling so it's about impossible to exchange it and see if the next one is better, so I'm living with it.Luckily they aren't terrible scratches and I'm not a perfectionist any more.Also, the listing says only the headphones are not included, but the extra pen nibs, nib remover, cover, and usb-c to usb-a connector were not in the box as they should have been.Amazon says all original items are included unless specified in the listing.I wrote the seller about the missing items and received no response.It's not a deal breaker, I'm glad to have the phone. It just out of integrity.Buyer be informed.Also, mine is a Verizon phone. A note in the box said to ignore that and be assured it is unlocked. I ended up with Verizon, so I could not test how easy it was to use another provider.As for the phone, I like the way you can write on the screen without unlocking it. I do this for taking quick notes, especially for dream recall.I am not a fan of the curved edge, it's more trouble than helpful.You can't use a normal screen protector.I still haven't put my fancy $50 curved glass one on because I'm nervous I will do it wrong or it will look horrible.It is a bit slippery and narrow to hold.I like some of the new interface elements but that bixby button is a bit of a pain, getting hit by mistake every day.The battery can last days of you put it in minimal function mode.I had a note 3 before that was having too many problems with GPS and slow speed so I finally gave it up.I'm grateful I was able to get a refurbished upgrade.",2020年2月3日 在美国审核,1

Excellent condition and unlocked.,"Buying used (or ""renewed"") phones is always a gamble, but it definitely paid off for me. The phone I received was indeed factory unlocked, and in even better condition than I was expecting. It had a very, very tiny chip on the bottom corner, a few barely visible scratches on the back, and some slight dirt/scratching around the outside of the USB-C port. The S-pen was also in good condition, and the correct color, but the tip (nib) was worn down a bit. A fast charger and cable also came in the box, both in excellent condition. While the phone didn't have anyone's account or info on it, it had already been through the initial setup. The first thing I did was a factory reset, which should ALWAYS be the first thing you do on a new phone.As for the phone itself... I couldn't be happier! After hearing that the new Moto G Stylus wouldn't have NFC, and a decidedly worse pen, I went for the Note 9. It's probably the best phone purchase I've ever made. Even though it's several years old now, it still beats the 2020 Motorola budget phones in performance for just $60 more (used).It has a headphone jack, unlike the Note 10, and I actually prefer having some empty space on the top and bottom of the screen to host the camera and speaker, as opposed to a hole-punch or notch. The battery easily lasts me 2 days at half brightness, at the highest resolution. Speaking of resolution, there are three options: 720p, 1080p, and 1440p. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in battery life between 1080 and 1440, but I also can't see any real difference in quality between the two. Both options look fantastic. The screen can get incredibly dim, and also incredibly bright. There are two speakers, one on each side of the phone. They sound good, however, only the top speaker is on the front of the phone (facing you), while the other is on the bottom (next to charging port) and can be muffled by your hand while holding the phone sideways. Tons of storage space, plus expandable storage if you have an SD card to spare. NFC (Google pay/Samsung pay) is supported, unlike most similarly priced budget phones. Wireless charging is nice and allows charging even if the USB-C port fails or breaks later on. The fingerprint scanner is quick and works great.The 12-megapixel camera is the biggest negative for this phone in 2020. Good enough for day to day use and even vacation photos, but the real draw (ha) is the pen, not the camera. Secondly, the battery can't be replaced without removing the entire front panel of the phone, which is made intentionally difficult. Not uncommon these days, but a negative nonetheless.The pre-installed Samsung apps aren't too intrusive, and I replace most of them with Google alternatives. The same can't be said for Bixby or the Bixby home. Luckily, you can disable the Bixby home screen, and you can now re-bind the Bixby button to open a different app, or open nothing at all! Facebook can't be uninstalled, but you can ""disable"" it, which is good enough.The S-pen is incredible. I didn't realize just how versatile the pen was before I purchased it, but I'm so glad I did. It has pressure sensitivity, a tiny button on one side of the pen, and even tilt detection! It's an active pen, so it communicates it's position and angle to the phone when held close to the screen, showing a dot or text cursor depending on the context. It can be set to disable finger presses when detected, so you can safely place your hand on the screen while drawing without causing issues! It essentially IS a drawing tablet, albeit quite small. It is far superior to a capacitive pen, like what the Moto G Stylus has, which doesn't have any of these features. The main downside is that the pen has a capacitor that needs to be charged. It's not a huge issue as it can be fully charged in 40 seconds (by simply inserting it into the phone), and lasts 15-30 minutes per charge. - Worth noting, mine did NOT come with extra pen tips (nibs), and the only way to get official replacements is to buy a new pen from Samsung (on Amazon) for $30. (Pen purchase comes with 1 additional soft tip and 1 additional hard tip). Or, you can go for a possibly less-than-quality Chinese replacement set for ~$5. If you are using a screen protector, the cheap ones should be fine.- Some sellers may be better than others. My phone came from CellGuru and they get a +1 from me.- I highly recommend a case and screen protector, as both sides of this phone are covered in glass. I also specifically recommend a glass screen protector instead of film/plastic. My film protector added lots of resistance when using the S-pen, to the point of being unusable for drawing.",2020年2月17日 在美国审核,0

Great phone at a great price,"Phone arrived promptly in absolutely perfect condition. Not a scratch or a blemish of any kind. Only minor quibble was that it only came with a sim card tray removal tool. No charger or charging cord. Not a big deal as we have a bunch of them anyway. Brought it to our Verizon store and they popped in a sim card and it was up and running perfectly. Used Samsung Smart Switch to move over everything from the old phone to the new one. So my wife now has all of her text threads, photos, settings, passwords and apps. Couldn't be any happier. Battery life is ridiculously great and the screen is bright and clear.Edit: my wife was about to throw out the box it came in and guess what? There was the charger and USB-C cord! It's a cheap aftermarket charger that doesn't do fast charge, but they did provide a charger. So this has been a perfect purchase. Couldn't be happier. Kudos to Amazon.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核,0
Quality will change depending on what seller you buy from and how lucky you are.,"Quality and choice of service provider vary greatly depending on the seller but all of them are pretty similar. Look for sellers who have at least a few thousand reviews and are above 85 percent positive for your best chance at a great phone with your choice of service provider. I got lucky and ordered a Verizon but got an unlocked, so it's really all just a chance thing. Also if you get the wrong phone, or a broken one, you can just ship it back and get a full refund within 3 days.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核,0
Recomendado. Solo verifica que te den todas las garantías de reparación.,Hasta este momento el teléfono ha funcionado a la perfección venía en muy buen estado en una caja que no era exactamente la del teléfono pero traía el cargador y el cable tipo c genéricos pero eran nuevos recomiendo mucho este tipo de compras debido a que no me han presentado ningún problema.Sólo tuve un pequeo problema qué no me dejaba Descargar algunas aplicaciones porque me decía que necesito autorización de Sprint o una actualización de Sprint algo así pero lo lleve a la tienda de Samsung de acá en Guatemala y me lo repararon como en 15 minutos dijeron que sólo le tuvieron que correr la computadora y todo listo no entiendo porque si decía que era desbloqueado pero pues imagino que pertenecía anteriormente a la compaía de Sprint en la conectividad no me ha dado ningún problema las llamadas muy bien y el internet también no se calienta no tiene errores y tiene una cámara estupenda la batería venía con muy buen rendimientos y hasta el momento soporta casi los dos días de uso promedioNo No sabría decir si el teléfono viene contra el agua porque no me atrevo a someterlo a esa prueba pero si puedo decir que la reparación que le hicieron es excelente porque no tiene signos de haber sido usado nunca.,2019年12月31日 在美国审核,1

Thank you for the best experience ever.,"I usually never write reviews. I bought 2 phones from here. First one I bought I had to return it in 2 weeks of using it because it erased all the data and restarted by itself. So I had to return that one. I tried a second time and bought a phone from here again. This was my stupidest mistake. I got the phone and as soon as I put my SIM card, my phone wasn’t working because the phone was a stolen or lost phone on the blacklist. So Verizon added my SIM card for fraud. I had to stay on the phone with Verizon for hrs to resolve that problem. I returned the 2nd phone as well...1. First phone rebooted and factory resetted.2. Second Phone was on the blacklist(stolen or lost)3.Think again guys",2019年9月25日 在美国审核,0

Not like new,"The phone that I received had a good OLED with no noticeable image burn. However, the corners of the phone had small dings, the screen glass had a small blemish, and the pattern of a rubber case was permanently imprinted on the back of the phone, which basically tells me it's just a well-cared-for phone that came out of a case and not really a refurbished one that feels and looks like new. I don't know if I can mention which seller I chose to get the phone from because last time I mentioned the name of the seller Amazon removed my review but I think the quality of the refurbished item that you receive depends a lot on the vendor you order it from.",2021年11月18日 在美国审核,1

"Phone Arrived Clean, Nearly Perfect, Activated on Verizon Wireless Without Issue","I've been using this ""renewed"" Samsung Galaxy Note9 for a little over one month.It has worked without any problems and activated on Verizon wireless using the SIM card from my old VZW phone without any issues.I never had to contact VZW, it just worked the way it should once I put in the SIM card.The only criticism I have is that there is a clearly observable scratch on the right side of the screen close to the edge bend near the middle.The scratch is about 3/16"" long and is definitely visible from more than 12-inches away and therefore I don't think the phone was properly classified by the vendor as to condition.There is also a small scratch on the bottom of the phone, but this is minimal and I think it's within the grading classification given to the phone.So, all told I'm happy with the phone and I think I'd buy it again.A previous Note9 I purchased through another vendor went straight back for a refund when it arrived with a facacta power button that was incredibly soft and would clearly fail in short order.",2020年3月29日 在美国审核,0
Keep in mind that it's a refurbished phone tooling marks in rebuilt phones are normal on edges,"I just got the phone and it starts up just fine and everything looks okay with it. Keep in mind that this is a refurbished phone that's why you're getting it for a fraction of the cost oh, so it's very common for a rebuilt phone to have small tool Marks here in there it's not going to be in pristine condition like you got it brand new from the store. But it should work just fine. My friend has this phone and I already know that it's quite fantastic if I have any issues all update my review. The reason why I didn't give a full five stars is because mine did have small tooling marks here in there they're hardly noticeable, but because of my eye for detail I do notice them. In all it is a good buy the phone should work as needed.",2020年6月30日 在美国审核,0
Mostly great phone,"I bought a used Galaxy Note 9 from Celltraders. When I buy used, I always research the seller. You should always do that, ofc, but especially for used tech. As it turns out, I got a great phone but with one detail that's not as bad for me as it may be for others.First off, it was listed as locked to AT&amp;T, so I got exactly what I expected.My Note 9 was almost perfect. I mostly use my phone for gaming, videos, texting, and social media. All of that was awesome. Gorgeous details and screen. Great pics. Good sound out of the speakers. Lots of space because I got the 512gb version. Oddly enough, I rarely use it as an actual phone, which is why it took me a few days to realize the sound was a little tinny.To the person I'm talking to, everything sounds fine. But what I hear is off. It's not soft and it doesn't effect my ability to understand what's being said, but I've heard regular Galaxy 9s and it's not the same. That being said, it did take me a few days to actually use it as a phone and by that time, I'd set up everything the way I wanted. So I kept it and I have no regrets.Had I noticed the issue as soon as I got the phone, I may have tried to return it. But with the price a paid I'm happy.",2021年3月4日 在美国审核,0

High Quality Complicated Flagship,"Several years ago I bought a Galaxy Note 3. Great phone, never had a problem. Used it for several years. Everyone at work had an iPhone and since I work in IT, I thought I should get an iPhone so I would know how to use it. So I reluctantly shut down my Note3 and picked up an iPhone 6s. I really liked it but it was kind of small and somewhat limited- really nice phone overall though. What I liked most about the iPhone (besides the really slick GUI and the lightning cable) was that it was equipped with an NFC. I found I could use it to pay for just about everything. After a while though I grew tired of the whole iTunes thing and my eye began wandering. It landed on a MotoG7 which is really nice for a mid range phone. Runs crisply and reliably and has a lot of MOTO features that give it a very user friendly vanilla Android 9.0 experience. As of late, with the CoVid -19 onslaught, I began not really wanting to use my debit card and enter a PIN on some PIN pad at every store I went to. So I again went looking for a phone that had NFC, a good size with a vivid screen, and wireless charging. Samsung wants premium prices for their flagship phones so I looked for a phone with the features I wanted for the least amount of money. The Note9 fits the bill perfectly! I run my phones on the Ting network so I called them and they sent me a SIM immediately. I ordered this Renewed GSM Note9 and am thrilled with it. It ticks all the boxes and then some. It runs really well and has a very vivid display. The camera takes clear and brilliant pics. And... it has the NFC!! There is quite a learning curve with this phone. Samsung's OneUI overlay gives incredible flexibility, but it feels like it's trying to do too many things, too many notifications, too many reminders. But again, all of those things can be turned off and adjusted as needed. I ordered the phone on a Saturday and it arrived by Tuesday! This is significant since Amazon has been slammed by the pandemic and was showing a 3-4 week delivery window. Overall, great price, fast delivery, fantastic phone (literally looks and runs like new!!). It's good to have a Note in the stable again.",2020年4月9日 在美国审核,0

Beware of the Microphone,"I love everything about this phone except the fact that the microphone doesn't work.Everything else about the phone is fantastic, but if you want to talk on the phone, record sound, use text to speak features or anything of that nature, the microphone is so low you won't be able to.These features work fine if you have a headset or if you're using Bluetooth for phone calls, but it's irritating.Evidently, this is something that is a particular issue with a number of Galaxy Note 9 phones, so be aware of this before you purchase it. If it wasn't such a pain to go back through the process of getting a new phone, I would have returned it and found another one.As it is, it's manageable if you carry a headset everywhere you go.It's also such a large phone that you really need something to carry it in.Since the front and back are reportedly made of glass, please make sure you get a reliable case.Even with the case I purchased, I'm still looking for a clutch to carry the phone, as I previously had a purse/wallet that held my former Galaxy.I am sure I'll find something soon!",2019年11月8日 在美国审核,1

"Excellent phone bought through OCrack, no drama","I love my new (to me) phone! It's been a while since I bought my previous used phone, and some of the reviews had me a bit scared when I was looking through the Note9 listing. I bought my phone through the seller O'Crack and it's worked out. Arrived when they said it would. I was a little confused when I turned it on and a Tmobile logo came up, but the seller quickly responded to my email to let me know that it was unlocked, they just tested it with the networks before sending the phone out. Once I put in the sim card it was good to go and no issues with the transfer. Phone is in excellent condition, with no flaws that I can notice. Again I recommend this seller. And whether your experience is good or bad, make sure to state which seller you bought from in your reviews because it seems like reviews for different sellers were clumped together in this product page so some people had wildly different experiences depending on which seller they got.",2020年8月12日 在美国审核,0

Sprint is NOT T-Mobile when it comes to LOCKED phones!!,"Looks like a good phone to replace my aging Galaxy 11 that has problems processing stuff as of late. Ordered the T-Mobile compatible Samsung Note 9, specifically as a T-Mobile compatible service phone. Phone arrived within a week, so no problems there. Charged it up, and then turned on power to see the screen options. When it did boot up to the home screen, and I saw a Sprint Icon, I knew there was a problem.Although T-Mobile and Sprint are now 1, their phones are not. What was once a propriety Sprint cell phone, is still a Sprint Locked phone, and cannot be unlocked by T-Mobile. Taking it to my local T-Mobile store for help, and having a new SIM card inserted (as mine from my older phone did not work in the new Sprint phone), and trying again, did not help. Showed them my Amazon order, and the shipping box, both showed I ordered a T-Mobile compatible phone, but that was not the case. If you are selling something as a T-Mobile compatible product, you better make sure it is what you are selling it as, and not another brand. That is false advertising, or stupidity, on the sellers behalf.",2021年9月12日 在美国审核,1

Just like new,"Item came well-packed and in perfect condition. Even the protective plastic was still present on the edges and camera. I am not sure if this phone was ever used. Just as promised, the phone is carrier-free and unlocked. Not a mark or fingerprint on it.Everything is in perfect working order; the mic, camera, speaker.Do note: It only comes with the phone &amp; pen, a charging cord, charging block, and sim tool. Not the headphones, pen tips or other accessories that are bundled with a new phone. If you need those items, you may be just as well to buy new. If not, save yourself some money.I use T-Mobile. The phone recognized my SIM card and registered on the network instantly. I did not have to go through any extra hoops to connect to LTE+ or use my WiFi calling. I didn't even have to contact customer service to make sure the phone was properly recognized. Phew! The Android Pie update just got pushed to the Note 9 and it makes the phone feel even slicker.As for the phone: I am blown away by the battery life and UI improvements over my previous Note 5. I am not a heavy gamer but I do put a lot of strain on the phone with research, camera use, and design programs. The phone is large for my small hands, but there are a lot of ways to control the phone with one hand and voice. I am smitten with the remote control pen. I can get shake-free pics of my art and tiny things. The fingerprint recognition is hugely improved over the Note 5, it works every time, whether my hands are cold or have been in the water. The UI has added a lot of features I normally use 3rd party apps to change; such as an overall dark theme and improved Samsung keyboard. I highly recommend buying the app ""bxActions"" Button Remapper to remap the Bixby button to be more useful.I had an issue with the phone's charging block and the seller got back to me within hours to say they are shipping me a replacement. If you have any kind of issue this seller is fast, friendly, and happy to work with you. Would recommend!",2019年3月22日 在美国审核,0

Great phone,"The phone I ordered arrived in mint condition, not a scratch ding or scuff. It had an original Samsung fast charger. Works perfectly.

During the initial setup it asks for the SIM card,after completing it will still show as a N960U1 (T-Mobile is N960U) and will not have the T-Mobile software. However the VOLTE and WI-FI calling all still work on the T-Mobile network with a T-Mobile SIM. Overall very happy with the phone especially the battery life which is excellent.

"Great refurbished phone, ordered from re-cell","To start off, the Samsung galaxy note 9 is a massive upgrade from the Samsung galaxy note 3 that I had before which started dying of natural causes.A few things to note, this is my first refurbished phone, and as of writing this review I have had this phone for about a month.Upon opening the box I did an initial scan of the camera, screen and casing. The camera worked fine and didn’t have any scratches or issues. The screen did not have any scratches or blemishes and had a mirror like finish from a very lightly used or heavy duty screen protector. There were no cracks or defects anywhere except for the lower left corner, like it was dropped from a low height onto a jagged surface like side walk concrete; and the s pen was in used condition. Other than those two defects I could have sworn this phone was brand new never before used (based on appearance)The box from re-cell came with a charging cord, a well-used usb outlet plug (not an issue as it is now my new travel charger where it will get scratched up anyways), headphones with a mic (don’t know the quality as I haven’t used them, it’s just a plus to have them included.The packaging was really stylish it was a satin black with a shiny logo for re-cell. Inside everything was tightly packed to prevent movement when shipping and a note with an email to contact if there were any issues. There were none but it was nice to have the option.A month later after getting used to a new phone I can say there are no issues, it was a risk in my mind to buy a refurbished and based on a lot of review it is a risk. But I will say re-cell was a pleasure to buy from.",2020年2月26日 在美国审核,0

Great but NOT PERFECT,"Considering the price point for a brand new Note 9 is near a grand from nearly any retailer this is a steal!My experience so far has been a good one, Note 9 came UNLOCKED in a UNMARKED box that contained the phone, an official samsung wall adapter and cable.My gripes are that the cable that came with it broke when I used it only ONCE, yeah ONCE. So I want to warn anyone buying this to be careful with the provided cable.Thankfully the phone came with no scratches or any visible damage! The only downside being that the screen is burned in only slightly from whoever the previous owner was or Amazon charging it and leaving the display on (can only be noticed with shades of gray and not any other color).Other than that, the phone runs great!",2019年12月11日 在美国审核,0

Great Initial Impression,"I was skeptical purchasing a refurbished phone because I did not want to find any hint of damage to the exterior of the phone. This phone is flawless.My previous device (HTC 10) was approaching two years old and seemed slow. I chose the Note 9 because I wanted a larger display and did not want to switch to wireless ear phones (HTC 12). A refurbished Note 9 enabled me to purchase the device at a comfortable price.It would be difficult to use one-handed if you have small hands. The features, performance, display, and overall look is impressive. I can't speak to battery life or durability because it is too new.",2018年12月4日 在美国审核,0
Like Brand New!,"Let's start with I got my note 9 from Synergy. After reading all the scary reviews. I kinda expected to be seeing scratched glass or something else.

To me these were not issues at all. I am typing this on my like brand new note 9! I do consider myself fortunate and lucky.I am coming from a note 8 to a note 9. The camera is amazing! Phone is still charging. Was around 4% when it started charging. Not a big deal at all! I don't use the fingerprint scanner so no review about that.

Great Product (They kept all their promises above and beyond) and Great Seller,"I have now purchased multiple phones (note 9s) from D'tech and all of them have had great batteries, arrived promptly and I have not had any complaints.

I use mine with Mint Mobile, no issues there. It does start up saying ""T-Mobile"" as that is who last changed boot images, but after uninstalling the automatic bloatware that comes from t-mobile there is no other persistent reminders.I also had to return one on an error I had made and they were more than willing to communicate with me through the return process.Their prices are within the range of the most affordable for used phones (I got two note 9s, the last note 9 to really have the features I personally need) and although they are not the absolute cheapest phone seller, they have been extremely high quality and thorough.",2021年1月3日 在美国审核,0

"Practically mint condition, unlocked, and works flawlessly!","I got my renewed Note 9 specifically from the seller ReFoned. The phone is basically brand-new, I can't find a single blemish, the battery is great, and it has the original (bluetooth) S-Pen. I was confused about whether or not it was actually GSM unlocked, explained below.As for the Note 9, I'm really glad I picked this phone. Upgrading from a Moto G3, this was quite an improvement. I'm also really satisfied by the S-Pen, I find myself using the phone significantly more often and for heavier-duty tasks, in part because I hate touch screens (oily hands all over the *screen*? insanity) but the pen means I never have to touch it. Plus, I find myself using it to draw pretty often, since the pressure sensitivity is pretty good even through a film screen protector. Two great bonuses about the Note 9 compared to newer models: No notch or holepunch in the screen for the camera, and it has a headphone jack.The rest of the review is informative, in case you (like me) are confused by whether the phone is unlocked or not:When I first put in my SIM card (from an AT&amp;T reseller), I got the notification ""SIM card is not from Verizon Wireless"", and it came pre-installed with Verizon bloatware, despite me specifically choosing the ""GSM Carriers"" version of the phone.However, all I had to do to get my SIM card to work was go into [Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile networks &gt; Access Point Names &gt; Add], and then fill out the APN according to my carrier's information (just Google your carrier + APN to get the info for yours). Now it works fine with 4G LTE, calling, and texting, and I disabled all of the Verizon apps.The phone is absolutely flawless now. I was worried before purchasing, but I picked out a seller that looked promising and replied to clear up negative reviews on their page, and I'm glad I did. I'm seriously impressed by how great the condition is, for way cheaper than buying new and much safer than buying used elsewhere.",2021年8月25日 在美国审核,0
Quality...ish.,"The phone has had no problems at all yet, but the problem I have is the inside of the camera glass is dirty. That's not something you can simply wipe away, I'd have to pay money or return it to get it cleaned. It's fairly annoying, it's not a small amount &amp; it's under both cameras. There's also a substance under the heart reader thing that looks like.. dried milk? but it doesn't seem to effect the camera quality &amp; I don't have the time or money to be able to drop ~$70 to get it replaced, so it'll just have to exist like that for now. Having a good amount of dust inside the camera glass could potentially make the camera inoperable if it tried to focus on the dust or obscured vision. Otherwise it's a note 9, everything is there, really good phone.",2020年3月18日 在美国审核,0

Not original S Pen,The phone came quickly and the overall look was fantastic. After working with the phone I noticed the S pen was not working for air commands. I let the seller D'Tech Mobile know of the issue. They replied with a canned response about reconditioned phones. The S pen is an integral part of the phone unlike a charger or cable. Without a solution the phone will be returned. There are a ton of resellers that satisfy their customers.*Update* The company reached out to me and presented a solution to the issue.

The other complaint is the back glass, which has cracked twice now since I've owned it a little over a month, with no dropping of the phone whatsoever. I don't know if it was a faulty glass from the factory, or if the Otterbox I had on the phone was causing some sort of pressure related stress on the back, but now that I've switched cases I don't have any new cracks to report.

Love this phone.,"I'm writing the review from the phone right now. This is my second Galaxy note s9.I wouldn't have had to buy a second but the first one broke due to my extreme drunk negligence. Otherwise with a solid case this thing holds up pretty well. Everything is very responsive and moves quickly. The camera and all the features are great. The screen is so big I can prop it up on top of my microwave and watch a show or something while I make dinner.

Note 9 best phone for the money!,"Bought the Note 9 512GB with 8GB of RAM for my father and he loves it, perfect match for him! The screen is super sharp and with the S-pen he is able to precisely click on small links and navigate with ease. He isn't a typical heavy Note user, so he gets a solid 2 day battery life. That's emailing, messenger, text, browsing, YouTube, YouTube music, and some daily photo taking.Also the phone is in flawless condition, I couldn't be happier with this purchase, especially for the price! Snapdragon 845 is plenty fast, even for today's standards and the 8GB of RAM allows you to open multiple windows in DeX! And let me tell you DeX is the most underrated feature from Samsung! Wow!!Camera is the same as the Note 10 so you won't be disappointed. Highly recommend for the price!",2020年8月27日 在美国审核,0

DON'T BE PICKY ABOUT THE PHONE,I bought my phone from GSM PROS cus I am sure amazon mixes reviews. The only thing my phone had a scratch on the screen but i put a glass protector on. now its like new and yes it did have pre-loaded app from AT&amp;T but disable them and they disappear. Look if you going to buy used phone for sometimes $300 less then brand new and complain about apps just save for a brand new phone. Also for me it did not come with the original charger or box with accessories. I had an S8 before this so i didn't care they come with the same crap. Although if you really want that stuff go to Mecari or something. they have the original box and all accessories for like $20. So basically just make sure it has any actual S-pen mine did come with one. Also check the IEM number to make sure it a real brand not some knock off one but if AT&amp;T is on it that says something already. Finally just test it with like the service you use and test it with others to make sure if you ever change service it will work there too.,2019年12月25日 在美国审核,0

Given the price, and that this is an unlocked phone, meaning no TMobile bloatware, this phone is 10/10.

I tried to get it unlocked but it was no way to access the phone per my carrier. They suggested that I contact the seller and have them unlock the phone. The phone was not even showing in the database, which prompted them to ask was this a new phone or a resale. I emailed the seller and is waiting on a response.

Activating the phone was a breeze after popping in my sim card (I have Verizon).As of Feb 2020, the Note 9 is still a great phone and on par with current top-of-the line phones. No, you wont get the crazy amount of storage, camera isn't top tier, and refresh rate isn't as good (this is a luxury and perceived performance).

"Refurb purchase... Verizon, Unlocked","I bought another Note 9 that was NOT Verizon and would not worked--I returned. Once my refund showed, I purchased this one that was VERIZON notated in the Listing, and it was unlocked. I had no issues setting it up with Verizon.I bought this phone because I was looking for an upgraded Note phone--mine was failing fast--and I chose this one.CONS:What I didn't notice in time of the (Limited refurb warranty) was that I can NOT get my images off my phone using the cord. I have turned off the preset features, tried all the recommended suggestions and it's not working. I am sincerely disappointed in that because I do take a lot of pictures and I will have to email them to myself until I can get a cloud backup (not using google) to transfer them to my computer. THAT SUCKS...The other thing I'm NOT happy about is when I use the phone on speaker. It is causing problems on the other end of the line and people can't hear me or it has bad reverb. So I have to use a bluetooth headset to make it work.IT leads me to believe this is probably what was wrong with THIS phone when it was refurbished and that refurb techs didn't fix that OR it's not fixable.PROS: it takes really nice pictures, and the rest of the phone works as it should. The battery life is one full day plus, if I'm using it all day to listen to podcasts/audio books while I'm working. I'd buy it again, IF the other two things wrong with it were fixed.",2021年7月1日 在美国审核,0

Microphone did not work.,I bought a reconditioned Samsung Note 9. It was a beautiful phone. The picture quality was gorgeous and I loved the stylus. The phone looked to be in pristine condition. Unfortunately when I went to make a call the person on the other end couldn't hear me. On further exploration I discovered that the microphone did not pick up anything except for occasional crackles. I returned the phone. I was so disappointed because I really wanted it to work. My last reconditioned Samsung from Amazon was fabulous and lasted for 5 years. I think I will try one more time and see if I can get another good one. I won't be buying a Note 9 though because I read online that microphone problems seem to be an issue with a lot of them.

WOW - Amazon Refurb is the way to go!  Just 1 small gripe (charger cable),"I was a little sketched out buying a used phone but figured it was worth a shot since Amazon warrantees your purchase for 90 days AND they're guaranteed to look like new.All I can say is WOW - mine very much did look brand new and I absolutely cannot tell it apart from a factory sealed phone fresh out of the box.In fact, still had the plastic on the front screen and bezels - maybe this is something this particular seller provides but I was surprised... nice touch.It was factory unlocked as promised.All I needed to do was install my VZW SIM and a spare 128GB micro-SD I had lying around and power it on.It was connected, up and running in under 5 minutes.Battery is 95% healthy according to the Ampere app, stylus works perfect and I couldn't be happier minus one caveat - the charger.It's clearly called out in the listing that 'it may not include the original charger' but the charger I received does not really work.It doesn't fast charge at all - mainly because the USB-USBC cable is junk.The wall plug itself is ok (Qualcomm PD 3.0) but the cable sucks and also does not carry data (tested on multiple devices).I ended up buying a set of USBC fast charger cables + a wireless fast charger w/next day shipping, so it wasn't a big deal... but my gripe is that the listing says accessories are 'fully functional'.Oh well - minus one star on that but the PHONE ITSELF and the Refurb program both get a full 5.",2020年11月11日 在美国审核,1

Here it is week number 3 and I have missed several important shots because the camera well stopped working and give me an error message. There is a defect with this phone. Other than that I think the phone has been functional. Due to error messages with the camera I want it replaced.,2019年8月18日 在美国审核,0
Extremely Poor Purchase/Do Not Purchase From This Compnay,Purchased this phone as a Fathers Day Gift for my fiancé. It arrived on time. When he went to the carrier to get everything transferred over it went well until he tried to answer a call and could Not hear the person on the other end. The volume button did not work as well. We tried headphones and you could nearly hear the person on the other end.I feel for the 399.00 plus taxes I paid for the device it should have been perfect. I’m very dissatisfied.I’m very disappointed. And this made me look bad to my other half. If something was wrong with the device it should have been listed. Please do not purchase from this company. This is what you call bad business and something needs to be done about this. I was expecting a good turn out on this purchase and it was a slap in the face,2020年6月20日 在美国审核,0
GREAT REFURBISHED PHONE! AWESOME BATTERY LIFE! VERY PLEASED,"I had a note 8 and didn't want to spend a lot of money to get the next upgrade and so this fit my needs perfectly! I also didn't wanna get into leasing another phone from my Carrier so I'm very thankful to have this!And the switch over was seamless. I put my SIM card and memory card in, downloaded the Samsung Smart Switch app &amp; everything was transferred from old to new! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because after 3 months it started restarting itself with out any warning. My note 8 started doing that and that's when they told me the motherboard was damaged. But I have insurance and I'll use it if I need it.LOVINGThe battery life! So much better than the note 8! I've not tried the finger print nor the face recognition",2020年11月11日 在美国审核,0

"Great Device, with two minus","So purchased this phone on 8/21/2020,Its a great upgrade from my S8+, better battery, camera, ram, processes, and already upgraded to android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 right out of the box, and soon UI 2.5 when released ""Showing that Samsung will support the Note 9 and the S9 and 9+ for those that are wondering for one more upgrade.The one came with everything that was mention acharging cable and brick and a preinstalled screen protector.Cosmetically the phone back and front glass looks brand new, but the side aluminum railing looks worn especially near the charge port and one corner which made me think that maybe phone was dropped at one point previously ""Reason i am giving it a 4 starts a little worn in those charge ports and i would give a 5 but it has significant paint missing near the charge port""Phone was a UNLOCKED model which many people complained about, which a lot of people complained they did not receive make sure you choose fully unlocked not GSM, or any of the carrier and you wont have that issue that many gave a bad review on.i do wish that it did come with the needle extractor for the note pin ""because that is i believe an important feature to have ""another reason i gave it a 4 stars"" now it not coming with any headphones i am ok with because refurbished headphones sounds bad lol.Butall in all i do think its worth the 350-400$ price tag. i mean it is a refurbished phone through amazon after all. If you want refurbished that looks brand new and gets everything go to Samsung web page and pay the extra 120$ if you want, but for most people this is a good price to quality for what you are getting..i would recommend getting this but remember the cons i gave which is the aluminum rails can look worn like mine where the paint is missing ""mine is near the charge port and one of the corners and you do not get the Samsung extraction tool for the pin to remove the tip.""

Overall OK,"Phone works fine. Screen had no scratches and arrived with a tempered glass screen protector on (thankfully because I dropped it the first day while waiting on my case and amazingly finally got to witness one doing what its supposed to and only cracked the screen protector and not the phone!) Shipping was almost three whole business days later than tracking was claiming it would be the entire time up until it showed up.Came missing the s pen which was disappointing,didn't get it until a full week later, but it was a brand new Samsung packaged s pen with the accessories which I was pleased with since those are like $60. there were major scratches that chipped all the paint off around the charging port, idk how or why they did that but I was worried whoever used to have this phone was really aggressive with their usage/care and it'd effect the functionality but other than that cosmetic flaw there's nothing wrong with the phone that I've noticed.. all the built in battery health tests pass very well.. says it had 90% of its battery capacity upon first scan. I still feel like for refurbished i paid too much for a used phone that originally was sent to me half missing and seemingly uninterested customer service but it is what it is. Im satisfied overall, I paid just under $300 after tax &amp; it was free to switch it to my active metropcs service in one phone call, also has no boatyard which I've never actually had on a phone before I love that part!If you're considering a refurbished phone at all might as well try it and save a few hundred bucks this way bc Amazon will at least make it better if its not what you were expecting",2021年7月9日 在美国审核,0

"Great Screen, UI is smooth, bad battery life","I love Samsung products, but somehow, they missed the mark on battery life with this phone.

YouTube, texting, Facebook messenger, Pandora are all things I run regularly on this phone. Battery life on the Moto Power, blows all other phones I have ever had out of the water.The phone is complicated. There are soooo many options that I think a user would not need. There are menus upon menus in the setting screens...It's almost like Boot Menu on a Windows PC. Lots of stuff in here most users do not know anything about, myself included. Voice to text is hard to set up as compared to my Moto G7 as well. Seriously....also does not pick up as well as my Moto phone.Great cameras!Great color!Smooth UI!Fast processor!Headphone Jack!!!! Yes!!!!Artistic Phone- with Pen, drawing, neat artsy stuff you can do with this thing!Did I mention its overly complicated to set up all of the customizations?

Amazing purchase!,"My J7 was quite literally on its very last legs when I ordered the note 9, and I was not disappointed with the phone I received at all. Came in perfect condition, no scratches or cracks, and the screen functions beautifully - as an artist, I really appreciate the pressure sensitivity for the S-pen and the tools available for the built-in sketching app! Looking forward to sketching out some cool pieces.I will say, I was a little thrown off because I ordered an unlocked silver and when I turned the phone on it showed a Verizon screen (I use T-Mobile), but the phone was not locked to Verizon and the technician at my local T-Mobile store helped me set it up on my plan.

Pretty solid phone with no accessories,"Just got it today!!! I already have a note 9, the reason I went out and got this one is because I shattered my front and back glass, and is going to cost me $280 just replace the front glass, and I got this one for $100 more, i consider this to be a better deal. And because i still have all my accessories so it didn't bother me when the phone only came with a 3rd party charger, a sim card pin, but if you dont already have those, you might want to try and find some, especially the fast charging charger, that's a must have. May be I'll update this review after I use it for awhile....Btw, it did come with a little scratch lower right hand corner, where the s-pen is, but I didn't really care, compare with my beat up old phone this is pretty awesome.",2020年7月15日 在美国审核,0

Great device once you get rid of popup ads,I received factory unlocked device with no carrier software on it. I am using Cricket on it in the US and it works perfectly. The unit I received was fully mechanically functional and only had very minor cosmetic damage (completely unnoticeable with case and liquid glass screen protector)I use the phone for heavy duty multitasking and business and it works perfectly for this. Battery lasts me about 16-24 hrsIt came with 3rd party Charger and headphones (no complaints they work fine)My ONLY complaint is the POPUP ADS. However this has nothing to do with the seller or the specific device seems it is common on most Samsung's in this model range.I am a very tech savvy person (I work in the cell phone industry). I could not disable the ads with any built in settings and it was doing it before I installed any 3rd party apps. It was super disruptive. I am very patient but I wanted to smash the phone.HOWEVER I downloaded "AdGuard for Samsung and Yandex" app and have had no popups since.Will keep the device I like it!

Bixby Fail,"Rating is for the phone itself, not the condition. The condition was ""like new"" and I was very happy with that.I even got the OEM charger included in my box.The biggest problem? The most frustrating thing I have every experienced with a phone? Especially on a phone that costs this much?The Bixby button.The physical button on the side, in the middle. Right where your hand naturally holds the phone so you will CONSTANTLY hit it by mistake.After you hit it by mistake Bixby will take over and what you were doing is gone, poof.So normally if you hit the volume key by mistake (which is less likely since it's higher) then no big deal if your volume goes up or down 2 percent from one wrong tap.Hit the Bixby button by mistake and it opens itself full screen and no matter what you were in the middle of is taken away.Samsung will not let you uninstall Bixby. They won't let you disable it. They only (recently) give you the option of assigning the button to another app, but not an option that just does nothing if you push.And if you double tap (thinking you are changing the volume) it will STILL open Bixby full screen regardless of what you remapped to.Since I can't set it to do nothing - whatever app you remapped to takes over and the screen you were on is gone.I've got to where I don't ever do anything in landscape mode because I know as soon as I rotate the phone in my hand I'm going to touch it by mistake.Bixby is no where near as good as Google or Alexa, can't do all the things G or A can do, but they try to force you to use it. Google or Alexa is not forced on you. You don't want it? Don't install/remove widget/tell it to stop listening for wake up. If your stuff is good people will want to use it, should not be shoved down our throat.Some of my other complaints I think are Android Pie's fault so I won't mention those.The camera software I hate, it's constantly changing the brightness even though the lights in the room I'm in are staying the same. Also if I override the software and brighten it up - the brightness will default itself back to normal if you tap the screen where you want it to focus.So the physical camera may be better than was in my old Note 4, the software makes it aggravating, even the editing software for pictures is worse than my Note 4, but this costs double what my Note 4 did.The speaker on bottom instead of on back or front firing means it gets muffled if you hold in on your chest in bed or place it on a charging stand.The headphone jack on the bottom means I have to hold phone upside down so the jack doesn't get in the way/bent over.Good things? It is fast, responsive, battery life is good (so long as you are not playing a game). Charges fast. Brightness is good.I saw in the news the new Galaxy Fold for $2000 also has a Bixby button. So they haven't learned yet and this will be my last Samsung Phone. I've had only Samsung since the flip phone days.You pay this much for a phone it would be nice if you get to decide how you want to use it and what apps you want to use.",2019年4月18日 在美国审核,0

The only two that did accept it was att and cricket. We ended up doing cricket (for cost reasons) and after the sim card came in the mail we had no problems with activation.

Great phone,"The four stars and then five stars may be a little confusing so let me explain. The first phone I received has an OS issue and the only only way to fix it was a hard update but I don't have a samsung experience center near me to do that. Then it shut itself off and asked for an OS. I submitted my return and had my RMA within a day. Very easy. I ordered a different when I dropped that one off at ups. The second one worked perfectly, updated it no issues and is great. Battery still lasts for over a day. I fully understand there may be some quirks ordering refurbed items, and I'm glad they were so quick to take the rma for the DOA os. The second one seemed to come from a different place, it came in a box saying it was refurbed (not the plain white box I got the first time.

Check the Camera,"First phone had a thick scratch on one corner. I didn't want to chance that it was defective and I'd be blamed for a drop, so I sent it back. The replacement phone looked fine, but the camera was defective: fuzzy pictures; could not scan/read receipt/product bar codes, QR codes, or checks for deposit through apps. A couple of days after setup, I tried to use it for a mobile bank deposit - scan in check front and back using camera. Camera took blurry photos. Had to use my S7 Edge, no problem.A few days later I was trying to scan in a bar code through a merchant app that I've used many times. Again, fuzzy view, but this time the scanner didn't work at all. Could not read the bar code. Tried QR Code, no luck. The scanning line kept going up and down not detecting the code.Called Amazon and rep tried but could not fix problem. Amazon transferred me to Samsung support. Samsung rep could not find a solution either and determined the camera was probably broken or there was a settings error. She told me the phone was still under warranty. She didn’t check the IMEI or whatever its called, so I doubted that as this was refurbished, although sold as having a US warranty. But hey, I thought I'd give it a try. She gave me a ticket # to take it to [authorized repair shop] for a free fix or trouble shooting in person. Since I could not exchange it for a replacement with Amazon (only 1 replacement allowed), I decided I’d return it.The next day, I decided to check in with the repair shop to see if I might change my mind, depending on what the tech found since I was still hoping this might be a setting problem and pilot error. Taking that full body case on and off alone was enough to make me briefly consider keeping the darn thing.The [authorized repair shop] rep checked my phone settings and the camera, and determined the camera was broken. They had the replacement part. She checked the phone code with Samsung and said the phone was just out of warranty, but that she could apply for an Extended Warranty and Samsung was pretty good at accepting that. No charge to me. I debated but decided that other things might also be wrong.So, thumbs up to Samsung and the [authorized repair shop]. Thumbs down to seller that tried to pass off a phone with a broken camera. Maybe they didn’t check the camera beyond basic photo taking, but they should have and that alone should have alerted them to a problem.Love the phone, so I bought a new one from Amazon to avoid any ""renewed"" issues and get a real warranty.

"Works fine, but piece of junk cable and not what I would call 'like new condition'","The phone itself works just fine. I personally have had no issues getting this phone to work with my service provider as I use T-Mobile as a service provider and the phone itself was previously locked to T-Mobile.I think potential buyers should note, however, that the product description CLEARLY states that the phone will not work on Sprint, Verizon, Boost, Virgin Mobile or any other CDMA network, so a lot of these negative reviews are from people who didn't take the time to read the product specs.The two issues that I had with this phone were that cosmetically it's advertised as being in near perfect condition and mine had a few major gauges on it. It looks like the previous owner did not use a case or screen protector at all, to be honest.The other issue was that while I understood that I would not be receiving any manuals or original packaging, it was supposed to come with a certified cable, which was definitely was not the case. It did include a cable, but the cable was so bad, that even with the phone running with just the absolute most basic of functions, I kept getting an error message basically saying that it was exerting more battery usage than it could renew with the piece of junk cable I had received. Amazon did agree to furnish me with a new cable, but it would have been nice to have a functional cable from the get-go, as I had to make a mad dash to Best Buy just to make sure my phone would be up and running for the next few days.Not a bad value for the price, but if you buy something refurbished, I guess the lesson is to keep cosmetic expectations on the lower end of the spectrum, and expect a few hiccups.",2019年10月5日 在美国审核,1
Note 9 Review,"Excellent product which offers value for money, loaded with features, works well with the S-pen but the touch is poor with the fingers, you have to press too hard and swipe several times for it to acknowledge the touch or menu you intend to access, initially battery lasted a full day but drains too fast after installing apps and using mobile data.

Happy so far,"Recieved my Note 9 in the color I ordered. Came with 1 tiny scratch on screen (so small only noticed when cleaning to put on protector) and scratches on one outer corner (not large enough to be concerned with). Being a ""renewed"" phone it isn't surprising that it isn't completely perfect. But the physical flaws are minute. I'm new to android so I might not be the best on a tech review but everything so far seems to be working well, the phone was indeed factory unlocked, and was easy to use through my carrier with proper SIM. The battery doesn't seem to last as long as it says but honestly is probably because I'm still trying to figure out how to turn off extra sounds and notifications. In my opinion (as of now, only 4 days with it), seems to be a good deal for price.Oh and I seen that some mention wanting to know where/company reviewers recieved their phones from... the company on my packing slip reads: Tech Excahngee out of Brooklyn NY (as well as) TECHEXCHANGEE. Not sure if the name in the address is a typo. But both of those were on the slip.",2019年12月8日 在美国审核,0

"Beat Up, Used, Dirty, &amp; Broken","For close to $500 after tax, you too can buy a completely used and beat up cell phone! These ""renewed"" phones are absolute crap and is actually a scam. I ended up ordering three of these phones and floating $1,500 out just trying to get a phone that wasn't completely jacked up. the first phone that I received was all scratched up on the back glass and after turning it on and spending an hour getting it set up I realized that the edge of the screen had dead pixels on it. The second phone came and the front glass touch screen was completely scratched up so I didn't even bother turning that on. The third phone came and the back glass along with the front glass was completely scratched up as well. this phone was even showing silver on the bottom where the paint had all been scratched off and scraped. Again I didn't even bother turning on that piece of junk. so in the end all three are going back and I won't be ordering another because all they are are used phones that are completely messed up and they aren't even ""renewed"" at all. Usually when electronics are refurbished they use completely fixed cosmetically and any major hardware issues are fixed. These phones are just shipped right from the previous owner by the looks of it. What a waste of time and money. For $486 these phones should be spotless!",2020年6月11日 在美国审核,0

Inspect The Quality of renewed devices don't buy into the hype of the word renewed,"The phone Works great, battery life is excellent. The one thing I can take way is inspect your device once you receive it, Take it out into direct sunlight and examine it. Don't be fooled by the words renewed nor by reviewers that say my phone was in almost brand new condition, that may not be the case with your unit. Of course I don't expect the device to be flawless but I didn'texpect the condition to be in the words of that famous kiss song(Catch Scratch Fever) On the front and back of the phone. I was going to the return the phone but I lost the Bluetooth SPen, went to Amazon a mistakenly bought the non Bluetooth Spen thinking it was the original so I am not going to defraud anybody by returning this phone without the Actually SPen. I will save up $65 dollars and purchase the pen later, Overall Solid Device if you lose the pen just consider it like a S9 Plus with a boxy shape",2021年5月16日 在美国审核,0

Therefore the phone is pretty much useless for the scope. I am highly disappointed, wasted $350, and now I cannot even return it unfortunately, because the return window is gone.

Note 9,"The device itself is awesome! I purchased this used (or refurbished?) and the phone I received from this particular company was ok in looks but in the package there was a distinct battery smell. I turned the phone on and everything seemed to work fine, however when I went to plug it up, I couldn't due to the batter port being damaged. (Guess that's why I smelled battery?) So, I informed the sender and they told me to return the phonefor a new one or for a refund. I wanted to give them another chance so I opted to get another phone. The 2nd phone came in 2-4 days later, after I sent the other phone back. So far this phone is doing well, only thing about it is the speaker is not in the best shape. On my calls ppl say that they can't hear me well when on speaker or sometimes it will randomly make it where others can't hear me on the speaker. It's not bad enough to send back but I am not sure how much longer the speaker will last. Overall, fairly decent for the price given the features, age, etc.",2022年1月27日 在美国审核,0

Nice phone with identity crisis,"I'm still learning the controls. Have had to turn off chat heads several times. NO means no. The screen, battery life. Camera are great. The sim card ""ejector"" included was a paper clip. No original box or manual but did come with correct charging cable and plug. It has both Samsung and Google default programs to add to the confusion.",2021年4月19日 在美国审核,0

Amazon Customer Service is great.,The phone looks new; but it haves some minor scratches in the screen. I placed the screen protector and you can t see it. I called Amazon to let them know about it and got a discount other than that I am satisfied with the purchase.,2019年9月21日 在美国审核,0

It actually is Unlocked! Whew! Looks brand new!,"Update: So the first night with the phone, the charger is defective. Doesn't keep a constant charge, keeps resetting. I switched to another charger, no fast charge, but it works.I have to say, I was a bit nervous reading the reviews for this seller. So many 1 stars. I just received the phone today. It looks brand new, works perfectly fine so far, and it is Unlocked (Thank god). It was originally locked to T-Mobile. You will see the logo. I have AT&amp;T and when I put the sim card in, it instantly worked. No issues at all. You only get the charger and the phone. No other accessories, which is fine for this price.",2019年4月5日 在美国审核,0
