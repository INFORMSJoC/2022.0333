The perfect phone for 99% of people,"Want the best camera? Want a great looking screen? Want amazing battery life? Want great simple software? Yes exactly, that's why this phone is great for 99% of people. Now if all you care about is specs, just walk away, it's not a flagship, but you won't notice unless you're reading a specs sheet. If your just a regular phone user, takes some photos, watches some videos, strolls through social media pages, and does some emails and web browsing, this is the phone for you, save your money. Some more pros, Google photos back up is unlimited, 3 times the amount of cloud storage for free as apple, and they keep pictures completely separate. If you use any type of voice assistant, you'll love having a Google phone for the best assistant experience. Lots of Pixel only features, screen calling in the US is an amazing benifit. Also, if you want to switch from Apple, this is the phone to try it with.",2019年5月16日 在美国审核
Overall Good Value,"This phone does as well as my Pixel 2XL did, for half the price.Pros: low cost, incredible camera, Google ecosystem, battery life, headphone jack.Cons: slightly buggy phone app, cheaper materials, not quite waterproof, lack of wireless charging, no earbuds included.I was a bit hesitant to risk upgrading, but I'm so glad that I did. I bought the 3A XL in Purple-ish, and the color is gorgeous. The battery life has been great, surprisingly better than my Pixel 2XL. Please note that I did disable some digital wellbeing features within an hour of initial setup, which has increased the speed and saved some battery. The display is nice, and bringing back the headphone jack was a pleasant surprise (I don't know about you but I was CONSTANTLY losing my 'dongle' when I actually needed it).However, there are a few major features lacking on this model vs the 3XL, primarily lack of wireless charging and waterproofing. Another major difference is the materials are definitely cheaper. It doesn't look or feel as cheaply made as say, the iPhone 5C did. The back simply doesn't have quite the same glow as the 2XL or 3XL. I would definitely recommend getting a screen protector on the device immediately before use, as the glass on the front isn't as durable. That said, it doesn't really look or feel cheap, just not built as premium as other Pixel devices.I could probably write an entire page about how incredible the camera is, but it's something you really just need to experience for yourself. Night Sight blew my mind. I took pictures of my living room in nearly pitch black darkness and a) I was able to see more in the photo than I could with my naked eye in the dark and b) it honestly looked like the time of day the photo was taken was about 4pm with the amount of light in the image. Portrait mode on any Pixel is fantastic. I have been asked if many pictures that I have taken on Pixel phones are professional photographs, and I am really not the best photographer.I do feel the need to mention that the phone app still has some kinks to work out, but I'm confident from my past experience with Google that it won't be long before its fixed. I have noticed that sometimes on calls, the phone has issues with displaying contact names on screen when I switch from one call to another. Luckily, there is an option built into the device's settings to immediately talk with Google support live agents via chat. I did this with ZERO wait time. Super helpful!Considering upgrading from an iPhone? I would recommend ignoring other online reviews that advise you against it and just go for it. (Just remember if you have a newer iPhone, make sure to compare features on your current device such as wireless charging first). My inital experience going from Apple to Google (iPhone to the Pixel 2XL) was seamless. Everything transferred via the cord and adapter given in the box. (Minus my collection of Apple music of course, but that's what Spotify is for!)New to Google? The Google ecosystem works incredibly well as a whole. I have Google smart home products in my home, and use Google photos and Gmail/google calendar/g suite etc. I'm amazed every day by new ways that everything works together.Lastly, THE PRICE! A new release, good quality phone at this low of a cost? It's a GAME CHANGER. This was the deciding factor for me choosing to upgrade, and it's absolutely worth the cost. In fact, a phone with this good of a camera at this cost is basically a steal.",2019年5月16日 在美国审核
Great phone; my second Pixel!,"I work in IT and know how to use phones fairly extensively. You should know one thing going into buying the Pixel 3a: it comes with Google's Pixel launcher, meaning that the interface that you're probably use to with other phones (Samsung, Xperia, iPhone, whatever else) is different here. It's a lot simpler to use, and keep in mind if you don't like it, you can download something different from the Play Store.Photos look excellent in my opinion (see my attached photo), navigating around the phone and apps works very quickly, and cell service (T-Mobile) has worked perfectly so far. The phone doesn't have much grip to it, so I recommend buying a case for it.Overall, great phone!",2019年5月17日 在美国审核
Great Phone,"I've been using the 3a for just under a week and am just really happy with it. I'm not one to spend $1K on a flagship phone, but the camera is very important to me, which often is a problem in more budget-aimed phones. With the 3a, the camera quality is spectacular.They've also returned the headphone jack, something I hope to see more of. Either that, or twin USB-C ports.So far, I'd highly recommend this.",2019年5月16日 在美国审核
Say Goodbye to overpriced phones,"The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phon. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a convert! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!",2019年6月2日 在美国审核
Bought it on the day Google announced it,"I've never spent more than $200 on average for a phone.I paid the price with suspect quality, since I mainly bought new Android phones for that price range.Every phone didn't last more than two years, most even started to have issues after a few months (i.e. GPS losing accuracy, charging slot losing contact, etc.)Of course the OS never gets updated so you set yourself up to be hacked on an old, unpatched release.The worst is the camera varying degrees of terrible.So I bought a prepaid iPhone 6 about 1.5 years ago but you know how well iOS runs on old hardware and it will probably not make the jump to the next update.No matter how much I tried to convince myself, I just couldn't buy a new XR, even after I sold my DSLR (b/c I just never bring it with me no matter how good the pictures/lens is/was).However, when Google launched this phone, my last international family trip convinced me that I need to jump at the chance - pictures you have forever, you want the best camera/phone to capture your experiences.Plus, they are offering an insane $250 trade-in for my iPhone and $100 from the Google store credit, plus my company is giving me $100 for BYOD, so the phone is essentially free to me.Ordering was flawless, plus they (I ordered from the Google Store) provided a trade-in kit at the same time.I got it in 2 days after Google announced it.Box was your typical white box, looks almost exactly like a Apple box with color, design, packaging, etc.Phone powered right up.Slight hiccup to get it activated on Sprint in that you can't just move the nano SIM card over, you have to go to a Sprint store and activate a completely new SIM.Also make sure it's a corporate store b/c affiliates don't seem to have these SIMs.I went to Best Buy and they had me running in 20 minutes.Phone is awesome.I got the XL and it's large but for a person who wears glasses it just makes it easier to do things.I know people say it's not fast but I don't game or edit videos so it's plenty fast/responsive.Most importantly, the camera is awesome.Photos are not blurry so far and super clear.I haven't even used any of the special portrait and night options.I'm telling you if a camera can take low light photos that is golden and why I jumped at it.Even with a DSLR it's a challenge trying to take low light photos (do you have the right lens with a large aperture but then you can't have zoom, etc.)It seems pretty fragile so I'm going to get some sort of case, especially since it's plastic and the case is not removable.However, make sure you get a full case and not a case that just clips on the edges.I made the mistake of buying one for my iPhone and sand/dirt got wedged in and ended up scratching the phone itself.The Android OS is quite a bit different than iOS but I'm coping.Can't say it's worst, just different.The best part is the it being a Google phone will get updated for at least 3 years.I have no big input on the exterior design of the outside, really all phones look the same - we have Apple to blame for that.The fingerprint unlock is a huge plus and love it for all my iPads, computers.Very pleased so far (will update if that changes).Since this phone is free to me, I plan to use my $100 Google store credit to buy another Pixel 3a for my wife.She has a 2 year old Huawei Honor 8 that has held up pretty well, aside from every government in the world banning them.Update after 1 monthBest phone I've ever had.Best camera I've ever had bar none, better than any Canon/Nikon DSLR I've had, etc.I've take pictures from moving buses, etc. and each pictures looks like a million bucks...the first time.I've used the camera for some professional portrait quality pictures.Battery life is great.I have had some data disconnection problems but not sure if it's a Sprint problem or otherwise but only happened a few times.I'll monitor to see if it is a real issue.I did end up buying a second 3a XL for spouse and she loves it too, still waiting for my google credit though...6 months updateHere is my update on both my wife and my experience after almost 1/2 a year.So we both have Pixel 3a XL's.Overall, they have been awesome.Camera is awesome, no change.For anyone who just wants to point and click, there is no equal for the price (same as all the media articles).Battery life is great, no complaints.Size is great, especially for reading for those of us who need bigger fonts.So some issues.I had an issue that took a long time to resolve where I was not getting notifications of new voicemails left (using Sprint).Long story short after going to Sprint, working online with Google support, etc. the only way to fix it was to add an app called visual voicemail and sprint hub.This is counter intuitive but it took a huge amount of effort and troubleshooting to resolve.My wife, who had Best Buy setup the phone did not have any issue.She does however have data connection lost issues that is resolved by restarting and I have had it also but not as often.Essentially, the phone stops talking to the Internet.I'm going to try to reset the phone to resolve and then will escalate to Google if it doesn't resolve.Overall, still very pleased with the phones.Almost 1 year updateOh well, I had hoped the Pixel 3a would be rock solid.Over the course of a year it’s developed 2 major issues that require mention.One is it keeps losing data access.The fix is to turn network/airplane mode on/off so there is a quick fix but it’s annoying nonetheless.It happens about 30% of time, usually indoors or in a place that should have access but is maybe a bit difficult.I usually don’t notice it until I bring up a browser or e-mail and it says network unavailable.The other issue is worst.The call volume has become so low that people are unintelligible on calls with bad connections or on speaker phones with low volume.If you search Pixel 3a and can’t hear people you’ll find plenty of threads on their support site.I went through the whole support hurdles to get a replacement but what they do is send you to get it fixed at a contracted store.So the local shop spent over two hours replacing the speaker and I can say that it seems better but time will tell.I’ve never had a problem like this where the volume is so low that you can’t hear people.Some theories are it’s bad hardware others believe it was a bad software update.The repair shop said they’ve had many replace and for some the replacement works and for others it doesn’t.I’m knocking off a ton of stars because a phone shouldn’t die in the first year for any reason, certainly not a near flagship from a top tier manufacturer.I’ll watch it for the next month and if I still have issues I’ll insist on a replacement.My wife whom I also bought a 3a XL also has issues and she uses a headset to make it usable.The speaker phone doesn’t have this issue.Maybe Apple does know how to make phones that are good quality...but at 2x or 3x the cost?",2019年5月17日 在美国审核
This is it chief,When you use a pixel... It kind of spoils you. It's hard to use any other Android after that. Everything is always so smooth and polished. I've had every pixel since the first one and Google hit an absolute home run with this. You get everything you love about the pixel for a shockingly low price. I've had the 3a and 3a XL. Currently typing this from a purpleish XL and it's incredible. The screen is very comparable and even appears brighter than my friends 3 XL. Seriously just buy this phone.

Battery may cause return,"This is my 48- to 72-hour review.I bought this to replace a Moto G4 Play that had served me well but was on its second battery and occasionally locked up on me requiring me to remove the battery to reboot.As I had become a Moto fan thanks to my G4 Play, I was looking at the G7 Play and Power.For a bit more, the G7 looked worth considering, then the Pixel 3a came out for the same price if you take the $100 gift card into account.I read several reviews, and the better camera sold me.I jumped in, taking the Amazon gift card offer over the Best Buy offer.The phone looks good, still fits in my pocket and I can easily use it with one hand.The screen looks sharp and I really like the camera after a day or two of playing a little bit.I still need to learn more about it. I LOVE the call screening feature which I'm not sure is Pixel specific or the operating system.I switched my service over Thursday night but needed a new, smaller SIM card which ATT gave me as I continued service with them.Friday, I was on the phone off and on throughout the day, mostly setting it up, adding my work email and calendar, etc.I also took a walk around my campus with it, testing out the camera on about a dozen photos.By the time I got home from work, the battery was down to 17 percent.17!I had read that this didn't have a great battery, but that it would get me through the day.5pm won't cut it.So, what can you decide in one day?I got up this morning, Saturday, and did some surfing, and played some online games.Now, my game playing is limited to word puzzles and backgammon, not graphics-intensive games.The battery, which was charged the night before, was down to 37 percent before noon.I'm now very concerned about using this during an upcoming trip, or relying on it for work or travel.I really like the phone, but this can't continue.I may need to return it.Is anyone else having battery problems like this.On the plus side, the included charger recharges the phone pretty quickly.But I'm not going to have the time, or outlets, to keep charging it while playing tourist.",2019年5月26日 在美国审核
Google does not stand behind its products,"I bought two Pixel 3 phones both of which had intermittent call audio quality problems and incoming calls not coming in. At times the issue was so bad that even even Google tech support calls weren't getting through despite having a strong cell signal. After spending hours on the phone with Google tech support and exchanging phones, the problems continued. Google refused to stand behind their product and would not provide a refund as we had spent over 15 days going back and forth with them to try to fix the issues and they only honor refunds within 15 days. Mind you, my experience was with the Pixel 3 not Pixel 3a but if you want to take chances with this poor excuse for a phone manufacturer... go ahead.",2019年5月16日 在美国审核
Very impressive for a moderately priced device,"- The OS is extremely smooth.- The camera is ridiculously amazing for a non-flagship device.- The fingerprint reader is insanely fast and in a good location on the back of the device.- The battery lasts throughout the entire day. I'm not a heavy phone user to be honest. I don't watch a lot of videos and I don't play any games at all on my device, however, all of my previous phones would need charged by 6 p.m. on a normal workday.I'm not to the point where I would feel comfortable paying $500+ for a device, however, all of the above are the most important things to me in a phone and the Pixel 3a met the mark for me. I'm extremely impressed with this device and I'm hoping to get at least a few years out of it. Also something that I find really cool about this phone is the squeeze feature. You can squeeze the sides of the bottom portion of the phone to bring up Google Assistant rather than using a voice command.At first I wasn't a huge fan of the Google search bar being fixed to the home screen, but i can use it to search my apps and other setting on my device. I enjoy this because I'm able to remove all icons from my home screen so that I can use widgets instead.For those specifically looking for carrier information. I am using this device on Metro by T-Mobile (MetroPCS). The service I receive with this device far exceeds my previous two devices - Samsung Galaxy S8 and Moto G5 Plus.",2019年10月18日 在美国审核

Pixel 3a best all around phone at the best price.,"So much has been said about this phone, so I will try to boil it down. I have waited over three weeks before posting my thoughts.<br>1. In December 2019 for $299 pre Black Friday limited time offer, no phone has a better camera and software combo. If you double the price, still can’t name a new phone at this writing that can beat it. Google just added the ability to photograph the stars like the pixel 4. This mode is automatic. The phone needs to be on a tripod or otherwise completely still for the long exposure mode be enabled.2. Less talked about, this particular version G020G US version has band 71 for TMOBILE, their new 600mhz band. This band will do more to make sure you get actual coverage rather than try to get you some high speed. Yes this phone supports all the major carriers, and having that rare (at this time) band 71 is nice.3. So other positives, Oled screen, always on display, be the first in line along with the essential phone to get bug fixes, security patches at the newest version of android.4. Headphone jack, let’s all say that one more time headphone jack.5. Dual speakers, one bottom firing the other is the ear piece.6. Stock android, no skin just the basics.7. Battery. Not in the pros or cons. It’s fine, not the crazy 14 hour heavy use champ, but it has never come up short for me.Some cons.1. Screen is that tall skinny aspect ratio. No my favorite. On the plus side easier to hold and reach all of the screen without issues.2. Because this budget budget phone is missing the dedicated image processing chip it takes longer to process images. You can still fire off as many as you feel the need to but to see the finished image, there will be a short wait. The lower the light level, the longer the wait. Not a deal breaker because the images are usually just so good.3. Screen is just a hair warmer than I’m used to. I have adjusted to it, but I mention it because you cannot adjust warmth.4. Speakers are on the weak side. Sound is even, good quality just not very loud.5. Notification sounds are too soft.6. Camera has no manual controls or any real controls. When the camera chooses the wrong white balance I cannot do anything really. Sometimes changing my aim slightly will cause the camera to choose something better but that doesn’t always work. Also a big pain. There is a big crop in video mode to aid stabilization so your field of view will get really tight. I don’t like this all all. It’s one of those things that isn’t mentioned often. I looked at lots of reviews both written and video and don’t recall any mentions.I’m sure I missed a lot, these are just some things that come to mind over the past few weeks.</br>",2019年12月10日 在美国审核
Compared to Pixel 3,"Basically Pixel 3 lite version like how iphone XR si to iphone X or samsung Galexy s10e is to Samsung S10, but at a more affordable price.Here are the list of differences compared to the Pixel 3 (original).1. Camera.Best camera at this price pointSame rear facing camera. One of the best, if not the best smart phone cameras out there in the market.Camera hardware is toned down. If you use 3rd party camera apps you may not get HDR+Takes a few seconds longer for post processing to finish; not an issue unless you take multiple pictures in quick session then try compare themThere's no duel camera on the front. So no wide angle selfiesUnlimited storage at high quality with Google Photos to cloud for 3 years2. Plastic BodyDoesn't feel as preinum, but may not feel the urge to buy a case for it right away.3. Has a Headphone JackCan use wired headhphone on it with a 3.5mm headphone jack. No adapter needed.Has Bluetooth 5.0 for those who have switch over to wireless lifestyle.4. No Pixel BudsUnlike the original, does not come with Pixel Buds out of the box. Not even wired headset5. No Wireless Charging6. Longer Battery lifeHas larger battery and faster charge time than orginal7. No Front Facing Speaker.Instead speakers are on the bottom of the phone. Makes it less emesrive/loud when playing audio from device.8. No water resistanceCareful not dropping it in a pool or toiliet9. Has mid teir processer: Snapdragon 670 with 4GB RAM. Good enough for casual use. If you play a lot of mobile games or multitask with duel screens, you may see notice some slowdown if you're used to high end smart phones.10. More carriers selling phone. Original only sold at VerizonLike other Pixel, Google phones; it is an unlocked phone so can use it on any carrier.11. Missing 3rd micLower audio pickup and noise reduction12. Larger size physcially than Pixel 3 despite it having lower specs13. ScreenHas OLED screen vs LCD like the original, but not as bright.443ppi original vs 441ppi for 3aHas dragon trail glass vs gorillia glass. Both are different manufactures with different names. Durablity should be almost the same14.

The best of Google finally at a low entry cost,"I purchased this for my wife who's essential phone had an unfortunate date with a swimming pool. I upgrade my smartphone every 8-12 months so I'm no stranger to using different phones, ranging from Google phones like the galaxy nexus, to the Nexus 6p as well as a Galaxy Note 3 and lately I've been on a good run of oneplus phones.My wife likes to hang onto her phones and also wants a smaller form factor. The pixel 3a is a welcomed entry in the smartphone world. Even though I've never used a Pixel 3 I have used a pixel 1 and 2,and I can say this 3a feels as fast as those phones. Sometimes specs aren't the while story. Regardless if this doesn't have top specs or a 4k display it feels premium, it feels fast, it looks great, and the camera is top notch.If you are on a budget this should be your choice. Nothing else comes close to the 3a's quality for $399. Pure Android is a treat if you've ever esperienced a horrible UI like LG's or Samsung, then you are missing out on pure Android. 3 years of support promised from Google is perfect as most people will replace their phone every 18-24 months but if you want to hold on just a little longer, Google has you covered.",2019年6月17日 在美国审核

this is basically a flagship phone for $400,"On paper, the specs of this phone seem subpar. But honestly, it doesn't really matter because when you have this phone in your hands, it's extremely fast and responsive. I'm guessing this is due to some very well done optimizations on google's part.The camera is the best camera I've ever had in an android phone. The finger print reader works without error as long as my finger is dry. I tried to use the finger print reader after I got rained on for a bit, and that was the only time that it didn't work. In terms of battery life, If I leave location on, it does last me the whole day unless I'm using it quite heavily. However, I can make the battery last all day under heavy use if I simply turn off the location/GPS when I'm not using it.The little extra things about the phone are awesome as well: I love that there can be a song playing somewhere, and then I can turn my phone screen on and the song name will be there at the bottom of the lock screen.

Best budget phone for the every user!,"A lot of the budget smartphones have to sacrifice somewhere. Pretty much all of them will have sub-par cameras, decent at best displays, and of course loads of bloatware. This makes finding a nicely priced phone for my mother a bit of a challenge because she is always after the best camera with a nice display but couldn't care less about the specs. The Pixel 3a shakes things up by going against all other budget phones; it has identical camera quality to the flagship Pixel 3 (in other words, the gold standard) a full HD OLED display and absolutely no bloatware to find! Instead the Pixel 3a forgoes the flagship processor, and and what I like to call ""XL cupholder add-ons"" (features that no one would ever say no to, but aren't necessary in a phone), so no official IP rating, no wide angle selfie camera, no wireless charging or glass back, and only one of the stereo speakers is front facing. I myself would find myself gravitating more towards OnePlus phones where performance is prioritized over things like camera quality, but for my mother and most other people out there who just want a good camera and a beautiful display, there is no better phone!<br>TL;DR best phone for anyone not absolutely obsessed with specs like me and uses their smartphone camera frequently (so 80% of the population)</br>",2019年6月30日 在美国审核
"A segment killer. Hands down, the best full-featured smartphone you can get in its price range.","OK, this is gonna be the easiest phone review I've ever written:With the Pixel 3a, Google has redefined the mid-line smartphone. While there are somewhat better phones available for much more money, and worse phones available considerably cheaper, this is a smartphone that will satisfy the vast majority of users, available at about 2/3 to 1/2 the price of anything even remotely worth considering as an upgrade.Usually I save the punchline for the end, after a long look at features and quality. But in this case, I wanted to lead with conclusion, because it's just so obvious.There have been about a billion articles written that list the basic specs of this phone, so I'm not going to repeat those here. But I will summarize just what makes this phone so appealing.I have also attached some photos to put a point on some of my comments. In particular see the comparisons of how the camera on this phone does in difficult low light ""dusk"" conditions. It blows away the comparison cameras on phones like the iPhone 8 and Motorola's previous flagship the Z2 Force. (And new flagships aren't that much better).Let me start by saying that what people want in a smartphone, no matter what nonsense the hardware manufacturers are trying to sell, are the following:A) Good phone receptionB) Full support of the major carriersC) Fluid experience (apps open quickly, run properly, no unnecessary heavy OS tweaks or bloatware)D) Sufficient integrated flash storageE) A good cameraF) A screen that's ""big enough"" and that looks goodThat's it. Sure, there are niceties like a fingerprint reader, waterproofing, memory expansion, and whatever they're hyping this year, but if you meet A-F, you have phone you'll be happy to use.The Pixel 3a meets all of the A-F criteria. In a head-to-head with a thousand dollar iPhone or Samsung phone would it win? No. But as Voltaire said ""don't let the best be the enemy of the good."" Especially if that money is coming out of your pocket.Running down the specifics:A) Phone Reception. The Pixel 3a gets good phone reception. In the era of Smartphones, that often gets overlooked. I've had expensive feature-laden smartphones that could barely maintain a signal once you left good signal areas. The Pixel holds its own. Is it as good as my Motorola Z2 Force (Motorola is known for particularly good reception)? No, not quite. But the difference is small enough to not worry about.B) Full support of the major carriers. One thing that's really nice about the Pixel 3a is that it works PROPERLY with all the carriers. A lot of ""unlocked"" phones will work with the various carriers, but will fail to set up properly to run the proprietary apps that belong to the carrier. For example, I have had numerous unlocked phones that did not correctly set up with a T-Mobile SIM (my carrier) to support their voLTE (phone+data) or voice messaging services. The Pixel 3a just...works...Put in your carrier's SIM card and it sets up the necessary functionality for your carrier (at least in the USA).C) Fluid Experience. Yup, it's plenty fluid. A lot of people have bemoaned that this phone is based on the Snapdragon 670 processor, rather than the Snapdragon 8x5 series processors found in flagship phones like the big brother Pixel, the Samsung S10 and so on. But a lot of that is ignorant processor envy. The reality is that in day-to-day operation, the 670 offers performance that would be difficult to differentiate from the 8x5 series. Sure, if you run synthetic benchmarks, the 8x5 looks better. But if you are the typical user who uses your Smartphone for email, surfing, maps and the occasional game, you are not going to know the difference--especially since Google has done an outstanding job of tuning the Android backend to maximize performance with the 670.D) Sufficient integrated storage. Yup. You get 64Gb of storage. That's not enough to set the world on fire these days (flagships mostly start at 128Gb). But it's enough to store just about everything and anything you should be storing on your phone. If you are the kind of person whose phone is running out of space because of too many pictures and videos, look into Google Photos, where you can upload your photos for free and get them off your phone.E) A good camera. Yes!!!! Not only a good camera, but within a hair's breath of the very best camera you can get on a smartphone. The very best camera award currently belongs to the big brother Pixel 3, which has a second lens for some special effects, and a Pixel Visual Core co-processor which means that photos process a little more quickly. But in terms of just quality, the Pixel 3a has as good a camera as ANYONE, and a MUCH better camera than most, including the flagships from brands not named Samsung or iPhone. It's also arguably better than their flagship cameras, although it's not worth going down that rabbit hole right now. What makes it so good? OIS (optical image stabilization) that really works. Accurate colors. Low light performance (in something Google calls ""NightSight mode"") that is nothing short of amazing. (See the pictures I've attached for proof). This is the first time in smartphone history that a camera that could legitimately be called best appears on a mid-line smartphone. That's amazing.F) Big enough screen. Good enough screen. I'll start with good enough. The screen is bright and readable even in sunlight. It has 2220x1080 resolution, which is not the best of any smartphone, but it's very good, especially given the moderate screen size of 5.6"". No one who isn't into specs or very very niche apps will be unhappy with the resolution. Is it big enough? Well, that's gonna come down to taste. What I can say is that this is a perfect size for one-handed operation. If you are one of a very large number of people who bemoan the days when you could actually operate your smartphone with one hand, the size of this phone is probably your sweet spot--at least of the currently supported sizes among leading Android manufacturers. If, on the other hand, you're a more-is-more person who wants as much on the screen as possible, then you may be better suited to the Pixel 3a XL (exact same as this phone, except a bigger 6.0"" screen), or the Pixel 3 XL (6.3"") or maybe one of those ""what the heck is that tablet you have on your ear"" things from Samsung. But for the vast majority of people, the size of this phone is going to be quite satisfactory.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So this phone hits all the important high points. But, wait, there's more:A fingerprint reader (located in the center of the back) that is very responsive and accurate.A headphone jack (!!!) Yes! They brought the headphone jack. Why they ever got rid of it is a mystery of ""hey Apple did it maybe we should too"" proportions. Since 3a seems to be the ""people's Pixel"" it makes sense they'd bring back the jack. That means you can use your old wired headphones, if you didn't already shift to Bluetooth. And if you shifted to Bluetooth, this phone can work with those, too. Options...what a concept.4Gb RAM. One way a lot of phone manufacturers cheap out on their mid and low line phones is by providing less than 4Gb of RAM. 4Gb RAM is the sweet spot for Android. You don't really need any more. But if you have less, you can find your phone bogged down when you have multiple apps open. So it's nice that the Pixel 3a has a flagship-worthy 4Gb.The battery is 3000 mAh, which a few years ago would have been jaw-droppingly great, but is 15-25% less than some of today's flagships. That said, because the screen is smaller and the 670 processor is less power hungry, you actually get good life out of that battery. I am pretty hard on my phone, and tend to get a day out of a full charge, although by the end of the day I'm in that stressful &lt; 20% range. I did a power consumption when just sitting around test, shown in the pictures. I got about 64 hours of use out of it in that case before it hit 10% and went into deep battery saving mode. That's not bad at all.Supports fast charging. I was able to fully charge the battery from 10% back to 100% in a little over 1.5 hours of fast charging. If you just need a top off, you can get a double digit increase in the charge with just 15 minutes. (The last bit of charge to 100% is always the hardest/slowest).Little niceties like squeezing the sides of the phone to open Google Assistant, and double tapping the screen to unlock it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, so at this point you may be wondering what are the downsides of this phone? You've got a grand burning a hole in your pocket? Can't I provide some reasons to waste it on a double priced flagship?Well, here are the downsides:This Pixel 3a does not support wireless charging. This is a drag. I love wireless charging: I set my phone on a wireless charging stand next to the bed and in the morning it's fully charged. I'm sad they didn't include wireless charging here.The Pixel 3a is not waterproof or certified water resistant. If you are the type of person prone to dropping their phone in the toilet or the pool, this may not be the phone for you. I am not that kind of person, so that's OK with me.There's no memory expansion. You get your 64Gb and that's it. There's no memory slot to expand the memory. I don't think this is a deal killer unless you keep your entire song library or movie collection on your phone. But it's worth noting.The phone is made of plastic. It looks pretty, but it's plastic. Upside: It won't break like a glass case. Downside: It's plastic. Somewhere, sea life just shed a tear. But once you put a case on it (and who doesn't use a case?) what difference does it make? It's like all the nonsense about whose phone is 0.001 mm thinner. Who cares? The case makes that irrelevant.The phone has only 1 front facing speaker. That means mono. But before you boo-hoo, when is the last time you got the sense of great stereo separation from your flagship phone with stereo speakers? Maybe never? The speaker on the 3a is plenty loud and to me that's far more important than whether I might every be able to hear a stereo signal from it's (like all other smartphones) tinny speaker.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To summarize, there is a lot to like, some to love, and precious little to bemoan about the Pixel 3a (for me, probably the biggest moan point is the lack of wireless charging). A phone like this would have been a flagship a few years ago. Now it is within shouting distance of the relevant feature set of this year's flagships. And it has a better camera than almost all of them.If you really want to save money, and you're willing to give up important features and experience, then you should look at the low end Motorola phones, which offer real value in that segment. If you have double the money the Pixel 3a costs and you just have a burning desire to throw sense out the window (or you really have to have a bigger screen), then look at Pixel 3 or the Samsung flagships or (if you must) the iPhone flagships.For everyone else, the Pixel 3a is where it's at.",2019年6月28日 在美国审核
"Great phone! Minor downsides, lots of upsides.","Overall I love my Pixel 3a! I've had it for almost a whole year and there are a lot of things I love about it. The fingerprint reader works great, the camera is awesome (my favorite feature) and the screen resolution is really nice. The 3a has a gyroscope so you can download a compass app and it will work, and you can view YouTube 360 videos. GPS and Maps works great. Has NFC reader so you can pay with the phone and write custom NFC cards, read NFC cards, etc. Awesome speaker for the phone price. Can connect to 5G internet.Downsides: in order to screen mirror, a Chromecast device is required. Won't cast to any other device unless you're doing Netflix to Netflix or Youtube to Youtube. Pretty disappointed about that.Not very waterproof at all. It doesn't have an IP rating. If you want to protect it especially at the beach or pool, buy a waterproof case.Vibration isn't especially strong, however the sound is nice and loud so it hasn't been a huge issue for me.No wireless charging.No face recognition, at least not that I can find.Other notes:Phone is a bit taller and skinnier than I'm used to but I've come to like it because of my small hands. Also if you want it to fit well in your pocket I recommend getting a slim-fitting case.",2021年2月20日 在美国审核
A great phone so far...,"What I wanted with this phone was to move off my old device smoothly and upgrade to a new phone without the need to go to the Verizon store and without spending $1000 on a flagship model.I received the Pixel 3a and started to set it up.Part of the setup was to connect the phone to your old phone and bring over apps and data which is really cool.Contacts came over automatically from Google and when I pulled the sim card out of my old phone and placed it into the Pixel 3a, it just worked.Period.It was the smoothest transition I have had.The Pixel 3a is slightly 'taller' and 'thinner' than my old phone (an LG G5).The phone is very easy to use and the display is awesome.The camera appears to be excellent as well which was one of my priorities.I have had to spend some time getting used to all of the new stuff and I have been playing with it this morning for 5-6 hours.The battery life is still at 93%.I really like the look and feel of it.I also liked the fact that this device could be brought over to another carrier if I chose to switch.The phone is CDMA and GSM compatible so it's truly unlocked and not tied to any specific carrier.It was new in the box, fully sealed and in perfect, brand new condition.For those looking for a flexible, unlocked phone with great features without spending a ton of money on a flashy, high-end model... this is your phone.",2019年11月12日 在美国审核
Coming from Huawei P20 Pro,"My wife got a Pixel 3 when it first came out last year.I liked it but didn't think it was worth the $1000 price tag.I was using a new Huawei P20 Pro that was known as the camera King in the smartphone game with a triple camera including a 40 MP sensor and unbelievable low light pictures.Then my wife got her Pixel 3 with it's one camera making my pictures look, well bad.I finally decided to pull the trigger on the Pixel 3a after a lot of consideration.At the time of purchase, the regular Pixel 3 dropped to just $499 in price.I thought about going with that but decided that I don't use wireless charging, liked the idea of a plastic phone over a glass back since I like to rock my phone no case, liked the headphone jack, and don't really care about the wide angle selfie cam.The things I do like about the regular Pixel 3 are the better processor, dedicated photo processor, and free photo storage at full original quality.But decided to go with the 3a and save $100.So far, I don't regret the purchase.I still have my P20 Pro as a back up phone too.The camera on this does absolutely blow that one away which makes it worth it to me as that is my biggest priority and I'm guessing it is most people's as well.One thing is apparent right away to me and that is battery life.Yes, it charges fast and I pretty much have access to chargers everywhere I go (home, work, car, etc) but my P20 could go two full days on a charge.I could leave for work at 100% and come home 9 hours later at 92%!It was nice.This thing lasts way way shorter.It has gone 100 to 60 in only a few hours with very light use.But I love the display, the speakers are some of the best I've ever heard on a phone, the camera is literally stunning, and I like the simplicity on styling and operating system.It gets a 9 out of 10 from me and that is because of the camera and price.Update 1:After using for a few days still loving the phone and found out a big factor on battery life.I had the ""Lift to Awake Screen"" activated on the Always on Display.After turning that off, the battery life has gotten quite a bit better.I didn't like that anyways because the screen would constantly go to my lock screen just holding the phone in my hand or pocket.You could also greatly improve battery life by turning the Always on Display ""off"" completely but I really like it on.I am really liking the stock android OS and I forgot to mention, my phone updated to Android 10 on the first night, one day after the release.You can't beat updates like that!And my 3a hasn't had any of the ""pixel problems"" that many other Pixel 3 owners faced after going to Android 10.",2019年9月7日 在美国审核
300% INCREASE IN MY PHONE BILL BECAUSE PIXEL 3A LACKS (BASIC) MOBILE DATA -&gt;WIFI AUTO SWITCH FEATURE,"#1 REASON NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE:It (and other Google Pixels) doesn't auto-switch from WiFi to mobile data when you leave the house OR auto-switch from mobile data to WiFi when you return home.This means that when you leave the house, you have to remember to turn on Mobile Data, and when you return home, you have to remember to turn Mobile Data off.If you don't, the phone will keep using your Mobile Data *even if you're connected to Wifi and have full Wifi signal!*I have Google Fi for phone service and pay for data by the gig, and the lack of this feature on the Pixel phones has caused an increase of over 300% in my phone bill.SHAME ON YOU, GOOGLE!!!#2 REASON NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE:I suspect Google is wiping negative reviews on this phone.I have previously written an amazon review on this phone that followed all guidelines, however it isn't showing up and amazon never notified me that the review was taken down.PIXEL ALSO LACKS OTHER FEATURES* No scrolling screenshot* Insufficient storage space* Can't add storage space via memory card* Low battery life* Camera is as good, but the camera on my (old) Samsung S7 was just as good and had more and better camera features.Pixel only scrolls in one direction to take a pano shot.GOOD* Camera is as good, but the camera on my (old) Samsung S7 was just as good and had more and better camera features.",2020年3月3日 在美国审核
Update,"Well , after just a month of using this phone, a loudspeaker problem just developed, distorted noisy sounds over calls or anything media. Really sad, I thought I could like this phone. After reading reviews, this seems to be a common problem with no fix. So am stuck. I asked for a replacement but what's to say I won't have the same problem. If I knew this, I wouldnt purchase so if you considering buying wl reconsider.....I really do like this phone and it would this will be the first time I will be using a google pixel phone.Have not being one to want to join the craze that comes with new phones , I like something that's not too out there and this phone seems to be it, meets standard and at an affordable price. I know many people use it too but well...it's just unique.The features are great, it fits my hand well, the camera is Soo good too and for the price because other budget phones tend to lag on camera. I am really satisfied with my purchase.I really do hope it stands the test of time as am tired of changing phones...would love to use this one for a good time. My only worry is the storage, it's 64gb and no SD cardslot but I want to believe it's enough at least, am a basic phone user so not much apart from pictures and a few apps so I hope I don't have to deal with memory card full popups in the future like my last iPhone... whew!!! I was so over iphones at that point, switched to Android and used a couple but wasn't really satisfied with the last Samsung I used.Did I say I love the phone, oh yes I did. I rarely review anything I buy but I had to on this one...so far so good am satisfied. If ever , I have to change my phone again which I don't want to at least for a good while,I will definitely be getting another pixel so I hope google keeps us the good work and keep making phones that meet standards to a good level and at a good budget price.You know that saying that goes like good things don't really need to be advertised to proof the worth, this is an example because I never knew about this phone or saw adverts on it or maybe it's just me but well....this phone is a good buy.I really hope I don't have to come back and say something negative about this purchase, I just want to continue loving it. Well, I hope they would produce more pretty cases that fit this phone, not like they aren't good ones but am a bit picky with phone case, I don't like them too feminine and all shiny or pinkish but I also don't like them too masculine and dark so well that's on me but I was able to find one or two that am willing to use.",2020年3月4日 在美国审核
Worth my money so far,"Pretty satisfied with phone so far. Battery life lasts me the whole day. It feels pretty good in the hand. The screen display has three settings for color: natural, boosted, and adaptive. Adaptive definitely brings out the colors and liveliness in display, but when colors are already bright, it begins to look too saturated. Natural looks a bit too dull for my liking so I settled for boosted. But you could decide what fits you best. I love how there's many options for people who may have special needs. I personally don't use them but it's a nice feature to have because it makes me feel like Google cares about their customer's convenience and needs.The back camera is beautiful even without the Google camera processor, but the front camera is a bit different. Without good lighting video calls may appear blurry. On other apps requiring the use of the front camera, The quality may look a bit too sharpened. But again, it's not a big deal for me. If you just use the preset camera app, the processor will make your photos look supreme! I almost believe that I was a national geographic photographer for a second! The night camera setting is phenomenal!I'm a simple phone user though.",2019年8月1日 在美国审核
Flagship phone camera at mid-range price.,"I've always purchased used phones because I didn't need the latest and greatest processor, but always wanted a nicer camera.See, the cameras on midrange phones tend to never be as good as the flagship phone's cameras of even a few years back. So when the Pixel 2 was out, I was still on my Moto X. Moto X was older, yes, but still had a decent camera for the time and an OLED screen.Finally today we have the option of the Pixel 3a. A device with an OLED screen, IMO the best cellphone camera on the market, and a midrange prcoessor. This bringing the price down to a point that I saw it as entirely afforable.Headphone jack, no goofy notch, but still doesn't look severely old. It's honestly a return to the Nexus style model, and I'm in love with it.The only negative reviews I see are people complaining that it doesn't have all the features of the $800 phone. Of course it doesn't! Otherwise it would cost more.",2019年5月29日 在美国审核
Best features in an Android for under $400,"I was an early adopter of Google's phones when they came out with the Nexus line. Unfortunately, I never bought a Pixel because Google chose, at first, to compete with the expensive flagship phones that cost $800 or more being put out by Apple and Samsung every year. That has since changed, and I'm a welcome convert back to the Google fold.My last phone was a Moto Z Play, which I purchased for $400 about three and a half years ago. I loved the battery life, but the bluetooth died almost entirely when the phone was two years old, and the camera was never great. By the time I had had it for three years, I couldn't run more than two or three apps without experiencing issues with crashing. Likewise, if I opened more than 50 or so tabs in the web browser, it would typically crash. It's a relief to no longer have those issues.COST: I purchased this phone when it was $320, so I already saved $80 over my last phone purchase. This phone does everything you need and looks sharp. It doesn't have 5G, but the amount of features you get for less than $400 more than justifies the price.CAMERA: Google has really outdone itself with the Pixel 3a's. The camera is fantastic; I no longer need to bring a dedicated digital camera when I'm traveling or attending major celebrations like graduations that need a good camera. It's performance in low-light conditions is fantastic and really something to write home about. Sure, mybrother's iPhone 11 Pro has a better camera, but he paid over $1000 for it, so that's not a fair comparison. I'd say that the Pixel 3A's camera and camera software is every bit as good as my wife's Galaxy 10, if not better.BATTERY LIFE: A full charge doesn't last the 2-3 days that my old Moto Z Play did, but the rapid charging feature makes it not matter as much. In my daily commute of 20-30 minutes to work, I can add about 30-40% to my battery, which means I never have to worry about my phone going dead, even if I forget to charge it at night. A full charge tends to last a little over a day with heavy use. For the record, nearly every day I browse the internet for hours, play Sudoku, listen to Spotify, and post and browse on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.HARDWARE: It's not a flagship phone, so it's not going to hold up to intensive use. That said, nothing I've thrown at it so far as crashed it. Like I said, I'm a heavy phone user. I don't have to close my apps before switching to another one like I did with my last phone to avoid crashes. I also have experienced hangs like I did with my last phone either. This really does everything you need it to do. I don't think that a normal to heavy phone user needs much more power than this unless they're gaming or photo editing on their phone or something. The bluetooth works a lot better than my old phones did. I have an aging 2013 Prius that does not like to play nice with bluetooth in a lot of my devices. I get in the car, and the phone automatically hooks to the bluetooth and brings up my last Spotify podcast without me fussing with it past the initial setup. I forgot how nice it was when things just worked, you know?LOOK &amp; FEEL: I really like that it's lighter than my last phone even though the screen and the screen's resolution is much larger. It doesn'thave a trendy notch, but I don't really care. The fingerprint is located in a nice place in the back that feels very intuitive. There is a feature that lets you squeeze the phone to bring up Google Assistant that I could see some people enjoying, but I never use it because my hands are too small to put enough pressure on the phone to bring it up. Some people may dock a point or two for this, if it's important to you. I don't because I can just shout ""hey google"" at the phone to the same effect, and perhaps the feature works fine if you don't have tiny baby hands like me and buy a phone that's over 6 inches. The phone itself is mostly metal and glass and doesn't feel cheap. I don't think it looks like you spent less than $400 on it at all. Most importantly, it still has an aux port. Not all of us want the hassle of charging and keeping track of bluetooth earbuds that can cost more than your phone and don't sound any better than a $10 wired headset you can get at the pharmacy. The screen is absolutely huge and the resolution makes everything tiny. I don't have bad eyes and I'm not an old maid, but I had to set the text size to ""large"" otherwise every website looks like those old Myspace profiles people made back in 2002 with size-6 font. It's very comfortable to read on; I don't feel like someone would need a dedicated tablet with a phone with a screen this big.SOFTWARE &amp; OS/UI: If you're getting an Android OS, you've probably fine with the OS. That said, Google's UI is so much better than everyone else's (I've used UIs by Asus, Samsung, and Motorola in other phones). The home screen is easier to customize, the app launcher makes sense, and the app switcher is intuitive and quick. Since it's Google, you'll have the newest Android OS's at launch and support for longer than other manufacturers. That was one thing I missed dearly about my old Nexus, and I'm glad Google is finally back in the sub-$500 market again so I can take advantage of it. I think my favorite feature about the UI is that I can turn on ""dark mode"" 24/7 so that I never have white bars or menus anywhere, just nice black ones. It's really saved my eyes. I also like that the volume and brightness on the phone has a very wide range of levels, much moreso than any other phone I've had before, which always had ""silent,"" ""soft-ish"" and ""extremely loud"" with little in between. I can turn down the volume to almost-silent and the brightness to actually quite dark without installing third party apps. Also, there's no bloatware on the phone when you purchase it. That's really nice.All in all, it's a very solid phone and I'm honestly thrilled with how nice the screen and camera is at this price-point. Everything else I've looked at with comparable specs and features is at least $100 more. I've been using mine for the past couple of weeks, and every day I like it more. Full five stars from me.",2020年6月23日 在美国审核

"I have a full Pixel 3 XL for work, and was excited for the 3a XL hit the market.  Highly Recommended","After several years of growing tired of my Samsung Galaxy work phones getting slower and more bloated with the Samsung UI, I was convinced by coworkers to go to a Pixel.I got the Pixel 3 XL and instantly loved it.Seconds, rather than minutes, to boot.A fast UI experience.Frequent and comprehensive OS updates that aren't lagging months behind the Android updates.A fantastic camera.What's not to love?Even though I refer to my Pixel 3 XL as my work phone, the truth is that I haven't had a personal phone in over a decade... who wants to carry two phones?Then again, there is something to be said about having a healthy work/life balance.With that in mind, I was curious when I heard about the 3a coming to the market... as much as I love the 3 XL, I can't say that I was super excited to spend $900 on a phone.When the 3a XL dropped below $300 (after the deal that gave you a $100 GC), it seemed like a no brainer.As someone that has both a 3XL and a 3a XL, here's what I can tell you:SCREENUnlike the 3 XL, the 3a XL has no screen ""notch"".Where there are some parts of the UI that take advantage of the notch, there are just as many applications that leave an annoying color (non-black) artifact in the notch area when watching landscape full-screen video - it's SUPER annoying.The 3a XL's screen is slightly smaller than the 3 XL, and while it's also a little lower resolution, the density (as a result of the smaller diagonal measurement) doesn't drop that much.In general usage I don't notice any difference.The 3a's screen is OLED, but it appears to be a quality tier below the 3 XL's... you can see it if they are side-by-side, but you wouldn't notice it if you were going from memory.CAMERAPixel phones are renown for their camera performance.While the raw specs tend to be behind other flagship phones' optics and CCDs, the actual picture quality tends to be at or near the top of the heap.The Pixel 3a XL is no different, as the rear camera is the same as the one on the 3 XL.The front camera (which I really don't care as much about) goes with a single, rather than a dual, camera setup.It's not the same as either front-facing camera on the Pixel 3 XL, but the software (which is largely responsible for the picture quality), is the same.Both cameras appear to be excellent.FORM FACTORThe Pixel 3a XL is slightly larger than the Pixel 3 XL.Some of it may be due to the notch-less screen causing the speaker and camera to be mounted above the screen.Some may be due to the larger capacity battery.Perhaps it's also influenced by the case material on the back being made of plastic, rather than glass.Regardless, the phone is about 10% lighter, which is enough to be noticable.An omission that I don't love is that the 3a XL does not support wireless chaging... it's not the end of the world, but it is missed.PERFORMANCEThe 3a XL does have a significantly slower CPU than the 3 XL.The layout of both processors is to have 4 high speed cores, and 4 slower cores.The general idea is that the system workloads can be managed by the OS'es thread scheduler, and be placed on to the lowest power consuming core that is still adequate for the job.Both phones are fine with multitasking.I didn't actually notice any performance difference is the UI or in application speeds, but I also am not a mobile gamer... I would expect for the difference to be most obvious there (assuming there is one).I was a little surprised when the 3 XL came out with 4GB of RAM (since I didn't know if that would be enough), but that worked out well.The 3a XL has the same 4GB of RAM and therefore has similar performance.NOTABLE DIFFERENCES NOT ALEADY MENTIONEDOddly, the Pixel 3a XL has a headphone jack.That's noteworthy because the 3 XL does NOT have a headphone jack.I know there are some ""purists"" that are anti-bluetooth, but I'd say that a phone is not an audiophile platform anyway.Even if you have awesome $1500 headphones, I can still tell you that the DAC in your sub-170 gram phone is junk (comparatively).One of the really nice features of the Pixel 3 XL is that it's waterproof... the 3a XL is not.It's not a dealbreaker for me, but I can see where this would affect some peoples' choices.In conclusion, I thought the deal I got on Amazon when I bought my 3a XL was so good that I bought the phone without even knowing if I'd get a service plan for it.Now that the 3a XL is at its ""normal"" price I still think it's an incredible deal, and I really question anyone who would buy a different phone at this device's price point.Highly Recommended.",2019年8月31日 在美国审核
Recommended in 2022,"Bought in May 2022. Color = white. Upgraded to Android 12. This is supposed to be an outdated device, but I bought it because I wanted a Pixel; because Pixels 4-6 are overpriced and have problems; and because I outgrew Samsungs and iPhones. I am middle-aged and annoyed with the world, and I like cheap stuff that is well built and just works. Age is only a number, and an older means nothing as long as it's a good deal. (I also use this as a pick up line...)Disclaimer: I optimize the crap out of my phones, and use them primarily for communication. (*Shock*) Not gaming, not content authoring/editing, or whatever the heck else the kids do. Phone, text, Email, music, finance, Twitter, Instagram, etc = Perfect. As with other Pixels, the camerapunches well above its weight. Battery life is fantastic.One month in, everything works great, and the device has actually gotten peppier the more I use it. Don't understand the mechanics of it, but it's a fact. I'll reserve final judgement 6mo in, but so far, I recommend it.Right now. (Obsolete my a$$.)",2022年6月5日 在美国审核
I love this phone!,"Had 3 Samsung's before the Pixel and decided ""3 strikes and you are out!"" This is the best phone I have had and the first one I have ever ""loved!"" It is user friendly, its intuitive, very easy to organize, the fingerprint reader actually works, the battery and charger are awesome. I haven't been thru a big update yet...my Samsung apps moved or disappeared with every big update which drove me crazy. I hope this one doesn't do that. Never had or used the assistant before, but it is great. The camera is fantastic...it focuses so much faster and pics are very sharp. Everyone I've told or showed has oohed and aahed, including Apple fans. Will use for navigation on a trip coming up. My Samsung often lost signal, so I hope this will be better. If not, i will update my review.",2019年7月11日 在美国审核
Would buy again,"Doesn't have as good of battery as my Moto g6, but about the same as most Android's I've owned. Gets charged once a day and good to go.What I do love is: the camera- awesome pictures. Ppl comment all the time how great they are especially portrait mode, looks like professional grade pictures.Love the size. I have small hands (size 6 for sterile gloving, my fellow nurses will appreciate this). I don't need a tablet trying to pass for a phone. I have a tablet for a tablet and I need my phone to fit in my hand! Thank you Google I like the durability, my son has grabbed and dropped my phone a few times. I have too. If you invest in a glass screen protector, you will be golden.I'm an Android girl so this phone has been awesome in that standard Android way. I'd buy it again. My husband has the pixel 3. He loves his too.Also, a good idea to protect your eyes. Install a blue light app ( the idea is to eliminate blue light at night time ) Motorola has the best tech for this in my opinion. But if you have to do an app, may I recommend iBlue. iBlue lite is free, and add free. Works great. I bought the Pro version for $1.99 just to throw the developers a bone, use it every night and love it. Highly recommend for people like me who have to use computers at work and who also like to be on their phones to wind down before bed. This is a life changer people.Waterproof- apparently this phone is such! Good for me as my last phone took a deep dive into cold mountain waters earlier this year...brrrr!",2020年7月17日 在美国审核
This phone is at the perfect price/performance/value point,"My old phone was a Galaxy S8+ that was dropped one time too many. It was a couple of years old, admittedly, but my new Pixel 3a XL is a better phone in every respect. One thing that might not be much to everyone but I do a lot of business texting and the speech to text is so far superior to the S8 as to be in a different universe. It almost never makes a mistake.Although the Pixel's battery spec is in the same ballpark as the S8+, functionally it seems quite a bit more potent. My average day with the S8+ had me usually coming home with 25%-30% battery. I haven't taken the Pixel below 50% in a business day yet.The camera is REALLY good for a phone. Take that comment with a grain of salt since I'm a photographer and have a collection of lenses that costs $thousands each.I've got enough money to buy any phone I want but see no reason to spend more.",2019年8月12日 在美国审核
Received within 1 day of ordering,"Given all the problems I've faced with Google's phones the past couple of years, I was extremely reluctant to buy this one.My Google phones have never lasted more than 2 years before issues arose.With my Nexus 5x, I only had it a little over a year before it started shutting on/off at random times, a common complaint from other users.When Google decided to switch phone manufacturers, I told myself, ""Maybe things will get better,"" but it turned out, only barely -- my Google Pixel only lasted a little over 2 years before the battery gave up.I was able to get a refurbished one as a replacement under my Google store warranty, but it too exhibited battery drainage issues within 2-3 months.So why did I decide to get a Google Pixel 3a in spite of all these issues?Well, first, I just couldn't find a better android than this one at this price point.The camera, speed, and lack of bloatware -- it's just hard to give up luxuries such as these when you've been spoiled by pure android for so long.Secondly, I liked Google Fi.I barely use data since I'm always in a WiFi-connected building throughout the day, so Fi's pay-as-you-go data plan has helped me save a lot of money.Family plans might be better at other places, but that wasn't a factor for me because I'm on an individual plan.Third -- and this is why I ended up buying on Amazon rather than the Google Store or Best Buy -- Amazon was able to deliver this to me within one day!I broke my phone on a Saturday night (trying to replace the battery with a DIY replacement kit I'd ordered online, if you must know), ordered this close Saturday night close to midnight, and found this on my door Sunday night at 7 pm.I am so grateful to Amazon for getting this to me before Monday morning!I use my phone to complete multiple tasks at work, so if I'd had to wait longer, it wouldn't have been the end of the world but it would've been pretty disruptive to my workflow.",2019年10月21日 在美国审核
Note 9 to 3a,I had a note 9 and it broke so I got this and honestly I don't feel like I'm missing much. Of course it lacks the note taking features and wireless charging. I really miss Samsung pay but honestly all in all its a great phone especially for price. Nice screen good sound. Great tactile feedback. The call screening feature is great. Pictures look great.

Best phone for the money right now,"Love this phone. Had an original Pixel and gave it up when I switched networks to avoid paying in full to take with me to AT&amp;T. Really glad I went back to Pixel from Moto. Phone is light weight, holds a charge more than a full day for me with medium usage and you can't beat the camera on Pixel. People complain about the old snapdragon but I can't tell a difference. Comparing side by side to an s10 or Pixel 3 this phone opens apps alittle slower but once in the apps its just as fast. The screen is crisp, the phone is more than quick enough for the avg person and it's only $399",2019年7月3日 在美国审核

A very good cell phone with a bit of a charging issue,"I have had my Pixel 3a for a couple of weeks now it it works well and is fast. I actually would like it to be a little thicker and not as big, since I am not a large phone fan and have trouble with using any phone that is over 5"" with one hand. The battery life is actually excellent for how thin the phone is. It lasts for at least 6 hours under heavy usage while texting and playing games like Pokemon Go or Wizards Unite and it will last all day as long as I play games for less than 4 hours. The only drawback I have found is that it refuses to charge very fast except when hooked to a few specific USB chargers that support the Power Delivery standard.",2019年7月30日 在美国审核
4 month review,"After having this phone for 4 months I thought I should at least post my impressions on using this phone on a daily basis. I can say I’ve been really happy with it.Coming into this phone knowing about the lack of water resistance and questionable physical durability I knew that I would have to treat it very gingerly if it was going to hold up at all, which has not been an issue after 4 months of use. I have been very proactive in not doing anything to challenge it’s physical limitations. Although I’m curious how well this phone could survive a significant drop unto a hard surface, such as concrete, I’ve been very protective of this device and very careful in how I’ve handled it and that’s been no problem for me.What’s really blown me away about the Pixel 3a is something very few have mentioned which is how well wifi-calling works with it. My provider, Mint Mobile, which is a T-Mobile reseller supports wifi-calling but it has to be configured on the phone you are using in addition to enabling it on the provider. No problem with Mint Mobile and an unlocked Pixel 3a. So, the cellular signal in my house is not the greatest. It’s ok but nothing to write home about so call quality is not always the greatest. That’s where wifi calling comes in and the beauty of it is that it’s totally transparent, coming on at home and at other places where the cellular signal is poor or non-existent. Since wifi is available where I need it, most everywhere these days, call quality is not an issue, even in an environment with a poor quality cellular signal. What strikes me the most is the phone’s ability to transition to and from wifi calling without call interruption or loss. So, when I leave my house while in a call, I don’t lose the call as the phone transitions from wifi calling to cellular. For me, this has been the biggest plus of the phone.Of course the quality of the camera is the one outstanding feature that is most often talked about and I have to admit it can take incredible pictures.I also like the display and battery life is more than sufficient for my purposes. I’m not a game enthusiast so game performance is of no importance. The phone is very responsive and I really haven’t experienced any performance issues. YouTube, YouTube TV and Pluto work wonderfully on this device. I think the sound, both on speakers and bluetooth is very good.",2019年12月20日 在美国审核

Exactly what the US market needs,"Switched from OG Pixel XLI've had the phone for about a week and absolutely love it.

Google spent money where it actually matters with this phone and I believe they made perfect choices.+ OLED screen, looks better than my Pixel XL+ Camera, no expense spared,+ Build quality is excellent, plastic does not feel cheap and can take a beating when you drop it.

They really paid attention to this one and it shows.+ Processor speed is zippy for all that you need to do. Yes, they didn't put the latest and greatest processors inside but they opted for a slightly older (but still great) processor that consumes less battery.In my opinion, I would rather have a longer battery life with a great processor than terrible battery life with an advanced just released-processor.

Certainly the best Android phone I've had to date,"Have been using Android since 8yrs ago, and passed throught the Samsung Range, from the S4, S5 and S6; tried then other brands like LG and Motorola after having disappointing battery life with Samsung. Seriously considered switching to the dark side (iPhone, already happened with tablets, happy iPad owner), and this was my last shot on Android. This is the first time I've got an Android with real all-day battery life (even with multiple email accounts and apps sync), stellar software support (latest Android version and security updates), Ana stellar camera, all at the same time. Love the compact size of the regular 3a, 64GB is plenty space (mostly use Google photos and other cloud services for storage, may be ""low"" if having multiple games); and it looks good. Don't think that because it's plastic is 'subpar', most people get their glass or metal phones a cover so it's something I don't mind. And the real deal sealer is the affordable price.

Loving this phone,"I was all set to pony up $700 for the new Oneplus 7 Pro when Google formally announced the Pixel 3a and it showed up on Amazon along with a promotion that included $100 gift card. That was too good to pass up. There are tons of reviews and videos on both phones, so I won't add much here, except to comment on the two things that I had qualms about before ordering: 1) The phone feels very solid despite the plastic body. The build quality far surpasses my old plastic Nexus 5x. 2) The phone is plenty fast despite having a processor that is on paper inferior to the ones in the Oneplus 7 Pro and other expensive phones. If you don't have another phone to compare to it right next it, you won't notice any limitations in processing.So I'm really pleased with this purchase, and I'd say it would still be worth it even without the $100 gift card thrown in.",2019年5月31日 在美国审核
"Great phone.  Amazing camera.  No microSD slot.  Boo.  Still, great value.","A really good mid price phone.The phone does what is should, the camera is amazing.Especially the night mode.The photos in this mode are almost better than live viewing.Great image processing.Almost unbelievable.Size is good...I don't want to carry a TV around with me.This fits my pocket.I protect it with an Otterbox Symmetry and a tempered glass screen protector.The Symmetry is not size imposing and gives the phone something to hang on to.Charge time is very fast.Battery life is OK...but I get nervous when it drops below 60% anyway, so maybe it's just me.The screen, whenbright, seems to suck a lot of juice, so it's always a balance tobe able to view, and also go easy on the battery.The camera is, as advertised, way out of the budget class.I've compared low light pictures to phone/camera costing double and the 3a is clearly FAR superior.The image processing is superior.The most lacking feature is that there is no optional external microSD slot.Really?That should be a requirement.My guess is that since it's a Google phone, and since Google is cloud based, and since Google makes money by charging for cloud storage, well, you can see where that's going.But this feature is something they REALLY should reconsider.Not everyone wants everything in the cloud.It was almost a deal breaker for me.Heck, I use an offline GPS that has 6G of maps!that's almost 10% of the available space.Shame.Recommend buying this phone if you're interested in a mid-price phone with an excellent camera.Doesn't replace a good SLR, but a whole lot handier to carry!",2019年9月6日 在美国审核

"Had a Pixel 2, glad I upgraded","I was sceptical for a while about getting this phone. Mainly because the hardware is less powerful than it's predecessor. I owned the pixel 2 and absolutely loved it. That phone took a beating and it held up for over two years. Now it will be given to my sister. So I had high expectations. But this phone is much better. The screen resolution although has similar specs to the 2, looks much crisper and full of color that when compared to the 2, is obvious.The headphone Jack was also a huge plus factor. The extra piece necessary to plug in headphones on the last two pixels falls out and got annoying. The camera is impressive, I'm still shocked on some of the pictures being taken, especially when the Pixel 2 had such a great camera.And finally the hardware. The phone has absolutely no noticeable lag and performs just as great as the two. I use my phone with multiple apps open doing a lot of multitasking and had no issue. The one thing I don't do is play serious games on my phone so I couldn't attest there, I usually wait till I get home to play Xbox which would be much more enjoyable.All in all, great phone. The only bummer about the entire phone, is the lack of waterproofing. I've seen videos where they test what the pixel 3a can take in terms of water and it holds up well.

Really this isn't a big deal for me, I keep up with the storage on my devices, but for some that like carry large media libraries it may be a deal breaker. It also doesn't look as premium as devices that have edge-to-edge screens like the latest iphones and other flagship devices, but really it's a 1/3 of theprice of these devices.

Great phone!,"This is an amazing phone and I'm very impressed. The software is very good. Their claim of 7 hours of battery life after 15 minutes of charging is a little far fetched but it is still very good and I really don't find myself needing to charge more than once per day. The fingerprint scanner can sometimes be annoying when it doesn't recognize your finger but it's not often that it happens. All in all I'm very happy with it and am glad I got it. It could however have a little bit bigger battery because if you are a heavy streamer or play games alot I could see it needing charged at least twice per day. But if you are like me and just want a phone that works and is capable of playing a game like solitaire, Sudoku or watching a couple hours of video and still have the battery last all day than this phone is for you!",2019年7月6日 在美国审核
Best Pixel phone bar none,"I bought one of these last year for my wife who'd been on a Nexus 5X for 3+ years. She loves the 3a, especially for it's speed and stellar camera. I admit, I'm still on the Nexus 5X and it obliterates my camera and image output. I just bought another one of these for my son after the price dropped. He got Mom's old Nexus 5X. The 3a is a heck of a bargain at $279 even though it's not a 2020 model. Compared the 5X it's replacing, it might as well be. That being said, don't hold your breath (like I was) that the Pixel 4a will be out by October. I was waiting and waiting for it to come out May....then June....then MAYBE July. Then hearing MAYBE October. Forget it. Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. And with Android 11 coming out in a month or so, this phone will be even better and faster.",2020年7月4日 在美国审核
Great phone,"+ Great for normal everyday use.+ Adaptive battery is incredible with fast charging support. At normal use, able to last me from 6am to 1130pm with 15% left (Whatsapp, Calls, Spotify &amp; Social apps. Also paired my Mi Band 3 throughout the day).+ Camera is amazing but there's noticeable delay in processing photos. Unlimited cloud storage at high quality.+ Loud stereo speakers.+ Headphone jack.+ Android One- Only wished 3a has more storage options. 64GB is too limited.

No need to spend a $1000 bucks. This is a game changer.,"Careful when buying these, mine was not Verizon compatible and had to return it even though the seller said it was. ""Completely unlocked"" does not mean it will work on US carriers. As far as the phone goes it's hands down the best $400 phoneon the market in 2019. The camera is amazing, battery life great and form factor perfect. As long as you get it here or from the manufacturer and not your carrier it comes with guaranteed three years of support.

"Good phone, GREAT customer service.","I have had the 3a for years now, and ended up buying one for my husband for Valentine's Day! The camera is out of this world. I can't go a day without taking a pic, and with this phone I can always get great photos of anything; from a cool rock to a nice business headshot all without having to lug a full camera around?? Magical.The first device we received was unfortunately locked which was a little frustrating since it was a gift, but things happen.I was dreading trying to get a replacement since returns are always a pain in the arse, but they immediately sent me a return label. A few days later we got our replacement phone and it was perfect. They both looked like new and functioned perfectly besides the locked issue, but that was quickly and efficiently addressed!

Pixel 3A from Moto G. Smart Move,"Received the Pixel 3A from Amazon just under a week ago for the $279 promotion.Awesome.Especially now that Google has discontinued the Pixel 3A.I replaced my Moto G6 Plus mainly because the charge was not holding and the sound was inconsistent.The phone flexed and it affected the speaker.The Moto G6 was an intl' model; which I regret getting.The Pixel 3A booted up relatively quick with a USB-C connection cord to my existing phone.It transferred my apps and ~ 30 gbs of data in about 5 minutes.The phone's sound is good (contrary to some reviews-maybe those are older phones/software).The camera is great as advertised including the night sight.Admittedly, many of the features that are appealing deal with the Android 10 software (which my Moto G likely would have never received).The 3A doesn't have the flip for the camera but it has the double click on the power button that turns the camera on (Moto G fans know).Keeping the phone jack is a big plus.I have wireless buds but it is a hassle to worry about charging them.The Amoled screen is really clear.The screen size is a bit of adjustment from the larger 6.2"" G but it is noticeably easier to navigate with one hand.Not having an expandable SD slot isn't a deal breaker since Google offers the unlimited storage for photos and videos (less than actual size) but still high res so likely never will notice since we're not talking professional photos.The phone build is plastic but you really wouldn't know it by holding.Plus as soon as you put a cover on, non issue.Finger print reader on the back is quick and accurate.I've had numerous Moto G phones so never ventured out of the budget / mid tier.My wife uses an iPhone 8 and I can tell this Pixel is comparable if not better.Don't know if I will miss the Moto G line; especially with the deal I got.Anyone that doesn't need a flagship phone will not be dissatisfied by this Pixel.",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Stock Android and Fully compatible with Tesla Model 3,"Works flawlessly with my Tesla Model 3. My previous Pixel XL had bluetooth incompatibilities, not the 3A it's the prefect Android phone for a Model 3.Like other Pixel phones, this is stock Android and gets all the updates. Migrating apps and settings from your old phone is easy, just login, setup and you transfer using a direct cable connection or restore from an online.Battery life is very good, after a one hour drive using Waze it only used 15% of battery and that included a 10 minute call as well. Charging is super fast. The charge cable that came with the phone is quite short. WIsh it came with the same travel charger my original Pixel came with which had a much longer charge cable.64GB of storage is plenty.

Good performance / price point sweet spot,"Not much to say. Works great out of the box. Been using it for months now and it's way faster than other android phones I've used at this price range. These days, phones at this price point are nearly non-existent, so I'm glad Google is producing a device for this section of the market.A perk of it being a google device is that it receives android system updates on a regular basis, which is crucial for security purposes, and welcome for performance / QoL reasons. The phone launched with Android 9, and they pushed an Android 10 system update as soon as it was out of beta. I am not sure if I should expect to be receiving whatever the next major android release is on this phone, but even this level of support is above and beyond what I've received from, say, Samsung. If I could go back and make the purchasing decision again, I would probably have gone with the 3a XL instead of the 3a.",2019年10月19日 在美国审核
Google returns to its senses and offers a high value product,"What is differentiates the phone these days? If your answer is the bezel or the 'notch', this phone may not appeal to you. But for someone like me, who likes a simple phone with a great screen and an excellent camera at a reasonable price, Pixel 3A came out at the very top of the list.The screen is a stunning OLED screen with the highest resolution that my eye can discern. It is very almost impossible to see individual pixels and the images look crisp, with a great contrast ratio.As a result, the pictures look amazing and reading on the screen is a joy. The best part of the phone is a great camera that takes great pictures. To me, this is the big differentiating factor among phones these days. All phones are more or less the same on other commonly used features. The pictures are really excellent, with almost an DSLR-level quality to them. A true Android OS with no wizardry programmed on top of the OS means that the system is very simple, yet fully functional. You may have to download some apps that you are used to, but this simplicity makes the phone very appealing to me. There is only one drawback on the phone: Lack of an external SD memory storage.Perhaps one doesn't need a lot of storage if we store all our data on the cloud, but lack of an external memory option is nevertheless disappointing.In summary, if you value your hard earned money enough not to throw it on gimmicks like the 'Notch free screen','edge screens' or some random sensor (that you probably would never use), Pixel 3A should rank very high on your list.Over the past 4-5 years, phones have rapidly evolved, perfected and commoditized. Phone manufacturers rely on customers paying premiums for gimmickry to keep their margins elevated. There is no reason to pay $1000 for a phone which can do very little that is different from a $300-$400 phone.",2019年6月27日 在美国审核
Excellent phone - a great upgrade from my Moto Z2 Force,"I had purchased a Moto to get an almost pure android experience and enjoyed it quite a bit. The Z2 Force was fast for its time and the screen is still beautiful. It didn't have a great screen though ... the unbreakable plastic mess was a mistake. The Pixel 3A is a night and day improvement over the Z2 Force, which hadn't been updated by AT&amp;T since Oreo.I enjoy getting the regular security updates from Google and having a true pure Android experience. Build quality is pretty decent but the software (though paired with decently competent hardware) is what makes this phone shine. This phone has converted me to the Pixel family - I'm inclined to stay if prices in this mid-range Pixel phone category (e.g. 4A, 5A, etc.) continue to be competitive.Thanks Google!",2020年1月28日 在美国审核

"Excellent phone, unbeatable value","I have had my phone for about a month (Prime day deal). I am a light user. The most power consuming daily use is the 45 minutes Prime video while at the gym. By the way I came from a Galaxy S5 which is old but I'd still be using if not for the dying battery. So take the opinion of a non-gadget person for what it is worth.The battery life has been amazing. I recharge about every four days when the battery level drops to about 20-30%. Now I can leave the house in the morning with 30% battery level and not having to worry about the phone dying. The camera is great. I like taking pictures of flowers and the blurring effect in the portrait mode is exactly what I need. Not having an SD card slot is a pity. I get around that by transferring my pictures to a thumb drive using the include USB adapter. 64G memory seems to be quite enough for a me so far.

Amazing camera. Good enough phone.,"Have been using this phone for a little over 3 weeks now and so far have not found it lacking. I deliberately left behind my camera (a Panasonic ZS-100) on my recent trip to Japan to see if it could take the place of a regular camera, and it did not disappoint. Night sight was especially a revelation-- I had results that rivaled a DSLR or mirrorless camera with a 1.8 prime lens wide open. Plus Google Maps and Translate were a godsend in navigating the subway system. I never felt lost as long as I had my Pixel.

Decent performance from a budget phone,"The OLED screen is really nice, and I was not bothered by the excessive length of the panel. I am used to 16:9 phones so this was new to me. The phone feels as premium as any other phone when you put a case on it. The battery lasts a good amount of time. I get by two days on a charge so I'm not complaining. The camera is good, although it has overly extreme color correction, so a warmly lit room (3000k light bulbs) will appear almost pure white (in color) in the photos.The fingerprint reader was fine, but it will 100% reject a slightly dusty or slightly moist finger, so I have to wipe both my fingerprint reader and my finger on my shirt to get it to read. If you fail the finger print reader too many times, it makes you wait before you try again. THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE THIS SECURITY THEATER. I hate that it does that.",2020年5月22日 在美国审核
Don't waste money on flagships,"I bought a Pixel 3a reluctantly after owning a Samsung s9+, LG V20, LG G4, LG G3. This was thew first time I tried a truly budget phone. Let it be said, I would absolutely recommend saving quite a few hundred dollars on getting this over any flagship on the market. It's screen is great, the battery life is by and large the best I've ever seen on a phone, when the battery says you have 1 Day 4 Hours left, you got no worries about the battery, and with an 18W charger, it charges up to full in about an hour. The performance isn't an issue at all, I've never noticed anything close to a slow down, and unless you are playing Crysis 3 on your phone, you won't have any problems. Camera is still fantastic, better than some flagships (released at the time).

However it was a nominal issue. My other giant issue was the fact that the screen is simply too tall. It does not fit the standard resolution of most media.

I'm not going to go on about benchmarks and stuff like that, but if you want a phone that has flagship quality at a mid-range price, the Pixel 3a is your phone.",2020年1月7日 在美国审核

Amazing value!,"No complaints with this phone, it is the perfect android experience. Coming from an iPhone XR, I bought this because a) I am not a fan of iOS compared to android, and b) The phone itself was way too big and heavy. This phone is super lightweight, very thin so one-handed use is perfect, very sturdy. I don't think a case is necessary with this phone. The phone itself is very speedy and responsive, the camera quality is the best I have seen, and it is very easy to navigate. Will purchase Pixel phones from now on!",2019年9月11日 在美国审核
Fantastic,"I really like this phone. It is great. It is the right size for me, very responsive, fingerprint reader works perfectly, and more. I would buy this again in a second. Of course, everyone raves about the camera and rightly so. I considered waiting for the 4a but I was having too many problems with my old phone. Plus, I saw unsubstantiated images of the proposed 4a with the Pixel 4 ""boxing"" camera on the back. I wasn't crazy about that look.

Great phone overall. Even better on promotions.,"A great phone for the price. And a great phone overall!Pixel 3a xl has a unique combination of things that are just good enough and exceptional. So, here is my rundown of those features:1) Camera - exceptional quality, ease of use and consistency. Just point and shoot and you will get a great photo, no matter the lighting condition and scene.2) Battery life - amazing. If you switch off always on screen and Google assistant - you can get up to 2 days with moderate use, or a full day of hard use with some 20-30% buffer.3) Screen - good enough. It has ok resolution and brightness. No major problems with it. It is not as great as Samsung flagship screens, thought.4) Speakers - good enough. Dual speakers, one bottom firing and another - front firing. They get decently loud and stay clear. You can listen to some music or videos.5) Vibration motor is a game changer. Some times I come back on to my LG V20, and the vibration motor there feels sloppy. So having that haptic response girl miles for your user experience.6) Headphone Jack is here and it is convenient.The screen is covered with glass, it scratches, so use protection. The body is made of plastic, which is high quality and doesn't pick scratches even without a case. So protect the screen and enjoy this great Android phone.",2020年3月3日 在美国审核

I am writing from the phone after 3 day of testing it and I'm very happy. Battery is excellent, I am comparing it to my Huawei mate 20 pro. The con is that charger that came with the phone is not original so I stopped using and lucky I had a fast charger. So it doesn't matter. I recommend that seller",2022年5月26日 在美国审核
Nothing but problems,"Not here to bash seller, but ive had nothing but bad experiences from this seller. I ordered and got the phone, did set up and updates/operating system, and the phone doesn't work. Apps won't open at all. Factory reset it 5x. Nothing helped. I have 3 of these phones and am very familiar with it, and this one was just plain messed up.<br>Besides that, I was told they wouldn't return the phone for another one which is what I wanted. The seller hung up on me, nothing got done. So I settled to get my money back after I return it. I wanted to get it replaced but they won't allow it.So as I'm sure this might be a great phone for people who get a good one, but mine is crap and customer service sucks. So I'll be trying to get one more from this seller.To the Seller: it's unfortunate that you won't just exchange my phone and that you hang up on customers.

The thing is fast for everyday use, just don't expect to be doing heavy multi-tasking or browsing 10 websites at once. The camera is mindbogglingly good and not even just for a mid-range phone. The camera on this thing beats every flagship camera out of the water (all but the Pixel 3 itself maybe).The squeeze to activate Google Assistant is something I thought I wouldn't use...until I used it.

I guess I don't need a flagship after all.,"I love this phone. I used the original Pixel and absolutely loved it. But the battery was going out and needed to be replaced. I am a heavy user, but but a demanding user. I surf (the web- this phone isn't water resistant), I take photos, and I stream music and video. I'm not doing heavy duty media editing or gaming.I will tell you, for my use and probably yours, this is all the phone I need. I won't be spending flagship money again. The photos are outstanding. The battery lasts all day. It has gracefully handled everything I've thrown at it.Coming from the aluminum body and hearing about the plasticky build, I was apprehensive. No. It's not plasticky. It's plastic, but it feels solid in hand. The screen has seemed more susceptible to scratches than the gorilla glass of the OG Pixel.Whatever I might be missing with this midrange model, there's nothing I notice, much to my surprise.",2019年10月21日 在美国审核

The camera works great, has great low light performance and for the amount I will use it I don't find myself wishing for the Pixel 3 XL's improved cameras. The fingerprint reader works fast, although I am a fan of the front side fingerprint reader like my S7 had.

I love the fact that it has so many factory installed ringtones and wallpapers which are great to look at and hear. I love video games so the retro game tones are right up my alley!

Swipe texting is such a pleasant feature that already comes with the device. I don't know a whole lot about cell phones, but given the price of these bad boys, I would choose this over the Galaxy phones. Finger print recognition never works when I'm working out, but I think that's due to my sweat messing with the sensors.The only thing I would like is the wireless charging and waterproof phone.

Unless something happens to the phone in the future I think you are making a really good choice with the google pixel 3a. I hope google continues to make high quality phones in this price range.

Smartest smartphone I have used,"I have been using the pixel 3a for almost a month now. It's been a positive experience, swapping iPhone to join the pixel wave. The highlight of the phone is the photos it can take and the overall user experience. This has to be the smartest smartphone I have used.<br>It does everything so well and just blends in the background of your life. Squeeze for assistant, night sight, intelligent ram allocation, fingerprint scroll, now playing etc. make this phone appear smarter than most smartphones from even the top tier.<br>I also like the fact that phone is so light in your hands and you can access the complete screen space using one finger.But, I do feel the phone is slightly less durable. The dragon trail glass used instead of gorilla looks and feel similar but seems a bit weaker. I dropped the phone on some sand and the glass on the right corner of the chin cracked. Usually, gorilla glass would deal with that kind of a fall without a crack.The battery life is great, recharges rapidly and lasts for a day's use - easy. The phone is not the fastest, but fast enough for almost everything you throw at it.In a nutshell, I think this is the best value your $399 can get in the smartphone universe.</br></br>",2019年8月31日 在美国审核

Great Phone Until It Doesn't Work - Horrible Google Customer Service,"I don't usually write reviews but I promised Google I would write one so here it is: This phone worked great for the first 3 months I had it. It took beautiful pictures and was very convenient (although I did find Google's incessant ""suggestion"" to use theGoogle Assistant and constant attempts to get into my personal info very annoying). It's a good size and light weight. Coming from an iPhone 6s, it was a seamless transition and the price was reasonable. After 3 months, the speaker started to cackle. A couple of weeks later, it completely died. With it went my ringer, which essentially meant there went my alarms. I couldn't put the phone on speaker for calls anymore and so there went my Skype calls for the family to join in on my side. I contacted Google through the phone's chat feature. They told me to reboot in Safe Mode because another application was causing the speakers not to work. Red flag: if your phone's hardware is disabled because another application is running in the background, that's an issue. I tried and it didn't work. Google Support then told me to wipe the phone clean. This was the very reason I no longer wanted an iPhone; I lost a lot of data when I had to wipe the phone clean. Only then, it was after 3 years whereas here, it was after 3 months. At this point, the phone was getting slow and the screen wouldn't rotate. Their suggestion was to take it to a store (UBreakIFix) where it can be physically looked at. Took time off of work, went there and was told I had to wipe the phone clean. Red flag #2: A phone that has to be wiped clean and hard reset after only 3 months. I begrudgingly agreed. Nope, didn't fix the problem. The speaker didn't work (although the screen rotate did). The store told me I would have to leave my phone for 2 business days so they can fix it. I don't have extra phones laying around the house and I need my phone to be on call so this wasn't an option for me. I called Google Support again. Here's the kicker: their solution was to send the phone into Google and they would look at it to fix it. It would be 5-10 BUSINESS days before I found out what was wrong with my phone. I asked them to send me a phone and I would immediately send this back. I even offered my credit card number so they could charge me for the new phone if I didn't send the old one back. Nope. Their only solution, for a brand new phone that has hardware issues after 3 months, was that I would be without it for at least two weeks. When I told them I couldn't be without a phone for that long, they suggested that I contact Amazon since my phone was under warranty. For a multi-billion dollar company to not offer a replacement phone ASAP or to have a store where I can actually take my phone and get a new one is ridiculous.After an hour on the phone with Amazon, they agreed to authorize a return since Google gave me an email saying the item had to be returned via Amazon for the warranty. Then I had to spend another hour on the phone to convince them to waive the restocking fee, which the customer service manager kindly agreed to do. I now have a phone I've borrowed from someone else to cover the 3 days between returning the phone and getting a new one. So if you want a phone that works great for 3 months and then is a month of headaches and frustration, get this phone. My suggestion: save yourself the trouble and buy something else.

Eats up tons of data due to WiFi issues,"The pixel doesn't have the ability to connect to familiar wifis like every other smart phone. So, if you connect it to your home, school, or work wifi and tell it to remember and always connect to that, it still won't. You have to manually reconnect each time. Many pixel users, including myself, are stuck with ""connected, no internet"" signal when the phone attempts to automatically connect. So instead of using WiFi, you're usually using your data.For example: You have it automatically connect to your work wifi when its in range. You leave work, go home, come back to work, and notice it says ""connected, no internet"" on your work wifi. You then have to reconnect to the wifi to get it to connect. Now, if you didn't notice, you would have been using your data!I'm not surprised.

So far so good - but I wonder for how long,"My old Pixel1 died - or rather the battery did, and well you cannot replace it without spending ""half a phone"" on it.I don't think any phone is worth $1000+ so I was happy that Google offered the 3a which has plenty of capacity for what I use my phone for for a reasonable price.I went from having 15-30 minutes of phone time on a full charge to days.The process of copying data over failed because the old phone could not keep a charge long enough for the process to complete. With the help of Google support, I did a phone restore from the cloud instead, but this does not include _all_ data/apps. So the process of migrating from old to new phone, even within Google's own systems, was far from optimal and successful. Google support was very helpful of at least getting an operational phone with 85-90% of all features installed.You just need patience - every app have to be downloaded, you have to re-authorize/authenticate everything - and if you like me use apps for OTP, you'll have to create all new keys.Feature wise I like the XL size better then the original size. The ""press for google assistant"" sucks and will soon be disabled. I love the finger-print authentication, I used that a lot on Pixel1 too and it's still easy to use. Camera works, even thought he google app for taking photos is getting worse.The driving-mode feature sorta worked on the old Pixel, but it's like it has all new life on Pixel3a. The only problem is that it's over aggressive. Sitting on a plane I had to constantly turn it off as we taxied to take off (airplane mode does not disable GPS). But in my car it's GREAT - I start playing podcasts, set my destination and as I drive out the garage the drive-app activates and now incoming calls are ""restricted"" and full hands-free works great. The old pixel, this was all a manual process - and it would get confused at times and refuse to stop podcasts when calls came in.Given my experience with the pixel1 I'm unsure of the longevity of this phone. It has the same design fault not giving you access to the battery without a lot of special tools or spending quite a lot of money to have someone else do it.

3 cons I wish I had realized when I did my research to buy this phone,"Battery: The battery is the worst. I have had Samsung Androids and iPhones in the past with much Long batteries life. I will charge to 100 and need to charge again aroun 4pm with standard usage. The same usage that wouldn't drain my phones of past. Then when my battery runs low ...I find the 2nd issue with this phone.The charging cord: goggle Pixel decided to come out with a completely different cord that is incompatible with Samsung Androids and iPhones alike. Your phone comes with a power block for the wall and a ""male to male"" version of their charge plug. In order to plug into standard USB to charge you need the little piece they provided then you need to purchase a male to male USB chord to use it. That means you need 3 pieces to charge if you don't have your own charger.Storage: NO MINI SD slot. You have to let Google have everything in their cloud. I wasn't able to transfer my old phone photos and information with my micro SD. I have to keep my old phone around to access my photos and Info stored on my Sd.Camera: the camera is not mind blowing but it's good. At first I thought loved the portrait mode..it blurs the surrounding background....until I realized you can see a line that separates The clear backgrounds From the blurred background. It looks like a bad photo shop job.Fingerprint: This Option is very convenient.",2019年12月14日 在美国审核

Think twice before buying ANYTHING from Google,"No problems so far with the phone; seems nice, but nothing special. My problem is with Google Fi support. I bought this phone to replace the Moto G6 I send in under warranty repair. After a couple of weeks waiting for a replacement, I decided to buy a new phone (but not through Google Fi) and use the Moto G6 as a spare. Well, it has now been 3 months and a dozen or more interactions with Google's dysfunctional call center and I still haven't gotten a replacement phone, even though I am still paying them every month for it. Decided to switch to Cricket (ATT) and got a new G7 for free as part of the deal with no commitment. Inthe end, I wasn't saving any money with Google Fi and the call quality was very poor compared to ATT. Should my Pixel have problems, at least I have some leverage with Amazon. Can't imagine they much like Google either. Don't be evil!",2019年10月1日 在美国审核

Impressive camera!,"To begin with my review is somehow biased because i love Google products! But still, i tried to put that fact aside as i was testing my pixel.When it comes to cellphones I believe we weight certain features differently, in my case is pretty simple: all I really care about is the camera, computing power and battery life.I'm a hobbyist photographer and i own a full frame camera but carrying it everywhere is a hassle, so i find it really convenient to have a decent camera always with me. Night sight is definitely impressive! The photos are always crisp and this camera is really versatile, specially when taking low light pictures. The camera is simple to use, there's no way to change settings such as shutter speed or iso but that's not a big problem for me.The battery life is great! I normally charge my phone every 2 days but i must say that the processing power is not great, I've had a few cases where the phone ""freezes"" for a few seconds but not quite often so it's not a deal breaker for me.Overall i would give this phone a 4.5 rating but I'm definitely satisfied with the camera so I'll go for the 5 stars!",2019年7月30日 在美国审核

I looked up the issue and contacted Google support on chat through the phone and after triaging it 5 times, found out that it was a hw issue and had to do a factory reset. They offered me a replacement as I was within warranty, but with a refurbished device only and the reason is that in my geography that’s the only option available. I live in Seattle, US and there are brand new devices available on Google store. I searched on Google.com about this issue more but couldn’t find a lot on why Googles only offering refurbished to someone who paid the full price and the hw failed within 6 months. So I went to bing.com as I was curious and lo and behold, there were several results about their rampant hw issues, poor customer service where you can’t call them, but only chat online and how they do not offer a new device as replacement and further more, how even their refurbished devices have issues. They are also in the process of settling a class action lawsuit for the same issue for their Gen 1 devices. So realized that they are suppressing negative results on their search and so I escalated this to their higher ups and now they are refusing to respond! Last person that responded says this is the best they can do and pointed me to the class action website if I have further complaints! I regret buying this phone and the only reason I bought it is cos they stopped making timely updates to Samsung devices. Now I’m switching out of Android completely and will be buying an iPhone which is way more reliable and responsive in customer service. Google is cheating the customers for a quick buck and I have already lodged a complaint with the California District Attorney’s office.",2020年5月3日 在美国审核

Should've been great. Plagued with issues,"To preface, I came from an Essential PH-1 that I really loved, but the call quality was just atrocious. I was looking for a budget phone (eh, I can't believe $400 is considered cheap for a phone these days, but I digress) that had stock android, which only leaves the Pixel 3A, as far as I know.Problems:Crashing / freezing - I had this happen numerous times, which ultimately led to me returning the 3A. At first it started refusing to come out of lock screen and would just completely lock. Only way out was to try and get recovery mode started. Then it started freezing while in use. Same thing again - recovery mode was the only thing that would work.Bluetooth - BT volume is laughably bad. On the PH-1, my car stereo would be at 25-30 volume. With the 3A, I was at 40-45. Yes, it still works technically. But that is almost maxed out and I'm only at a normal listening level. After googling the issue, it seems to be a fairly common complaint.Annoyances:Stock Android - After using the PH-1 for a few years, I grew to love having complete control over android and was expecting the same from the 3A. It's better than other bloatware loaded phones out there, but there are so many Google crapware apps that can't be uninstalled. Knowing Google's reputation for spying on people and data mining, I can only assume this is why you can't uninstall their apps. If you value your privacy at all, this may not be the phone for you.Good:Battery life - It's true, the battery life is stellar. I would typically get one day out of my PH-1. On the 3A, one day I forgot to plug it in the night before and managed to get through an entire second day.So roughly double SOT of my PH-1.Screen - OLED screen on a $400 phone seems like a great deal.Meh:Build quality - It definitely feels cheap. I get it's ""only a $400 phone"" but I'd prefer if a $400 device didn't feel like a tupperware lid.Ultimately, I had to return it. If it's already crashing and freezing in the first few weeks, lord knows it's only going to get worse later on.",2019年9月19日 在美国审核

Not happy,"Was excited for all the hype on the google pixel 3a and FINALLYgetting a phone that was built to last. IT LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR!!! The mother board is dead. I have no way to get the files that I didn't back up to the cloud and the phone doesn't offer the option to have a SD card. I feel physically ill over this. I had just taken photos for my small business last evening and have no way to get them. A years worth of photos of my kids, gone. I have always had a protective case and a screen protector and the phone looks like it did the day I got. I am not abusive to my phone and take care of it. I have lost all confidence in being able to buy a smart phone that does what I need, will last more than a year and won't cost me a quarter of our monthly income. I was still learning what all my phone could do. it took decent photos but never saw any great night time photos that it said it could take. Battery life was disappointing after a few months of use and had to keep chargers through out my house and business. Memory seemed to fill up quickly and I am not a huge gamer, I had no more than one or two games at any given time. Just sad.",2020年12月8日 在美国审核

The best value phone available for its features,"I recently got this phone for my mom for her birthday. I had a Google Pixel 3 (non-XL) and previously had a Google Pixel 1. Google makes great phones that offer good value and a killer camera and the purest android experience. Previously, my mom has been having problems with her older (LG G5 and previous phones as well) always getting slow and buggy over time. This happens, I find, far slower with a pure android experience and the constant, fast updates that Google offers for their phones directly.With the newly released Pixel 3a, being a budget, yet not significantly slower version of the Pixel 3, I knew this was a good deal and an excellent phone choice for my mom. Had this been available when I first was getting my phone, I would have gotten it as well instead of the Pixel 3. Many agree, that the Pixel 3a is a good enough phone that offers value without compromising too much. While you can sometimes notice it being slightly slower, the average use and consumer will not.While it might not have the best specs at this price, I am willing to take a CPU downgrade in order to have the best user and camera experience on a phone.",2019年6月2日 在美国审核

"My new phone after iPhone, glad I made the change","Changing phones has its challenges: getting used to the way it operates is one of them. The first thing I marveled at with this phone is the battery life. Astounding! Really. I may never go back to iPhone. I took the leap after the news that Apple was purposefully slowing down older phones. I am happy with all the aspects of this camera EXCEPT... Google automatically puts all photos you take with it into Google Photos. Then, the notice that you don't have enough space and your email will stop coming unless you pay a monthly fee for extra storage. I looked up how to disconnect my phone from Google and basically, you can't. So that's the downside. (Maybe that's any Android?)Here's another piece I love about this phone. When I use the dictation feature, the program has picked up the words I use that are not English but used with my community and friends (transliterated) and that makes it much easier. When I type, the same thing. Why couldn't my iPhone ever get that when I type ""Shabbat"" that it nearly always came with ""Shalom""? My pixel gets it.Very happy with the purchase.PS If I had it to do over, I'd probably get the black instead of the purplish. The color doesn't really look that nice through the grey case--first world problems...",2019年10月16日 在美国审核

"IMO, best budget phone","Camera quality: 5 stars in comparison to my previous phone, but I can't compare the premium phones.I consider this a budget phone, and for that it is a quality phone. Funny, the first charge lasted 3 days, but since then, I only get a little over one day. I don't use the phone much at all. Maybe it's one of my apps or its settings. I don't feel like deleting them all and adding one at a time to see.I don't need a phone with all the bells and whistles like wireless charging, so this phone was on the top of my list. It's faster than my Moto G5+, which was flaking out on bluetooth. No issues here.Beware that you only get high quality storage for free on Google photos for the 3A line, and you cannot fast charge with any cable/plug other than an OEM Google combo.

Occasional auto rotate issues. Lasted 20 months and hardware failure.,"Update: after 20 months of, admittedly high, usage, a hardware issue developed and the phone continues to crash after factory resets. Outside of that, the phone worked okay. Camera is clearly a decade behind my wife's five year old I-phone. And the auto rotate sticks sometimes. Also settings will randomly default (like auto rotate) so you end up having to go into settings every time only to see that, this time, it is just a glitch in a sensor, not a glitch in the software. Going Samsung 20 and see what dreams may come!Original review:I've owned mine for most of a year and it is not THAT bad but it is underwhelming. I bought this phone because I hate Apple products and their bourgeoisie hipster dufus ""we don't need two buttons on a mouse or even a 'back' button on an I-phone so you can go to a previous page directly instead of scrolling -- no, we're tot's gen fixed gear."" So I thought to myself, 'I don't care about graphics or quirky features, I just want a quality phone that makes calls and takes great pictures. The phone takes decent pictures but not in the same generation as my gfs I-phone. And by not the same generation, I don't mean annual generation of new tech, I mean human generation! If my 2001 1mega pixel flip phone is a 1 out of 10 and an I-phone is a 10, this is a 4.Also, the screen switching from side to upright either lags or doesn't work at all depending on it's mood. Other than that, the phone is not too bad. Just not worth any amount of brand loyalty.",2021年1月1日 在美国审核

Better than expected,"Let me start by saying that I've never used an iPhone. I have had a couple of the Galaxy S series phones but that was several years back (3&amp;4). I have been buying unlocked phones online for the last few purchases.I really like the Motorola/Lenovo line of unlocked mid-level hardware phones. The phones work well but the hardware was uninspiring.My last three unlocked phones were an Essential PH-1, Honor 7+ and a OnePlus 6T. Of those 3 it's hard to beat the 6T.Hardware is premium and the phone works well. The Essential phone felt great but the camera was average. I dropped the phone a few times and although the screen never cracked (it was in a case) the digitizer stopped responding. So, this was my replacement option.I really like this phone. The camera is pretty amazing for a 300 dollar phone. I challenge anyone to show me a phone at this price point with a better camera experience. I will say that I've noticed a 'processing' message in the bottom left corner of the camera interface when taking pictures under less than ideal conditions. I can only assume that is the software processing the images through whatever algorithm the Google engineers have come up with to create such strong results from a single camera. I assume that the top line Pixel phones with their higher end processors will be a little quicker in performing this function. I haven't found it to be an issue though.Although this is the cheaper of the pixel line of phones, it actually feels pretty solid. I'll try to update the review with a couple of non personal photos soon.I find the battery life to be adequate. It's not the best but I feel like it's good enough.If you want a phone with a pure Android experience, solid financial value and an amazing camera experience, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal than the Pixel 3A.",2019年11月27日 在美国审核
UPDATE (2/16/20): Good phone but app auto-update feature is TERRIBLE,"Bought this phone to replace an iPhone, so much of my experiences with the phone are in comparison to the iPhone. Generally, my impressions with this phone are positive; I like the screen size, the versatility, the range of apps available, the battery life, and quality of pictures. But there's one nagging problem that really bothers me: the extremely poor performance of the ""auto update"" feature for updating apps. To be clear, this feature works ~5% of the time. But the other 95% of the time it doesn't, and even when I try to force app updates, that usually happens is that the first app due for an update gets 99% downloaded, then gets stuck. And stays stuck. Even if I stop and restart the updates, it always does the same - gets to 99% and then gets stuck. I've found that sometimes when I clear the cache and data from the Play Store app, then the next update works OK. But I shouldn't have to manually go through this procedure every time my apps need updating. I NEVER had an app update problem with the iPhone. Please also note it's running Android vers 10. In hindsight, had I known of this problem, I likely would have bought a different brand ('cuz I don't know if this problem is limited to the 3a or if it affects all Google phones). Seriously, if the app auto-update feature works like it's supposed to, I'd give this phone 5 stars, and say it's a great replacement for an iPhone 7. Maybe if Google fixes this problem I'll come back and change my rating, but for now, 3 stars is all I can give.UPDATE (2/16/20): So automagically, the auto-update feature now seems to be working OK. My phone has been auto updating apps for the last ~2 weeks. I've not changed any settings, so I'm assuming the fix came with an unknown update from Google. I'm bumping my rating to 4 stars as a result. I can't go to 5 stars since the auto update feature wasn't working properly when the phone was delivered to me.",2020年1月19日 在美国审核

Phone Randomly Turns On and Off,"The Google Pixel 3a is a great phone when it is on. The problem is that the phone will randomly turn off without any warning. Over the past two days, my phone has randomly turned off about 3 times. Google support will ask if you've updated your phone (I have) and tried a factory reset (I have). After that, the support team will conclude that it is a hardware issue. In short, avoid this phone if you need to receive texts, emails, or calls.",2019年7月14日 在美国审核

Great phone for the price!,"I had my eye on this phone since I saw a commercial for it last year. I couldn't buy it until this year, however (thanks stimulus check!), but I'm glad I did! It's leaps and bounds better than the old LG G4 that I had for years. I really like how it comes with almost no bloatware, being an unlocked phone. It's my first time buying an unlocked phone, and I feel like it's the way to go.I did have a little trouble transferring SIM cards, since my old one was a micro instead of a nano, but my carrier gave me a new one free of charge. And that's in no way Google's or the seller's fault that my phone was so old.I like the different features that I've messed with so far. I'm sure I haven't discovered everything yet, but I can at least say that the UI looks great, it's much improved over what I had while still retaining the familiarity of Android.I have not taken any real photos with this phone yet, but if it's everything I've heard it to be, it should be great! I can't wait 'til all this pandemic stuff is over and I can start enjoying taking pictures again.I definitely recommend this phone if you're looking for something with great features for a price that won't empty your wallet.",2020年4月27日 在美国审核

don't like it,"The sound quality is so bad. I was trying to watch a youtube video on this phone and the video sounded like it was slightly muffled. Along with that I'm holding the phone on it's side and I keep blocking the sound somehow so I move my hand and the sound sucks anyway because it just sucks in general. I never had another phone where the sound just gets blocked somehow when holding it on the side. Another thing it that the aspect ratio of the phone is weirdly long so the screen just looks weird to me. I'm not sure if I'm remembering this part correctly but the even the blue light filter sucked. It just goes from white to super yellow and no inbetween. Lastly this is probably just because I'm used to a large size phone instead of a regular one, but the text is so tiny. I went on reddit and was like holy is the text so small so I increased the text and then I could barely read any paragraphs because to make the text a reasonable size it took up so much space on the screen.I don't know if the camera is great or not I only tried it out in dim light.",2019年7月23日 在美国审核

Excellent upgrade to Pure Android,"Decided to upgrade from Samsung Galaxy s8 because of s8's declining battery life and rumored lack of update to Android 10. Glad I made the switch. Other than larger and easier to read the battery life for the 3a xl is over one day, easy to navigate as there is no carrier bloatware, get immediate updates from Google, and has most if not all of the features that my Galaxy had.There are a couple of cons that while are not deal breakers should be noted and that is that there is no wireless charge capabilities and the top microphone hole looks surprisingly like a sim card ejection fitting. I would suggest that maybe Google should place a removable tag over the hole showing that it is not a sim card area. Moving from Samsung people could mistake the hole and try to insert the sim removal tray tool.All in all, this phone has excellent call reception and clarity both inbound and outbound. And, doesn't cost an arm and a leg!Update: Had an issue with the screen (operator error) and sent it back to the Google repair partner Cynergy in Grapevine Texas. Using the online form, got a RMA and put it in a FEDEX pick up box on Monday. The fixed (new screen) phone was back in my hands in perfect working order the following Monday morning. Excellent service at no cost to me as it was still under warranty. WOW!",2019年10月3日 在美国审核

My voice is garbled or it disappears all together. I have blown out the speakers, rebooted, pulled SIM card, etc, etc, etc. Nothing works. Although the rest of the Galaxy 3a is great, without a good phone the rest doesn't matter. I will probably sacrifice my photo quality for a better phone and go back to Samsung.

All those reviews aren't wrong - good solid phone for the next 3+ years,"FYI: You don't have to use the fingerprint reader or Google Assistant if you don't want to. Simply disable them. There are a couple of options the OS gives you off the bat on how you want to use 3a. Easy to customize, to a point. Not much bloatware to think of since most of android software are from Google. You can't uninstall, but you can disable them and get it out of your view.Pros:1. Camera/video - Night Sight = GOOD. It WORKS. An upgrade for those coming from Android 8 and below. If you want a decent camera for your vacations without buying yourself a DSLR, 3a has a solid camera for all your vacation needs.2. Battery life - decent. Can last 1 full day and more. Charges very quickly within ~15 mins. ""Slowly charging"" ~30 mins. The phone won't die if you forget to charge it when sleeping; it will still have plenty of % left in the morning. I have yet to get a black screen of death from this phone or have it run out of juice.3. Screen - good screen. Looks nice to watch YT.4. Bluetooth, audio, speaker - decent speaker. No crackling. It has an audio jack = perk in itself. Now I use it as a cell phone charm holder and primarily use Bluetooth headphone.5. Aesthetics - Color : not too bold with its ""purple-ish""; no tacky color scheme. Clearly plastic, but looks solid and hefty. You can feel the weight, but if you are looking for a slimmer design, this might not be it.6. OS (updates) - was able to immediately upgrade to 10. Easy to update toward latest patch. Straight from Google. I don't have to wait or have it fail to update for whatever reason. Should I want to upgrade, I can foresee 3a as an easy trade-in for the latest model, especially with how Google phones have made a mark with 3a.Cons/Meh:1. Internal storage - only 64 GB. No microSD port to increase storage, so bummer :\ But you do have cloud storage with Google Drive and Photo.2. Aesthetics - I actually like how it looks; it just how it feels to hold on your hand. Many have noted its slippery texture. I did not buy a Google Pixel case, but 3a will benefit from being in a case.This is a good, solid phone for a lot of people in different age groups. It even has various accessibility features for those who need to use their phone is a specific way. Good for teens, young adults, working people, and elderly. Pixel 3a will cover general everyday needs for everyone. All the reviews on the web are pretty accurate for recommending 3a for those who want a better phone for the general today.",2020年3月10日 在美国审核

"A very pleasant surprise, to find all my data transferred to this, my second smart phone.","The only thing that's less than perfect is that occasionally little bits of dust get in the speaker ports, and resulting sound is a little crackly, for a while.Google needs to get the word out, better, about how perfectly they actually backed up and transferred all the data, from my dead Nexus 5X to this Pixel 3a.I'd read, a few years before, that only one's apps, and none of their data, were backed up.I was prepared for a very sad, laborious process of rebuilding data.The actual process confused me, a bit, probably because I'm 61, and didn't grow up with these things.At first, I couldn't tell that anything was transferring to my new phone.And the interface was structured differently.On my previous phone, there was no swiping up for additional screens of activity.Close to a year later, this phone is a constant companion, making my cleaning job way more than bearable, even fun, by lettingme listen to podcasts.There's still plentyof unused storage, and I'm able to download new podcast episodes, every day, to play off-line and save on data costs.I bought my phone unlocked, so I could choose my own service provider, without being locked into a contract.I know there's no such thing as a free phone.I'm hoping this phone lasts more than 3 years.I can't afford to replace a phone more often than that.So far, so good.The only downside may be operator error.I struggle to use the fingertip identification unlocking feature.",2020年5月19日 在美国审核

Best Android Cell Phone I've Owned,"There is not much to dislike about this phone. It's not perfect, by any means. But, overall, it's a very good Android phone. Perhaps the best feature is that you get Android updates and security updates quickly, without waiting on the carrier to provide it, which often takes weeks or month. The phone's performance is good, the camera is good, the microphone is super sensitive, to a fault. I stood in my bedroom looking for my phone. To help find it, I said, ""Hey Google, what's the weather today?"" I spoke in a low to moderate voice, thinking the phone was in the same room I was in. But, when Google responded, the phone was in another room down the hall. Wow... kinda creepy, really. No, I know for sure I don't want a Google smart speaker. But, I love the phone. Best Android phone I've ever owned. One of the main reasons I bought this phone was for the large battery. However, the large screen and zippy processor apparently use a lot of juice. The battery doesn't last as long as the same size battery lasted in my Moto Z Play that this phone replaced.Still, does well.

Not Usable as Received &amp; Not Impressed,"I purchased this phone in Used - LIKE NEW condition from Amazon Warehouse.It was to replace a Motorola G4 that is 3 years old and starting to act a little sluggish.I was quite excited to receive my Google Pixel 3a XL, especially to use the camera.This is my review for the very short period of time I had the phone.The phone had a nice feel, very similar to my Moto G4... ever so slightly taller and just a tad narrower.The display was fine and had no issues there.Basic operation was very smooth and fast.That is where the excitement ended and the disappointments began...I was extremely excited to try this highly rated camera... and boy was I disappointed.I was comparing shots taken with both the Pixel 3a XL and my Moto G4 (3 year old technology and not a very expensive phone at the time).All the pictures taken with the Pixel seemed a bit washed out... like too much light.Each phone's camera was set to Auto with HDR off.The Pixel did do slightly better in a couple pics taken in a darker room with no lights on.I also tried taking some video... the Moto G4 results were far superior.Probably needless to say but I was quite surprised about all this.Another thing I noticed as I was taken photos was there was no shutter sound... you know that little clicking sound that lets you know yes, I got the pic.Well nothing... and then I realized I hadn't heard any sound at all for anything coming from this Pixel phone - and so I went to all the settings under camera and main settings to make sure the sound option was on and then I went to You Tube to play a music video... and guess what, no sound whatsoever!So just a couple of hours into having this supposedly fine phone with a magnificent camera do I find it has no sound and the photos taken with the camera are beyond disappointing:(So I was not sure how I should feel about this phone/camera that I so excitedly had waited for.Did I just get a 'lemon', the bad 'needle in the haystack'?After all I did buy a USED (though noted ""LIKE NEW"") phone... but was this the real problem here?Needless to say I immediately packed up the phone and returned it.I have since researched online and did read of some problems having to do with sound on the Pixel phones, so now I'm not sure what to do.Can I recommend this phone... sorry, but I certainly can not.The Pixel 3a XL may not be considered a 'flagship' phone that cost ridiculous amounts of money, but it certainly is not a cheap phone when spending almost $400 on a Used, Like New model... I certainly expected a lot more from this Google phone and I definitely didn't get it.For now I'll stick with my Moto G4, sluggish and all... for after all, it does have SOUND and takes pretty darn GOOD PHOTOS &amp; VIDEO too.I still would like to think that this phone was the exception and that the Google Pixel 3a XL is all that it was hyped up to be.Or I wonder if others have had the same experience I had and came away disappointed.Please let me know in the comments section...

Great phone...  IF the speakerphone works(known issue of this phone)!!!,"Awesome camera for sure.Software is fairly nice, yet Google Pixel phones still may need some modifications to bring some excellent features that are sadly missing(such as delayed text, removal of Google bar, back/home/recents non-customizable by deafult, and most importantly NOTIFICATION LIGHT! is missing so a workaround is needed).3.5mm headphone jack(yet no FM radio) is very nice IMHO, size is very nice, battery is just fine for my usage, USB-C, ear speaker is clear and fairly loud, cellular signal seems to be at least as good as any other phone I've used, etc.Now a warning regarding Amazon orders;Amazon is extremely difficult to contact for support.Individual sellers on Amazon can be some real trouble(no phone calls returned, no response from Amazon messages, and very confusing and poorly written return policies).I will likely avoid at all costs any future purchases this method since it has been an expensive headache to deal with a phone that obviously didn't even get the basic quality control assurance testing done and needing to contact support for critical questions has been nothing but a nightmare.With a decade+ on a competitor marketplace, I think I will stay with them for purchasing anything other than direct from Amazon as their communications is top-notch in comparison and flawless service for coming to resolutions if a problem does occur.In conclusion;Really disappointed with Amazon seller customer service and Amazon's resolution center when an issue does arise!UPDATE:second phone bought off Amazon and came with non-functioning Android software(Your device is corrupt).Further supporting my initial conclusion(also another seller that did not honor my request for a telephone call).",2021年2月18日 在美国审核

Five month review: Worst electronics purchase in a decade.,"By far the worst phone I've ever purchased.My old $200 android phone from a Chinese manufacture worked better than the Goolge Pixel 3a XL.The camera app freezes, sometimes for 10 min and I have to restart the phone.Otherwise the fact that the camera is outstanding is the only positive hardware I've found on the phone. The two features that are actually well done are the ability to squeeze the phone and turn off alarms or incoming calls. Second, double press the power button and the camera comes up.Pretty much every other aspect is below the market standard. The fact that there is no indicator light is simply unacceptable and I wish I knew that fact prior to purchasing.Often times apps crash for no reason. Overall the Google operating system is just horrible, and I've had the phone for five months.The battery life is only slightly better than my five year old phone, and last for a day and a half on average.Overall I expected much more from Google.",2019年12月18日 在美国审核

Best phones we've ever owned,"We've been iPhone owners for nearly a decade. After all the constant changes, forcing to face ID on most units, prices being jacked up, no headphone jack (really prices you out if you don't want BT headphones or dealing with charging them, etc), and just never ending issues with our iPhones (updates crashing apps, black screens, Apple always blaming us for any issues, even though we dropped thousands on Apple products at the time). We decided to finally move away from Apple and into a more affordable ecosystem.Over 6 months later, so glad! Never turning back. Apples new budget phone with the SE is a total joke and ripoff to loyal Apple fans (of which I was 20 years).

Thank you Google.And no, I don't care if Google doesn't offer as much customer service or Applecare etc, those are all gimmicks, because when the time came to get help from Apple, they never could be counted on!

Not very impressed. Problems with speakers,"First, I had a Google pixel first generation and loved it, so I upgraded to the pixel 3a because it was less expensive than the 3 and after reading reviews, it sounded like a good alternative. This being said, I love the camera quality on this phone as well as the design. It's lightweight and battery life is good, but could be better. It lasts maybe a full day depending on how much you use your phone. However, within the first couple weeks of having it, I had to call customer service because while taking videos there was a high pitch noise. I was told this is because of Google voice. I turned Google voice off and it took care of the issue, however now I can't utilize Google voice. Now, I'm having a new problem. Mind you, I've only had the phone since December, only 4 months. My phone no longer has a ringtone or any message notification sounds. It started with a crackle in the bottom speaker that I noticed one evening and the same evening all notifications ceased. It will only vibrate. I can still listen to other media, but I have no notification sounds. I miss phone calls and do not know when someone messages me. If I turn Bluetooth on, I can get incoming calls and messages through that speaker, but as soon as I turn it off my phone only vibrates, no sound.

"Wi-fi calling should work, but doesn't for me so far.  The new version is completely unlocked.","Note I am reviewing the new version of the Pixel 3a XL.As I read in another review the battery charge indicator was strange in the beginning but seems to become more accurate with time.First thing I did was charge it.When I plugged it in, it said 78%.I changed it with the fast charger it came with for about 45 minutes, after which it said 68% charge.Used it for about a half an hour and it was about 45% which seemed like a fast drain.But after a few charge cycles it seemed to last about a day and half before getting from 100% to 40%.The battery seems like new even though it may have been on a shelf for years.Wi-fi calling: (which was the main reason I got the phone) should be on the phone.I use PureTalk MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) that Uses AT&amp;T towers.So I call their tech support and give them my phone's IMEI # (a must for wi-fi calling to work), and they activated wi-fi calling for my IMEI and sim.They reset the phone which is the same as taking out the sim and putting it back in.No wi-fi calling shows up.I check for system updates: none.I remove the sim and put it back: no change.I download the wi-fi calling Webjet from the play store: nothing.I reset my network settings: no change.I haven't tried I third party app work around yet-- maybe that would work.I am used to cheep $150 unlocked phones.I was never able to stream news video while driving with those cheep phones: audio only, yes, but never video.This phone can stream video news through an MVNO which is a second class mobile LTE connection.I don't know why, but it just downloads faster than my old Samsung Galaxy J6+ on the same LTE network.Everything worksgrate.Supper fast 5gig wi-fi, finger print reader, starting apps, and connecting apps to the internet either through wi-fi or mobile.The speakers sound richer and deeper than my old phone.The camera is spectacular.If anyone has any suggestions about how to get wi-fi calling to work please reply to my review.",2021年2月18日 在美国审核

"Great camera, but other than that it's a terrible phone","The camera is fantastic, especially night view. It's one of the reasons why I bought this phone. But everything else about it has been utterly disappointing. Here are my biggest issues with it:<br>1. I bought this phone to replace my 3-year-old Moto G5. I was hoping the battery life would be much better than my old phone's, but it was actually about the same! This phone, straight out of the box, can only last a day without recharging. I'm not even streaming hours of video on it. Just normal use for browsing, GPS and texting. And it doesn't come close to my Moto G5's battery when it was new.2. It doesn't use a normal USB cord. I had to purchase special USB-C cords just for this phone, and transferring files from my phone to my Mac is a pain.3. Various software issues that are also documented by other users on the internet, e.g. the speaker produces a cracking noise at certain frequencies if I play media after making a phone call, so I have to restart the phone every time after making a call. Chrome also doesn't open 4 times out of 5.4. The swype keyboard is too sensitive to changes in pressure. If I decrease the pressure slightly, it records a break.5. I don't like the fact that the fingerprint reader is on the back. I have to flip it over or lift it up to unlock it if it's lying on the table.Very disappointed with this phone and will never buy a Google phone again!</br>",2020年7月29日 在美国审核

"Google, I thought we were cool but I'm questioning your loyalty to me","This thing is a bit of a piece of crap. I bought one for me and one for a family member. I use mine way more. I haven't even had it a year and often times the screen lags when I click on something like email to open up from the home screen. I don't have a ton of apps installed. I clear the cache. Sometimes it takes forever to send a text or they don't go through at all. Sometimes I can't download a message, especially on a group chat. I don't believe that's a network issue because they are coming in like hotcakes but not downloading. Super frustrating.The camera is the best part, I use it for some YouTube videos. The battery is still ok but has not been without draining issues before. I sometimes charge it twice a day. I don't know if that's normal or not. It's just sitting there some days.Originally I was stoked to buy this and I read good things but have really been unimpressed. I thought this phone would last a while but I don't know that it will.

GOOGLE 3a WINS!!,"My new favorite phone!At first I couldn't decide between this or the Pixel 4 XL.Deciding factors were the longer battery life and the fingerprint scanner.I need my phone to last me all day.The Pixel 4has some really cool features but I read the battery life leaves much to be desired.The fingerprint scanneris a must for me with apps, such as my banking app, that gives you the option to log in via fingerprint; rather than typing in a password.This is a plastic phone and though not premium materials, it is going to go into a case anyway.Same goes with the ""Dragontrail"" glass screen.I put a premium glass screen on the front... PROBLEM SOLVED.Headphone jack is a convenient option that I like and the pictures with this phone come out beautiful!For your average consumer, this is a fantastic option at a fantastic price!Fully unlocked to work on any carrier.Good old-fashioned, bare-bones operating system and I love it!No bloatware; just fast Android that works!Did I mention you also get dual speakers?Sounds like a winner to me!",2020年5月16日 在美国审核

Great phone for the price,"Well I've had this for a while now, i got this because of my needs, a good camera and because android and i switched from an iphone 8plus, the camera quality is amazing on the pixel, the oled screen is really impressive, since I've never seen an oled before, only down side is the chipset and ram management, it lags here and there, but not something you'll really notice, but the ram management is kinda bad, you'll leave an app and when you come back it has to load all over again but in my iphone itll be back where i left it but it's something you can get used to, You won't find a better phone for the price , and did i mention the camera?

Best mid-range phone the market today!,"This is a great phone for the money!The OLED screen looks great and is plenty bright, the phone seems fast even though the processor is mid-level speed, and it is unlocked so will work with any carrier - in short, a great value for someone that doesn't want to spend north of $800 for a fancy phone!The camera is superb - on a par with much more expensive phones!It doesn't have the usually installed bloatware found on most other phones (even NO facebook, yay!), but there is a lot of Google software that you will want to review before using.Be careful with giving the Google apps permissions if you have security/privacy concerns - true on any phone.Though the phone is constructed with polycarbonate materials, not glass or metal, it still feels great in my hand with a good solid feel to its construction.Finally, the pure Google Pie operating system is a joy to use!There are many other features that work well on this device, but I would run very long on this review - check out the mostly positive reviews on the web for more info.Did I mention I love this phone?",2019年6月29日 在美国审核
LASTED EXACTLY 1 YEAR AND CRASHED,"I was happy with this phone even though I didn't really think the features warranted the high price.The camera wasn't any better, and in fact was worse than, some of my previous phones.I didn't have strong enough feelings one way or the other to write a review until now.2 weeks past the one year mark of the date that I received it, it just crashed.Prior to crashing, I started to see a pink hue to the screen color and then one day while I was listening to music it suddenly decided to restart itself, but just stuck right there in the restarting mode.Couldn't turn it on or off.It just kept trying to restart until the battery went dead.When I charged it, it came up with an android crash message, but neither option provided did anything.I guess I'll go back to a less expensive phone because they do just as well IMO.",2020年11月23日 在美国审核

"Good phone, ringtone much too low","I've had the Pixel 3a XL for about 9 months, and I like it quite a bit.There's one big disadvantage:the maximum ringtone is much too quiet.I've often missed calls because I didn't hear the phone ring.If I have the phone in my hand, I'll hear it.But if it's sitting on a counter across the room, I may not hear the ring at all.I've had cell phones for a long time, including other smart phones, and this is the first time I've ever had this problem.Research online suggested that this is a Google design problem, and that Google doesn't acknowledge it or do anything to fix it.Next time I will buy a different phone.Other than that, it's a great phone.I like the size, big enough to read web pages without quite as much scrolling, and big enough to see photos well.I don't have any problems holding it or manipulating the controls.The camera is excellent.The speed is quite good.I got the 64GB version, and have had plenty of room for apps.The unbloated Android OS is great, and gets updated quickly.If not for the ringtone issue, I'd give it 5 stars.But missing calls?Hey, that's what a phone is for.I'm probably being generous at 3 stars overall.",2020年4月2日 在美国审核

"Low price, low storage, unpolished dual SIM","Generally a good phone with all the Google stuff, much better battery life than the Pixel 4. I get 36 hours of light to medium usage and never have to worry about it. The small storage 64GB is a problem if you do a lot of videos, and Google limits the amount stored in the cloud unless you pay extra.This phone can handle two SIMs, one physical and one electronic. It does not work great because I have Google Fi for both SIMs, which shows very confusing messages as to which phone number I am using for text messages. Talked toGoogle and they said it will be sent to their engineering team for evaluation.Also, the phone may be too new and some Apps may not work. For example, Adobe Photoshop Fix cannot be installed, saying it is incompatible, even though it installed on a 1G Pixel and a Pixel 3a. Separately, Adobe is completely inept at understanding this problem, I have gotten 15 emails from Adobe asking me to explain my problem even though I gave them screen shots and all the details.",2020年1月15日 在美国审核

So many things I hate about this phone,"This is the worst phone I have ever had! I hate it NEVER goes completely dark when asleep, I hate it ""mutes"" your caller randomly (they can hear you but you cannot hear the caller in the middle of a conversation, sometime upon answering......), the battery sucks (I keep it on power saver mode all the time)! My cheap Honor 6 lasted all freaking day (this maybe lasts half a day with hardly any use at all), I hate if you just touch the damn phone it comes on, I HATE all the ringtones and notification tones (so quiet and low. ALL of them), the volume is week and low, the alarms are not fully customizable for repeat alarms....ughh..so much I hate about this stupid phone! I will update as remember all the things. Huawei Honor is such a better phone for the money. Weird brand and all but great phone. I regret not buying another one. I cannot make or receive calls randomly.",2020年6月4日 在美国审核
Hits and exceeds the mark on nearly everything,"First of all, the camera is top notch and makes me wonder why all these new phones need 3-4 lenses to do half the job this phone does. I've attached some photos - note that none of these were a real attempt to catch anything spectacular but I was really impressed, especially with the one of my dog, Marley. I took that picture after 8pm; typically a photo after dark or in low light is pointless and looks terrible, even with a fantastic flash on most phones. Here, you can see my girl's beautiful eyes and the textured sky wonderfully. Portrait mode is snazzy; I used it on the pumpkin cake. Zero complaints and nothing but praise for the camera!Fingerprint unlock is the most responsive and quick of any phone I've had.Wifi picks up wonderfully and scrolling is fluid with no lag on any app.Storage could be better at 64GB but I have tons of apps loaded on mine and still have plenty of space. For heavy picture-takers, just use the Google Cloud storage rather than downloading a gallery and you'll be set.Call quality is fantastic! I'm in rural Alabama and typically am lucky to get one bar on my phone; I could barely send a text on my previous android. On my Pixel 3a, I can make a call from anywhere in my house - rather than going outside and standing on my tippy-toes. :)Battery life is not anything to brag on but isn't terrible, I guess. I'm coming from a Blu Life One X3, which on average lasted a solid 2.5-3 days with average use. To be fair, it was running a 5,000 mAh battery while the Pixel is only 3,000. That said, this phone taps out in about a day. If you disable the always on display, that'll save you some energy. It's really just about finding what works with your needs. I've had this one running from a 100% charge to 63% in 5 hours, but that's with running Pandora some and several apps using push notification. On the plus, the phone does charge in an hour and a half as advertised.It came with a transfer thingydo that made transferring every-single-item from my previous phone a dream. Within like 30 minutes, I had every text, photo, app, and even my recent call list moved over seamlessly.I've not messed with the Google Assistant features much but I can already tell they're very sensitive and work wonderfully. It'll help you with about any task you need and has spot-on GPS for hard to find spots on the map.9/10 for a grand score, only because the battery is meh. Otherwise, the Pixel 3a is a must-buy. I'm a week in and convinced.",2020年5月13日 在美国审核

BEST PICTURES I have ever taken were on this phone.,"Oh Google. I am usually aGalaxy Girl. Had three of the same class consecutively for some years. Then I got tired of the high pricetag.Enter Google Pixel 3.... I like it overall. It doesn't brush your hair or make you richer looking... but for significantly less than iPhone which charges an arm, a leg and your dogs teeth....I think it's an alright phone.I am young...early thirties with children. I am not a photographer but boy, does this phone have some nice shots. I walk around telling people I am a self-made photographer. Don't be fooled by the advertisements surrounding other megalodon-type mobiles. This phone has some of the best picture quality of any phone I've had before.PHOTOS::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::If you are into having beautiful crisp and sharp images, this phone has the best quality and for me... beats the other two and any other phone I've researched. I am a lunatic when it comes to researching...i.e. I use my Google pixel to split screens and look at multiple phones side by side and compare every little detail. LolI digress. Just an example to explain my theory better: we took a trip to Colorado, by far one of the most beautiful landscapes the eyes could see. I don't have the ability to go to Colorado every year and so I really wanted pictures that would capture that moment with my family.At the time it was 2017 and I had a different random phone. Now that I look back at my thousands of photos in Google photos, I realize the quality was somewhat grainy and didn't capture the light the way I wanted it to.I am a lover of everything beautiful and nature. I love to capture the simple moments in life and the memorable ones with crisp, sharp and alluring photos and to relive those moments with nostalgia. This phone has hands down the best photo quality. I have researched it to be true (since a few months ago) and I can wholeheartedly say that the evidence speaks for itself. If you want to see every blade of grass, this phone will get you pretty close.I attached some pictures. I wrote Google/Samsung/iPhone on the pictures to show the difference in quality. The picture of myrose from my rose bush has won alot of recognition from a gardening photography group. They couldn't believe it wasn't an expensive phone or DSLR camera.Now the bad.......I gave it four stars yes....it does have some issues but I can say with experience that it is due to my own errors.GAMING ABILITIES::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I am an avid gamer. I play sometimes for hours on end, on this phone. In terms of ease of play, Google Pixel is easy to use, handling is fair and the brightness/ visuals are absolutely fine. Maybe not perfect but for the price it's pretty powerful. But if you're into gaming for eSports and making a living playing video games, maybe find a more gamer-friendly phone. You know, one that doesn't take fine pictures. ;)The bad issue with this phone which I knowingly blame on myself is that my screen has a somewhat faint shadow on the background that never goes away. I know from experiencethat my last non-google phonehad it too. This is not due to the phone being bad quality but is just a natural cause of the phone keeping one screen on for a long time and in essence that image being burned into the screen. I am not aware of the term for this but hubby is a computer science/math background and explained this to me.In my case, I had left this notoriously large sized game running in the background a whole entire night. The image burned into the retina display and is forever a part of the phone.CAPABILITIES &amp; MISCELLANEOUS:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::I will not go into detail about GB/ram, storage, battery, chargers, or anything else which can be easily compared online. If I did my review would be a novel. But overall, it is fairly decent in these other important departments. The battery is akin to my other phones I've had. Pretty strong. The storage is true to size. The chargers I had no issue with but I have a horrible habit of using my phone while it's charging.Don't do this.There are some cool functions which other phones didn't have from my experience.This phone let's you choose and set times for the night light...which is a blue light filter. There is of course an option for a dark theme, an option to invert colors, to save your battery by shutting off other apps, there's a lot of ability to choose what you want to see or don't. You can of course split the screen which makes a world of difference when listening to music while texting or typing or reading an important article. Security works really well and is helpful to bundle with ease for Google play, Gmail, and other Google office apps. Just perfect.Mind you, there's a lot that other companies i.e., Samsung or iPhone or other competitors might be able to match or excel and some which they cannot. But the main reason this phone stands out is due to its affordability and the superior pictures, the no- nonsense ease of use, it's matching power to the more expensive phones. It is clutter free, allows you more control with your apps and interface.Overall, this phone has not let me down and if you are like me, and can do without the frillyand minute yet unnecessary extras that come with the more popular phones, this phone will truly be a joy to use.The fact that this phone still runs and works with my notoriously bad behaviors should speak volumes. As well as the fact that my more careful significant other has his phone in pristine condition when he bought his months before mine.....this too should sway you into giving the more affordable phone a chance. And stop following crowds or false advertisement. Do your research before making a large purchase and remember most phones all do the same things. The small differences are about what you want to give and take for your own needs in a phone.The pictures I put are of landscapes and food and whatnot just to show you the difference in quality as well as similarities. In the end price becomes a factor. I tried to post all three popular phones in similar settings captured over the past 7 years to better show the differences.The photos with this phone are absolutely clearer and more defined. There's more options with focusing the pictures as well. Blurring the background...you can make that an automatic feature and much much more.I have had the phone almost two years now. Will buy another one of these when its' time runs out. It's so not worth the extra money to buy more expensive phones especially when you prefer to have beautiful and crisp photos to remember your photos by and can do without the extra filler ""features"".Good luck in life whatever your choices!!!!",2020年9月19日 在美国审核

"Nearly perfect, but may not hold up over time","This nearly took the top seat for best smartphone I've ever used. It has everything I want and nothing more. No gimmicky bells and whistles to annoy me and make sales, just a plain USEFULL smartphone. I love the polycarbonate build, it in no way feels cheep to me. It never gets hot, and it looks super clean. The screen is great, nothing to complain about there. Of course the camera is what you would expect out of a Google device, great photo and video capability. I really wish I could give this 5 stars but unfortunately, I have encountered a design flaw of the device. After about 3 months of careful use (always in a case, screen protector, never in my back pocket) the phone chassis has developed a bend. The phone is still operating perfectly fine, no cracks on the screen or body. It has just a very slight twist in it. I noticed it when I placed it on my counter and it did not lay flat. You can see the bend if you look along the edges of the phone. Google's response to this problem is that it is ""within the operating limits of the polycarbonate case."" This phone, in my opinion, is nearly perfect in every other way. For the price I still reccomend it, but just want to send a word of caution to those who may be a bit rougher with thier devices that this may not be a phone that will stand the test if time.",2020年4月25日 在美国审核

It was super frustrating to have transferred all his data to the new phone, realized the speakers didn't work, transfer everything back to old phone, return the new phone and order yet another new phone after receiving a refund. The whole process took a solid 2 weeks, only to receive another phone where the internal speaker does not work ( he can't hear phone calls).

But I was pleasantly surprised to see good build quality and the materials feel as if they belong on a more expensive phone. Camera quality is great and Google has made it clear that they will prioritize software over hardware, as far as camera is concerned, to deliver good quality.

But you also get a lot of integrated features from Google that I've become a big fan of - Google Assistant has proved more useful for someone like me who doesn't like to talk to his phone than Siri ever did.But for the dollar value I don't have a single regret. I happily forewent niceties like wireless charging and waterproofing to get this cheaper version of the Pixel 3, and it doesn't feel cheap in terms of construction and durability. I needed something with a built in headphone jack to be compatible with my car stereo, which is what drew me to the Pixel 3a in the first place.",2019年6月28日 在美国审核
"Super Useful, Maybe Perfect","Straight-forward functionality and long battery life are my two criteria for a new phone. I care little about cutting edge tech not yet mass tested. Mostly I just want to forget about the phone and just use it, not spend time clearing memory and monkeying with settings or signals. I have yet to run this phone down below 35% in a single day, often I can go much more than a day without charging. On the new Sprint/T-Mobile network I have zero problems finding a signal. Wi-Fi connects seemlessly. The current Android build seems to.take care of memory issues and pop-ups. And this phone itself just seems to get out of the way and let me use the apps as written.If I had a complaint, I guess it's that this phone seems too smooth and I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Even iPhones have occasional issues, just because they're not magical.",2020年7月23日 在美国审核

No Help When It Breaks,"I bought this phone from Amazon because I wanted to use Spectrum Mobile, and to buy a phone through them, I had to be home to accept UPS or Fed Ex delivery of a phone.I work.I wasn't taking a day off from work to wait for a delivery.The Pixel phone from Amazon was fine. It takes great pictures, it connected to my home Wifi, which is what I needed since I don't have cell service here.All was good.Fast forward 6 months.When I tried to make a call, I would get a message that said I was not connected to wifi and that I needed to connect to wifi to make a call.But when I went into the phone settings, it said that I was indeed connected to my home wifi.This past week, the problem was no longer intermittent.I can now no longer make any calls or get any texts in our out.I called Amazon, and they said I needed to contact Google, but they weren't allowed to give me the number.I Googled a number, but when I called, it said that, because of the COVID outbreak, no one was answering the phone.I had to connect via Google ads.I tried going on Google's various websites, but when I clicked on Contact Us, nothing happened.I eventually learned that I could not contact Google using Internet Explorer,I had to use Google Chrome.Go figure.So I opened a Google support website, and when I clicked on Contact Us I got an opportunity to do a live chat.I was happy.It asked me to explain my problem.I did.Then an agent came on line, and his first question was to ask me what the problem was.So do they have me type my problem before the agent comes on line just for the exercise?He did figure it out before I finished repeating the problem, and he told me he'd check it out.After an interminable wait, he came back to the chat and said I can't use my cell phone if I don't have cell service.I told him that isn't true because I've been using it for the past 6 months.He then started to tell me about this wonderful thing called wifi calling and gave me a link to my wifi provider's information about wifi calling.In all capital letters with exclamation marks, I told him I know about wifi calling, have been using wifi calling, and the problem is that the phone isn't working.He asked me to explain what I meant when I said the phone isn't working.I asked how I get the phone repaired under warranty.He said the fastest way was to contact the service center.But what he gave me was the phone number and web address, it was for ubreakifix.com.Never will I EVER buy another Google product.",2020年5月2日 在美国审核

"Beware of Warranty - broken phone is replaced with refurbished phone, not a new phone","Read the fine print on the one year warranty!If you return the phone under warranty, Google may replace it with a refurbished phone.I can't believe this.My refurbished phone could very well be older than the 3A XL that I originally purchased!I think this is wrong, wrong, wrong!I experienced a hugh inconvenience because my front facing camera broke.I went through all the suggested steps to troubleshoot it myself, then spent two days going through the same steps again via Google's online chat service with two different representatives.ThenGoogle had me take the phone for repair to ubreakifix.Now these guys kept the phone over the weekend, but still couldn't fix it - and I know they tried hard and spent numerous hours.Then I had to Fedex it to Google and waited 7 days to get my replacement phone, thinking it would be a brand new phone.Nope!For a new phone to break within the first year is bad enough, but after all the inconvenience the buyer goes through, you would think Google would be honorable enough to send a new phone.No way!Now I have to set up my used replacement phone and pray that it works!",2020年10月12日 在美国审核

The camera is the only reason I went with the Pixel line again. Battery is very poor for the specs on this phone, speakersare just awful compared to the older 2XL and crackle ALOT at higher volumes. Screen is ok, not as vibrant as the 2XL. 64gb of storage is acceptable I guess but no micro SD expansion is one of the bad choices Google made with the entire Pixel line. On the plus side there is a headphone jack so that's good I guess? This is just a holdover until the Samsung Galaxy 11 line is out or phones start making solid state batteries the norm.

Adequate but beware of limitations,"This was a very easy phone to set up and migrate from a Galaxy.User interface is intuitive and battery life is exceptional (so far).I have owned it for 3 weeks now so have been able to give it a good once over.Negatives are there is no dot notification on the 3a so it requires you to turn on the phone to check for emails, texts, etc.I also use wifi calling extensively as At&amp;t. has a poor signal in my neighborhood.Wifi calling works but tends to drop any call longer than about 15 minutes.Not a huge deal for me as I'm retired and doing long work related calls anymore but it could be an issue for many.I will most likely keep the phone as the price was right, setup was easy and functionality is adequate for me at this stage in my life.Not sure that would have been the case if using for work.",2019年10月7日 在美国审核
I really wanted to like this phone...,"I had always wanted to buy a pixel ever since the first one was released. but they had always been on the high side of the cost spectrum. When Google announced 3a, I said to myself finally! I saved up and got the phone. My first impression of the phone was ""WOW! I love it!"". Aesthetically, the phone looks absolutely stunning.I am one of those people who doesn't put his stuff into the cloud, so I had to sit down for four hours to move my data, contacts etc. over to the phone. This is when I started noticing some differences. Understandably, the phone was different to the touch. A very common observation when moving from one manufacturer to another. I thought, oh no problem, let's adjust the screen sensitivity and surprise! It is an add on feature, not present in vanilla android. Oh well, its just one thing. After that I ran into issues while setting a custom ringtone. Turns out that you have to move the file to a specific folder and restart the phone and it goes on.. I ran into a few such 'issues' but I thought that it was probably just the transition to the new phone. Camera on the phone by the way is phenomenal!Anyway, a few days later I started noticing how I am missing calls. The phone is next to me but it doesn't ring. I made sure all the do not disturb stuff is off, made sure the volume is max. I even changed by ringtone! For some reason, my own ringtone sounded really low on the phone. I went to one the pixel sounds, but still had issues getting calls. This is when I started thinking that perhaps I should return this phone, but I still persisted partly because I liked it overall, and partly because I didn't want to transfer data again. The final straw came a few days ago when I missed a very important call from my wife's doctor. That day we both sat down and she called my phone. To our surprise, the phone didn't ring. Her phone showed that it was ringing. Right after I unlocked it, I got a missed call! Pixel forums online had tons of such reports. Honestly, if a phone can't fulfill its main purpose of being able to receive a call without issues, I don't need it. I initiated a return today (with a sorry heart, I really wanted to like this phone..). Part of me is also angry since it ended up being a huge waste of time. I will have to redo the whole data transfer.Overall,PROS: excellent camera, clean Android and Google assistant + call screeningCONS: sound quality is awful, you run into issues with missing functionality that you are generally used to and the OS has bugs",2019年7月29日 在美国审核
"not a good product to buy, not reliable internal parts and looks cheap internal parts.","i bought pixel 3A in Dec and buy March (just 3 months) the loudspeaker stopped working, caused me to miss some important calls as there was no ringtone sound (due to bad loudspeaker) and i couldn't see any videos as no sound. Thus looks like Google uses very cheap internal components to build Pixel phone.Thus i called customer care for repair they provided to use walkin using uBreakiFix store. Since the product is under warranty i went to the store and they dis a inspection of the device and they told that there is very minor crack on the corner of the screen the store person told that the warranty is void due to this damage and now i need to pay full for screen damage and loudspeaker damage too (which is half the price of new device). Since the crack is so minor &amp; is is at the extreme corer it doesn'timpact any functionality.Customer care says loudspeaker repair will be covered under warranty, but uBreakiFix says Google has to send lead to them, later customer care says send the device directly to them rather than UBIF. so i'm like ping pong ball struggling to get the repair done.i had motorola in past for more that 4-5 years and never had any issue but even buying a branded phone (Google) you expect the device to work much reliably.

Great Phone! Great Camera! Worth the Pricetag!,"I got this because I had a VERY old phone, a Galaxy On5, that was starting to go bad. I chose this Pixel model because it has a headphone jack.Compared to that old phone, this knocks it out of the park! It also came earlier than expected by about 2 days, so that was another big plus!The camera quality in the daylight is GORGEOUS, but as far as the night vision on it goes, I'm a little lost? When there's a heavy lack of light, it performs okay if a bit grainy, but the night mode where you have to hold it still for about five seconds... It's subpar. I tried capturing a picture of a bunny and it was very blurry.The battery life is really good, about what can be expected of a new phone. It charges very quickly in my opinion, about 50% faster than my old phone back when it was new, so that's really pleasing!Overall it's a wonderful phone and the price tag is worth it, especially when you have comparable phones selling for 1k (gross)!

Embrace the botnet!,"Are you the kind of person who would buy a Toyota Camry with a V6 or a BMW 7-series with a turbocharged V8? The BMW is a gorgeous car, but:- costs a pile- has buttons you'll never figure out- if you do, you'll never use half of them- do people really switch between comfort/comfort+/sport/etc?- do people really study the engine specs on the display?- you'll really be crying if you wreck itNow, nobody will ever mistake a Camry for a BMW. But it's a fine car, has some nice features, plenty of legroom, decent bluetooth, lane warning, radar cruise control, looks sharp etc. It's nice! However, it's going to take you longer to pass a semi than the BMW will. And it doesn't have half the features the BMW does. But you'll feel a lot less bad when you wreck it.This is the difference between the 3A XL and, say, the Galaxy S20. The main deal is the 3A has the Snapdragon 670 vs the 865 in the S20. It's the difference between a V6 and a V8. Does the 670 do okay? Absolutely. Most of the time you won't be able to tell that you have a less powerful chip and that's much to google's credit. About the only time I notice it is when scrolling through photos and pics, there's a very slightly longer--but noticeable--load time. For other tasks like email, web browsing, games, vids? I can't tell. I upgraded from the S8, which was a flagship at the time and has the Exynos chip, and the S8 is snappier but I can only tell under specific circumstances, like lists of pics. The rest of the time I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE.This phone is considered a midrange because of the engine, the Snapdragon 670. It's the same size (dimensions) as the FruitFone 7+, so not as large as I was expecting. But the best part?- no notchlol- no holelol- HEADPHONE JACK!- no bloatware- pure droid- not idiotically priced like FruitFone and (unfortunately) Scamsung.And that, my friends, is worth the price of admission. But it's gooooogle! It's the botnet!! Dude, you're on Android which is already the biggest botnet in the world (fruitfone is no distance behind at all). Don't be fooled into thinking there's anything like real privacy. To get anything close to that you've got to go the distance with a fone that lets you unlock the bootloader (chinese brands) and flash a custom rom and who cares? Now: the thing doesn't accept an SD card and you're limited to 50-some GB after the OS loads, so if you're a packrat you'll need to do a little space management.My recommendation is to wait for this to go on sale and then pull the trigger.

"Great camera, clean software, adequate phone","The main reason for getting this phone is the camera. The hardware itself is not that amazing, it's Google's software that makes it spectacular. A $400 phone having a camera this good is incredible.The other reason for getting this phone is the pure Android experience. I don't care for most skins and custom UIs. Most manufacturers, however, seem to have learned that less is more when it comes to customizing the Android UI for their phones, so this is less of an issue today than it was in years past.Having Google's guarantee of software updates is also very important to me.One other nice feature of the phone is that it has a headphones jack, but no longer has a notification light. I'm somewhat irked by the lack of a notification light, since there's ample space on the bezel for one.Features I'd like to have but find acceptable to be missing in a $400 phone: no wireless charging, no waterproof certification, no extra camera lenses.What I don't quite care for on the phone: slow fingerprint reader, only 4GB of RAM.Comparing this phone to a 2.5 year old OnePlus 3T:1. Fingerprint reader is much faster on the 3T2. Performance on T-Mobile is about the same as on the 3T (I moved the same SIM over to the Pixel 3a) despite the 3T lacking bands 66 and 71. It might be slightly better in some situations. For example, while I occasionally lose mobile Internet on my 3T at work (despite it saying I have LTE), I haven't encountered the same problem on the 3a.3. Does not show ""LTE+"" for Carrier Aggregation. Not a big deal, but it's nice to know.4. Works well most of the time, at least keeping up with the 3T. But would occasionally stutter, and would unload applications in the background more often than on the 3T (the 3T has 6GB of RAM)In fact, it feels VERY similar to the Xiaomi Mi A1, which has Android One. The Xiaomi is about 1.5 years old, and costs half the price, and they managed to include an extra 2x optical zoom lens for the rear camera. The main drawback of the Xiaomi is that it doesn't have most of the US LTE bands, so you're stuck with 3G mobile Internet most of the time.I was quite excited to get and use my OnePlus One, and later OnePlus 3T. This phone doesn't generate the same excitement. After using it for about 3 weeks, I find it to be an adequate phone but not amazing, except for its camera. I'd still use my DSLR for any serious photos, but it is good to know that I have a very capable picture taker in my pocket all the time.",2019年6月12日 在美国审核

"Once you go Pixel, you never go back","Google has definitely made an amazing device. this is my first pixel and I will continue to stick with the pixel family.

I don't understand the complaints that some people have, I have no issues with the battery life as it last 4 hours. I'm a very heavy user and a very heavy gamer and this particular device has no problem running any of the graphics intensive games that I play. It also has no problem running more than one app at a time.The pure version of Android 10 is amazing. I read about Google gestures and a lot of people did not like them and said that they weren't intuitive, however, I disagree. It takes a little bit to get used to but after that they're simple and very easy to use. At this point I would hate to go back using the bottom buttons or pill.This device has an amazing scream, he's not sluggish, starts very quickly and overall is an amazing device. Google is constantly updating the software which is next 19. The newest version of Android 10 is definitely a great addition to the Android operating system family.

At 400 dollars though, it's probably worth 6 stars!I'm upgrading from a pixel 1, which I still enjoyed, but I travel for work and the battery was depleting so quickly during the day that it became a forcing function.Screen - terrific. Battery - decent. Software - seamless and intuitive.Performance-snappy. Camera - magic.Superlative images.The fact that it is plastic isn't an issue whatsoever, given that I put all my phones in ruggedized cases.All in all, I don't feel I sacrificed anything meaningful.While this phone feels like an evolution - not a revolution- from my Pixel 1, it is so well conceived and functions so well, I have 0 complaints. Nicely done Google.Highly recommend.",2019年6月17日 在美国审核
Best phone I've had,"I loved my Samsung S10 but the AI assistant, camera and security chip and ability to use Google Fi is great. Has into of room, good features and battery life and display. 4 gigabytes of RAM is adequate and helps battery since I can't have 15 apps open and running at once.

"Has annoyances, but no actual problems","Everyone wants to know about the bad before theyit so I'll start with my complains.Finger Print reader works about 80% of the time, and it's in mind of an awkward place. I had a 2013 Moto X before switching to the Pixel 3a XL in December of 2019. Moving up to such a large phone in comparison, to stabilize the phone in my hand my finger often bumps into the finger print reader and can be a bit obnoxious in I'll unlock my phone when just picking it up to put it in my pocket and start accidently pocket-hitting apps on my screen. I got around this by being more careful about how I picked up the phone and just moved all my apps into the screen over from the home screen.The phone is large and can cramp my hand to hold for too long, even though I have very large hands and dextrous fingers (I play instruments).The touch-calibration feels significantly off sometimes especially when it comes to hitting the B key instead of the top of the spacebar. I'm also a big keyboard enthusiast and Google doesn't stagger the bottom row of keys on the touch screen so that's why it often happens, there's no staggered gap in that common spot to prevent mis-reads by the touch screen when you hit both keys at once or tap in the zone between them.The lack of decent cases is a little obnoxious but it's whatever, this isn't a very common phone so I can't genuinely complain without being petty.The camera focus is really obnoxious sometimes. The default flash also does multiple lights before the flash and is jarring because people don't often encounter that in 2020.--+But the good parts of this phone is everything else. Good UI, good battery life, good internals for the two games I do play on it, and a very good screen size for reading articles or websites. This is by no means a gaming phone. Also it's compatibility with the Google ecosystem is great and I love it. I personally disabled the Google Assistant, I don't need it to help me keep track of my life, that's what I have prescription drugs for.Lock button is in a good place, has a headphone jack despite I don't like wired headphones and despite people hated Apple for ditching the jack five years ago, it really doesn't do anything. It's just a port that collects lint for me but for anyone who likes wired headphones it's there.I love type-c charging and the Pixel is great because of that. Comes with a rapid charger, even though it degrades battery usage over time, I got this phone for $400, and in three years I'd imagine I can make another $400 to get the a new phone with a bigger battery anyways, so I'm honestly not worried about it. The fast charge now outweighs the thought of device longevity to me.",2020年2月1日 在美国审核
Updated Review- Easy to damage/Not a great camera,"Updated review- I have had 2 different types of protectors for this phone. The last being an Otterbox. Have had to replace the screen 2 times (170 a pop) and now a third possibility because the LCD is so easily damaged. Did not even drop the phone, but the LCD has now stopped working again. Had I known that just setting the phone down could damage the screen, I would have purchased another Samsung. Purchased this phone after reading about how great the camera is supposed to be. After taking the first couple pictures I realized this camera is not what it was touted to be. I purchased the Samsung 8 plus for my husband. His camera takes way better pictures especially when you need to zoom. Very very unimpressed especially at such a high price.",2020年2月12日 在美国审核
Updated review,"Updated update! The hotspot issue was with my carrier which makes a world of difference in what I think about the phone.The hype is the camera and I'm a photographer.The night sight is nothing special whatsoever. It does what it wants to and usually it's not what I'm wanting. But, the phone is good. Pretty fast and I won't curse it anymoreScrew this piece of crap phone.Good luck getting the hotspot to work which, by looking online, you will see is a problem for everyone.The phone is nearly useless to me without the hotspot.I always have bought phones in the $150-$200 range and now I know why.There is nothing special about this phone.They make you think the camera is awesome.I'm a photographer. The camera can do a couple things (photosphere, night shots) that others can't.Night shots are impossible to get as nice as they want you to believe.It did horrible on fireworks which was upsetting.You must have a tripod or something to keep phone completely still as well.The photosphere is fun...if it were possible to actually get one to turn out.In short, there is no reason to buy this over something half it's price.I'm writing after a month of use. Oh, good battery life and quick charge time. Still, the battery is internal, so they decide when it and your phone become deceased.UPDATED after another month.Still, yet to find anything to impress me.One huge problem though.Outside in 90 degree weather the phone will shut down because it gets hot.Never had a phone do this.Sucks!",2019年7月11日 在美国审核
I really love this phone!!!,This was my year for buying a new phone and my Pixel 2XL was starting to show wear. So when the reviews for the Pixel 4 came out and were less than stellar I decided to upgrade to the less expensive 3aXL and MAN am I glad I did. This is a terrific budget phone with premium performance. This phone has a SLOWER processor than my 2XL but I can't tell ANY decrease in performance AT ALL. It has simply been a great phone and I don't miss the few premium features that are missing at all. Buying the 3aXL is one of the best tech decisions for me this year.,2019年12月13日 在美国审核
Great camera and nice large screen,I bought this for my wife. We got it for $100 off. I didn't want to spend that much but it's worth it. She really loves the camera. I found she doesn't carry her Canon camera anymore! This phone may completely replace her Canon some day. The one thing the Canon has is 30x optical zoom which this phone doesn't have.She is becoming savvy with modifying photos too. She used to do that on the computer. The second thing she likes is the big screen. The compromise is a bigger phone to hold in her hand and keep in her pocket. She has to be careful it doesn't accidentally fall out of her pocket. She does have a case because the phone is slippery. Overall great phone for her.,2020年3月20日 在美国审核

Excellent phone at a great price!,"Love this phone! Finally an Android phone that works as smooth as an iPhone for half the price. It just does everything right. Subtle differences in the operating system and probably lots of tweeking by the Google engineers to make this phone the best I've ever owned. Only thing I'd like to have seen was an on-board memory slot. Also the smartlock doesn't have face recognition so trying to use it with the other settings allows the phone to ""wake up"" when you don't want it to.

Great innovations killed by mediocre hardware &amp; software bugs,"I've been an iPhone user since 2007. Iwas so excited Pixel is a solid alternative to iOS. I was raving about the phone for 6 months &amp; then the issues start.First I do commend Google for the innovations that are unique to Android - they are first to include an audio recorder that is able to fully transcribe &amp; index speech without the cloud.But there are too many annoying quirks and inconsistencies that drive me absolutely batty - like hitting the search bar at the bottom &amp; the OS not reliably showing you the last 5 apps - sometimes it doesn't list any apps until the 3rd or 4th try - it's super annoying &amp; inexcusable for something so basic &amp; frequently used.and don't get me started with the lags that started showing up after *six* months - are you serious?This phone hasnt even made it 2 years &amp; I'm ready to replace it (and not with another Pixel &amp; this breaks my heart as someone who considers himself agnostic &amp; pairs my phone w an iPadPro)I gave my dad my iPhone 8 &amp; it pains me to see a 4 year old phone I bought secondhand *still* runs just as smoothly as it did 2 years ago. shame on you Google!I'm not a fan of the fingerprint reader on the bottom (pain when the device is on the table or in the car) and it's not as reliable as I'd like it to be.I will say the camera takes great pictures &amp; I absolutely love the Google Photos integration - seamless and glad I still get free regular quality photo uploads.I'm also happy with the Google Voice integration even though you can't make GV texting the default app - kinda weird &amp; just worries me that Google is not ""all in"" on GV if they are not willing to improve and bake GV at the OS level.That said, it is awesome to not expose my SIM # when I make calls.If Google invested in a better quality hardware components - perhaps the 3a would have lasted 2 to 3 years like any average phone.The 3a does give hope &amp; I do tell iPhone users if they want to switch to look at a Pixel.If you are heavily vested in Googleservices: Chrome, Google Search, Google Workplace, Google Voice, Google Drive, Google Photos, Google Calendar, Google Mail, Google Contacts, Google Maps, Google Fit, etc - you will be happy w the integration - I do applaud my Pixel in how well it juggles 10 Google accounts and even supports multiple user logins (which unfortunately the 3a lacks enough RAM to do well)I'm likely to invest in a new iPhone 6-12 months from now &amp; it will be interesting to see how much I will miss a Pixel (I have no doubt this will be the case to be honest!)I bought this 3a at the same time as a Chromecast with Google TV and we're clear Google underpowers their hardware &amp; lets bugs through the cracks. I hope they step up their game - so much potential!",2021年10月20日 在美国审核
Not one problem,"The only downside was that it was hard to find good cases and screen protectors because we bought them so early. (My wife and I both got one.) That problem is likely solved by now.We had them delivered to us in Africa, and, even before we had phone numbers, this was our go-to camera for a trip through France, Switzerland, Norway, and across half us the US. When we arrived in France we got a SIM card with all the phone service and data we needed for a two week trip. It worked without a hiccup. Our pictures were amazing. We had fun messing around with the new camera features, great for a trip like that. Arriving in the US we got our permanent numbers, and we have used them for all of our internet connectivity and phone and texting since. Never once have the phones died, great battery life.

I feel like I got an incredible phone at an amazing price with barely any trade-offs.Really, the only trade-off in my mind is design. It's not the absolute sexiest piece of hardware around (the screen bezels are pretty big compared to most other recent generation flagship phones). But it's less than half the price of those phones, and that's literally the only downside. It probably performs better in almost every other way (especially the camera and the battery).

Sounded promising but has a few setbacks,"I took about a month or two to decide on buying this phone. I wanted a mid-range smartphone for my basic use, so I did my research to invest my money well. I was very much excited for the camera as I enjoy taking decent pictures for my own pleasure. The camera is splendid. A bit slow to capture the images, but the quality is great. I came to notice some of the downsides during the initial set up the phone though. Some sliding actions, like navigating from the home to where the apps are did not work until the 3rd or fourth try.I unfortunately broke the screen after a month of having it, so just opted for an iPhone because they generally last longer. I cannot wait to return to Android though. Also watch out for your device getting registered to your phone number when changing devices.

My biggest gripe is that I didn’t pay attention and I thought this phone came with ability to add a memory card for addition storage. I guess I looked at too many and confused the Pixel with other phones. I would probably buy again, especially at the current price. I bought a few months early but had no choice.

Fortunately, the contents was intact.Shipping took two more days than expected because UPS sucks and refused to make a second delivery attempt.As for the Pixel itself, it is a great phone. I love the fact that it will have the latest android every time and it has a headphone jack! The plastic back doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Besides, 99% of people use a case anyway. Having a glass or aluminumback is pointless.Overall great phone, this is no nexus but it's up there.",2019年6月17日 在美国审核

However, right side of display is noticeably dimmer / not as bright as the left, especially noticable when screen backlight is turned down, sometimes making it hard to see or read things on right side.

This unlocked Pixel 3a is an ideal choice for GrapheneOS.,"I specifically bought this device for use with GrapheneOS, a privacy and security oriented fork of the Android Open Source Project.It works like a dream on this device, and I'm thrilled with it.The Pixel 3a (like all Pixels) gets three years of security patch support, which doesn't seem like much, but it's better than most smartphones (many of which don't even get a version upgrade, ever).I'm still a little grumpy about the lack of physical keyboards being available on new, high quality smartphones.I had to make my own rear camera cover because apparently only front cameras are served by generally available, useful covers.Pixels don't support SD cards of any kind.The fact three years is considered a long time for security patch support of a new device is unconscionable, but somehow people just accept it.The stock OS (like on all major manufacturers' devices) is a nightmare of privacy violations.Everything but the SD card issue is common to contemporary smartphones; the last of them (the OS and its giant pile of invasive stock applications that can't be removed) is very easily fixed with an unlocked Pixel 3a like mine.",2020年3月11日 在美国审核

"Don’t get ripped off on other phones, get the Pixel 3a!","Let me start off my review by putting it in proper context.I use the phone to make calls/texts, take family pictures, browse the internet, use about ten apps regularly, and of course write Amazon reviews.I’m not too interested in fancy features and I prefer function and value over having the latest and greatest, which is why I waited over a year to purchase this phone after it was released.I purchased this phone after extensive research, mostly based on favorable reviews and the price.I am well aware there is a reason this phone is less expensive than the Google Pixel 3 or Pixel 4.I also didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I wanted an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network.Verizon was pushing the Google Pixel 4 and other expensive phones and didn’t even offer the 3a models.The price is right on Amazon for this phone at $378, which would break down to $15.75 per month if it was under one of those Verizon financing plans for 24 months.Most of their phones are going for $30-$45 per month to finance so this is a bargain.The Good:Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up.The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue.The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly.The Pixel 3a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7.It used a USB cable to connect and download everything.Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost.Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate.The camera is outstanding and surpasses my iPhone 7 Plus, except for the fact it doesn’t offer the panoramic photo option which I’ve come to appreciate on the iPhones.Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features.This battery lasts all day long even with regular use, which is something I wasn’t used to on the Samsung Galaxy or iPhone even when they were new phones.It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge took less than 90 minutes.The Bad:The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context.There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features.Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water.Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.The most impactful thing that I experienced was this Pixel takes a different charger cable than I was accustomed to.We have a ton of micro USB cables in the house for older Android and Kindle devices, along with Apple charging cables.This phone takes a USB-C cable.It comes with a charger and battery life is excellent so this isn’t a huge issue either.Summary:This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users.It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones.It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life.Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 3a so I am giving this a strong four stars.",2020年7月25日 在美国审核
Almost the perfect camera (for me) but let down by lousy screen,"I've given this phone a good many weeks before I gave my impressions. In most respects I find it speedy and the UI nice and fluid and well designed. Since android 10 it's even better. The finger print sensor is fast. The always on screen I find extremely useful. It's the best phone I've ever owned in fact, and I've had many.Here's the thing. One of the reasons for buying the 3A was the OLED screen. Made by Samsung. I wanted those inky blacks. And, this phone delivers that, but, the greys are very 'streaky'. That is when displaying a grey screen (which is often after Android 10 and black mode) there is a distinct dark vertical area to the right of the screen. It's very obvious, not just on low screen brightness. It's always been there, but in my early use of the phone I thought its was just an intentional gradient.It's not. The blacks are inky black, but the grays, even at high brightness, streak for about 1/4 of the right hand screen. It's VERY noticeable at low brightness.So, excellent phone in all other respects. Camera is brilliant. Speedy updates are great. Fast, slick. Solid bit of kit.But that screen is driving me absolutely nuts.If I could return it I would (and then buy another one. It's that good)",2019年9月26日 在美国审核

Exceptional phone.,"Phone is responsive not on flagship level but plenty good enough for all but the most egregious of smartphone users.Camera is great with night signt standing on it's own as one of the most impressive displays of computational photography I have ever seen. My phone will take photos in lighting condition that my Canon T5 has no chance at all of resolving. Maybe leaving the T5's shutter open for a vast amount of time but impractical for most photography applications. The screen is nice and sharp with nice color and enough brightness for easy outdoor use as you would expect, and it goes low enough to use in the dark without being blinding. The speakers are exceptable not great, though is prefer both being front facing. Headphone jack including, thumbs up for that. Charging is quick and battery life for my uses get me though the day easily most days. Body of the phone is plastic and well made. I subscribe to the making a phone out of class being stupid camp and am happy this phone is my made from a more reasonable material. An added bonus being the phone is very lite so with a case on it it's less noticable in your pocket. This is a great device, and is everything the vast majority of people want and need in a smartphone for a great price. Lastly the phone will be supported and say up to date keeping your personal data more secure than other less diligent vendors. This phone might have a harder time with competition in other markes with the like or the one plus 7 and the like, but here in the US it's one of the best value propositions out there.",2019年9月25日 在美国审核

Happy with the build quality and the built in camera app,"This phone seems to be of very high quality. The built in camera app is very highly rated and does a great job in very low, night light and in portrait mode where it tries to blur the background. The images are sharp and crisp and well saturated in color.<br>Be aware, however that if you are a photographer, you will likely be disappointed in the portrait mode software algorithm, especially if you use Photoshop to manipulate your photos. Overall, it does a good job of masking out the subject and blurring the background, but it will get confused with ""fly-away"" hair against a ""busy"" background. This will show up as a very bad mask with bad digital artifacts around the hair. This is especially a problem if the person's hair is brown for example, and the background directly behind them (and their hair) has brown or brown sections in it. Still better than not having this portrait algorithm but just realize that it's doing this background blurring in software, not by using multiple lenses on the camera. This phone has only one lens.The nice thing though (thank goodness) is that if you take a picture in Portrait mode, the camera will actually take two pictures--the original and the version with the algorithm to blur the background. You can then decide later which you want to keep or if you want to use the original version and manipulate it in Photoshop yourself.Lastly, it supports the industry standard DNG Raw image files so you can manipulate them later with software. I wish is supported Canon's CR2 but it does not. Perhaps that's proprietary to Canon. I had no difficulty manipulating the DNG Raw files in Photoshop though.</br>",2020年3月19日 在美国审核

"Great Value for Money, Always Room to Improve","I bought this phone on Black Friday for $299 and so far I think it has been worth it. I was upgrading my two year old Motorola Z2 Play, so any comparisons are to that phone.Screen - The screen quality is excellent in my mind and the brightness is very goodCamera - Like most other reviewers, I agree the camera on this phone is absolutely wonderful. I'm currently in the process of re-taking a bunch of scenic pictures around Colorado that I've taken on previous phones because this one is so much better.Fingerprint Sensor - I do not like that it is on the back, as I often set my phone down on my desk and use it while working or otherwise playing on my computer. However, the speed and accuracy of the fingerprint sensor is noticeably better than my Z2 Play.Battery Life - While certainly in the ""good"" category, my Z2 Play was better in this area. I'm usually somewhere between 40-60% at the end of a typical day, my Z2 was closer to 60-70% most days.Call Quality - The call quality has been great. I was able to connect the unlocked phone to Verizon's Wifi calling with no issue.Headphone Jack - While this does have a headphone jack, it is on the top. After having it on the bottom on my last phone and the top before that, I prefer it on the bottom.Software - The performance is generally good for everything I've done on it. I'm not a gamer.Physical Form - This phone does feel nice in your hand, I do have a small case on it. It's just about the right size if you're mainly a one hand phone user. If you like to use two hands, it might be a tad small and you may want the XL version.Issues I've had (why I removed a star)1. The phone has restarted a few times without warning. I haven't ever actually noticed it, but it's come out of my pocket like it's starting up fresh 3 or so times in 6 weeks I've had it.2. I have trouble sending texts on some wifi networks (at my gym, for example). As soon as I disconnect form wifi, it works fine. I do not think this is a carrier/network issue because my old phone, using the same standard google messages app, did not have this problem. Hopefully the newly deployed RCS will make this a non-issue.For the record, my carrier is Verizon.",2020年1月3日 在美国审核

"I have to admit, I'm impressed","I buy a LOT of smartphones. Too many. It's a real problem. I usually just buy the flagships. I want the best features and the maximum amount of power. I wanted the Pixel experience, though, and this phone was on sale, so I picked it up. I have to say, I'm impressed. You do not get what you pay for. You get much more. This phone punches well above it's weight. Let's break it down:Screen: I generally prefer a larger display. With the notch, the Pixel 3 XL is roughly the same size, so you're really not losing much here at 6"" even. The display is beautiful and the 1080p resolution is not an issue.Battery: The phone really shines here. It easily lasted me to the end of the day, even with heavy use. This is partially due to the ""mid-range"" processor the phone is using. More on that later. Suffice it to say, this is the battery life the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL SHOULD have had.Performance: This is where you'd expect it to take a hit. I'm here to tell you that it doesn't. It's every bit as smooth as the Pixel 3 XL (I used them side-by-side). It's actually a little unnerving how well it performs. Where you WILL see a slight hit is in anything involving storage. Loading apps, copying files, etc. It has slower storage than the flagships and that's the one place you will see it show, but the day-to-day performance is pretty bullet-proof. The only other place it suffers is RAM. No Pixel ever should have had 4GB of RAM. But I can say with confidence that it does the best it can with that limitation.Camera: I mean, it's a Pixel. The photos are every bit as good as the Pixel 3. The only place you will see a degradation is in processing time. The slower processor and storage mean that the HDR+ shots take a little longer to process in the background. You can keep using the camera, but if you tap on the picture you just took, it will be a few seconds before you can really look at it.Everything else is pretty solid. Haptics are good. Speakers are great. You're missing wireless charging and water resistance, if those are important to you. If they're not, and you can live with a very marginally slower phone, I would definitely recommend this over the Pixel 3 XL, if only for the battery life.",2020年1月17日 在美国审核

Newer version 4A is now out so I'm quite surprised 3A are still sold above $300 when 4A is $349. In my experience (and I have/had few older Pixel phones before)after 2-3 years you get battery issues and I got one phone ruined when took it to theshop to replace its battery.

UPDATE:  JUNK,"Not a fan of Apple...don't like how every other device uses USB-B except Apple, can't change default apps, then they came out w/ an update that made non-apple chargers not work...just seems like a sleazy company to me.Loved my Galaxy S3, wasn't impressed w/ S5, upgraded to S7 a couple years later and pretty much hated it (slow, glitchy) and decided I was done w/ Samsung, if possible (Galaxy's and iPhones are the most popular so I figured maybe I was SOL).Did a lot of research via Cnet, Google reviews, Amazon reviews and determined the Pixel 3a seemed like it was just as good if not better than S10+ and for $500ish less.I really like Google Home and figured a Google phone would have to work extremely well with Android.Figured I'd give it a shot.<br>Verdict:ILOVED MY PIXEL 3a!!!It starts up super quick, not slow or glitchy, I love the fingerprint reader on the upper back of the phone (where you naturally hold it), very well-designed &amp; user friendly system, doesn't come loaded w/ a bunch of garbage apps you can't get rid of, you can squeeze the sides of the phone to open up google assistant, you can tilt the phone left and right to switch from front camera to back camera, the camera has so many features and the night sight is cool,charges fast, batter lasts forever and I'm a heavy user.So glad I made the switch.Update:within less than year charging port failed.Since under warranty google took care of it.I remember the warranty experience being good but still concerning I had to use the warranty, usually electronic last well past their warranty.Around a year after getting the phone replaced the first time - the phone is now pretty glitchy, the battery life is terrible, and now the rear facing camera doesn't work.Confirmed w/ google it's a hardware issue and no longer under warranty.My only options are $100ish for a repair (go to a store 2 hours away or mail-in and go w/out device for 7-10 days) or trade the pixel for ($15-30 dollars) lol and get a new device starting at 349.I get Pixel's cost significantly less but they should last longer than a year.So my search for a cell phone worth having continues.</br>",2019年8月15日 在美国审核

Only thing I can say negative is you can not insert a SD card for extra memory. But I can live with that. Hope I don't break it! :),2020年8月26日 在美国审核
Great Phone but No Native Screen Recording,"I got this last December and so far am loving just about everything about it. A few issues I have come across are that Google has disabled the native android screen recording feature, so you'll need an additional app if you want to do that. Also, the hands-free mode is easily activated from the side power button (and, by easy I mean, I picked up my phone at work to order lunch and it continued to wig out and shout back to me every letter and every action on the screen for twenty minutes while I tried to figure out the right sort of exorcism needed to fix it). I'm sure it's super useful when driving but, I've been scarred now and haven't deliberately activated it.Heavy app users may want more memory but, I've managed to fit quite a lot on it and everything runs smoothly. Camera is good. Screen quality is good. Sound quality is good. Call screening is fantastic. Lots of notifications at first but, they can be disabled from the notification screen as well as settings. I'm very happy with the phone.",2020年5月26日 在美国审核
Don't drop this phone,Decent phone. But I'm not. A phone snob Need something to call &amp; take pictures. No games or movies or kid stuff Purely a work phone. It's delicate as it fell two feet - cracked screen. Still working. I'll replace it if price drops on new screen.,2019年9月27日 在美国审核

Unresponsive touchscreen.,I got two Pixel 3a XLs and the touchscreen stopped working for no reason at all. I got a replacement within a couple of days and within a couple of weeks the replacement had the exact same problem. Unresponsive touchscreen even after I followed all their advice. I had to spend a whole week without a cell phone working as a COVID responder thanks to the unreliability of this phone and Google's customer service. Unfortunately Google does not stand by their products any more and I will never buy another Pixel again.,2020年6月12日 在美国审核
Not reliable people to buy from,This is about the people selling the phone not the phone itself. I ordered the phone that was supposed to be unlocked but it's still locked with Verizon and now I've been trying for three days to get Verizon to unlock it but the hold times on the phone are long and I have to get transfered between different departments.

It's a great phone,"I bought this with the intention of replacing an older model android (samsung galaxy s3). So compared to that, this is much faster and picture quality and options are amazing. I originally didn't want the XL version, but I got used to the bigger size in my hand. If you're also worried about that, don't be. The XL is also better for viewing games and playing youtube videos or streaming tv services, which I recommend. This phone is fast, organized, and recognizes all sorts of voice commands, which I've never had or taken advantage of before. This phone is awesome, be sure to get a case and screen protector or liquid glass applied to it. For the price, it is a stellar purchase. I got mine on black friday, so it was 379.99. a good price for the XL at the time.",2020年1月3日 在美国审核

It's ok,I love the camera. Way better then some of the other phones I've had. My apps load faster. I can actually play my Disney Kingdoms without a lag. I don't like how there's no tab on the bottom right of phone to clear the pages on your phone. Not used to it being there when you pull up the menu with all your apps. Battery life is eh. Your battery does drain quick. I have went through three different phones in the last 6 months and have done the same things with all phones and this is the fastest draining one. We bought two and both do the same thing. So I don't know what we're doing wrong. Or if we're doing something wrong. And yes we do use battery saver. I haven't ventured too much with the phone. But these are the only things I've noticed so far. Also I have never paid more then $200 on a phone. Guess I was expecting more. Obviously not like what those really expensive phones would do but was hoping I would like it a lot. But it's ok. Again I do like the camera. It's better then any other I have had. So that's a plus,2020年5月1日 在美国审核
Nice phone for the price with a horrendous flaw,"I am into budget smart phones. I refuse to spend more than 300$ on a phone that I expect to get 2 or ideally 3 years out of.In comparison the the Honor 7X I had for the last two years, the most pleasing thing about this phone is the fact it can still use the most up to date OS, the features of which I greatly enjoy.It charges much faster due to its USB C port. That is a major bonus over the 7X and some other budget smartphones. Coupled with the more robust design of the USB C I dont see this port failing like my 7X did after 2 years of heavy use and abuse.Phone is fast enough, although I do see some lag opening apps and some tap lag.Camera is great and this is a great phone for the money, at least features wise you will be hard pressed to beat it.However, my experience has with this phone has been tainted by one serious flaw. I CONSTANTLY mute this phone with my face, and it is infuriating.The mute button, even with the call minimized is in a highly unfortunate spot.There is supposed to be a sensor that detects your face and stops this. It doesnt work for whatever reason. So I have to get in the habit of turning of the screen on my phone every time I talk, or without fail I will mute myself.Upon browsing forums related to this phone, I see its a common problem and not just my prominent cheek bones.This is a quality phone, honestly someone would be hard pressed to tell this phone apart from flagship models on most applications given a blind test, however the muting problem I discussed would make me reconsider buying this one.",2020年2月19日 在美国审核
This is not the phone you want,"After about a month with this phone I decided it's too much trouble to keep. But I'll start with the pros. The battery life is pretty good, I forgot to charge it one night and it didn't die until 6 pm the next day. The camera is great of course. That's about it. My phone had a serious overheating problem, and considering the fact that I only usually have 3-4 apps open (chrome, messanger, sms, camera) and am always inside, it was an aggravating feature to deal with. Whenever it over heated, it would immediately end whatever call/video call I was in the middle of, and wouldn't let me make a call back on the phone or on messanger (""Call failed""). Whenever you have to get used to saying ""Sorry, my phone..."" you've got a problem. Another annoying thing was watching videos...I would turn the screen for full screen, and the video would only cover half of the phone screen. I would download photos and not be able to find them in the photo files. I'd markup photos and not be able to find the marked up versions (they weren't in any albums). Just several tiny things that kept piling on until I decided I wanted something better.",2019年10月12日 在美国审核

"Great phone, great camera, decent battery. EDIT: Unless something goes wrong.","I upgraded from a cheaper phone (J3 Prime), which was just... awful. I had used the Pixel, and Pixel XL as well as the Pixel 3 prior to this. I loved all of them. I was hesitant because this phone was so much less expensive than the Pixel 3, so I figured it must have serious drawbacks. I'm pleasantly surprised.Pros:- Awesome camera. Really, truly awesome. It's fast, clear, and takes photos with good color fidelity. I'm not a pro photographer, so keep that in mind. For your average person whojust wants to take photos of some stuff sometimes, and have pretty good detail: It's perfect.- Powerful processor, and great system resources all around. With my previous phone I'd notice a major slowdown if I had more than one app open, and it just made life miserable. I showed my sister that it took about 1.5 minutes to open maps, and put in her address, then hit navigate. First thing I did after I got this Pixel 3a set up was open every single app, and sign in, then hit home, close the screen and perform the same test. With 25 apps all open and signed in I was able to open Maps, select my sister's address, and hit navigate (and turn on the GPS, because it was off) in about 10 seconds. System showed NO signs of slowdown when I had 25 apps open, and was searching around on the internet.- Good screen. I like the resolution, because I don't notice the individual pixels when looking at the phone, so that's a huge step up for me. It's capable of displaying high definition (1080), and has a decent refresh rate so nothing seems particularly jittery to me. Display gets bright enough that I have no trouble with it when outside in broad daylight, and gets dim enough that I don't have to worry about checking emails at night in bed and disturbing the other person in the bed.- Lots of features. I like the fingerprint reader, even though it's probably considered a vulnerability by the most tinfoil-hat-wearing security folks. It makes life so much easier. The squeeze function to access your assistant is pretty neat, too. I mean... You can always just say ""OK Google"" and access it, but it's nice to have options.- Standard headphone jack. I'm oldschool, so I use an old 3.5mm jack (I think that's the right size. Don't hate me if I'm wrong!) for listening to music, as my truck doesn't have bluetooth.- Battery Life is decent. Lots of folks are complaining about the battery draining super fast. I don't get it. If you're permanently attached to your phone, sure. It'll probably run out somewhat quickly. I get about 2 days charge on it if I'm using it a lot. 3 days if I'm not. I let it get down to about 20% then charge it. With the included charger it takes about 30 minutes to go from 20-80%, so... I'm good with that.Cons:- The phone feels like they cut cost on the case materials (they probably did, and I'm ok with that!). First phone where I actually decided to buy a case for protection.- That's it. Really. I haven't had any issues with this phone whatsoever. It's about double what my previous phone cost, but it's 100% worth it.Other thoughts:- Perfect phone for someone who needs to use their phone for more than just placing and receiving phone calls, and text messages, and cares about how long it takes. If you're into super premium phones with every single bell, whistle, and feature/function under the sun... This phone's not for you. If you're a person who uses a phone to look stuff up on the internet, and maybe use some apps... You're gonna have a great experience.- If you bought a bottom level phone because you're cheap (like me) and regret the decision, but REALLY don't want to overspend because now you're buying TWO phones (your cheap phone, and the one to replace it)... Buy this one. You won't regret it.EDIT: After only owning the phone for a short while, I noticed the phone was having issues with charging. It would take a while to acknowledge it was charging, and would sometimes start and stop. No longer getting fast charge.

"Sprint phone, not fully unlocked, does not work on Verizon network.","I bought a Pixel 3a unlocked, hoping to use it on the Verizon network. I spent more than 3 hours working with a Verizon representative in person in the store. It turns out the device was originally set up to work on the Sprint network. Although it appears to be unlocked at first, it is not really the case. Its firmware is locked down by Sprint and is not a fit on the Verizon network. The network settings are showing a default Sprint entry. Of note, it does recognize a new SIM card from Verizon after fumbling with the network settings. Unfortunately it does not set itself up automatically as the Verizon representative said that it should. It is able to connect to the Verizon network for a few seconds, then loose its settings entirely. I ultimately had to return it. I have to give it only one star as the description is misleading, and I lost a lot of time on this.",2019年11月11日 在美国审核

A great phone with minor inconveniences,"Having lost my Samsung Galaxy S7, I decided to get the Pixel to see what it's about. And overall, the phone operates really well. Switching over from Samsung, the UI is similar with a minor drawback in that the home pages are not customizable; you will have to scroll to the right to get to the other pages while in Samsung you can rearrange them.One MAJOR drawback that I've seen since an update occurred, is that the base alarm clock no longer works. The clock app works fine but the alarm function is no longer works; as in, when the set time comes, the phone remains silent and the alarm simply switches off. Not cool.Another thing I miss since moving over from Galaxy is that the Google Photos app does seem to be somewhat lacking in the functionality department. The base Photos app in Samsung allows you to modify and create GIFs with your existing photos or videos, Google Photos does not. A slight disappointment but not altogether damning.Everything else works as you expect. If nothing else, Google wasn't lying about its camera. Whoo, does it take wonderful pictures!",2019年12月3日 在美国审核

"Robust , neat and stylish","First of all to answer any concerns about this , the camera is great! Very high quality photos and pictures taken at night seems to be taken by a professional camera man in a studio . What is not good about the camera : Does not support manual mode .Mobile is fast can handle many tasks processor is great RAM is also working fine , it heats up a little (to a warm degree similar to holding a coffee cup using a collar ) after 3+ hours of continuous use but i am not judging this as a bad side .The package of the mobile itself is regular nothing too fancy it does contain however a groovy Google logo sticker (I didn't place it on the mobile though . The back side of the mobile feels so good to hold that i kinda miss it due to the protective case i am using .Selfie cam is awesome if i haven't mentioned that yet .The small things I don't like are basically some software issues that will hopefully be solved in the near future , for example most android mobiles has the ability to flip the phone while receiving a call to mute the ring tone ; that is missing ! .My old Asus phone had a cool feature which is the tap tap (knock knock as i liked to call) which is double tap on the screen unlocks the mobile or prompts you with the pattern . In the pixel 3aone must either press the lock button or use the finger print sensor which is very efficient and have worked perfectly even if my finger was not exactly clean or a little bit wet .The phone however asks for patter reconfirmation a lot I don't know why ?Another thing would be if you are an individual concerned about your privacy this phone will protect your privacy from any app you want but google apps , using the google assistant to ask for directions to the airport would work fine but when you click on the map it came up with for the fastest route the phone will ask you for location servicepermission , the phone consumes background data and uses any service in the mobile for google's favor without any permission what so ever but for other apps they are pretty careful about what YOU share .Definitely a good deal for the price and you are having a phone that looks like a high end product although it is a middle class phone and it also has a middle class price which shocks people about the great bargain you have ! ;)",2019年9月23日 在美国审核

I'm not a heavy phone user -- I don't watch videos on my phone except very occasionally (once or twice a week) and almost always when I'm at home or on WiFi. So you can imagine how strange I find it that before lunch this phone typically has only about 85% battery left, when I've maybe spent a grant total of 10-15 minutes using the screen.I'm hoping a future software update will help with power management, but otherwise I do like the phone.

Why people want to walk around with great slabs of television in their pockets instead of the neat little phones of yore is a mystery to me, but I hope someone makes a sensible, hand-sized, pocket-sized, modern-spec smartphone soon. Watch television at home and look out of the window when you're on the bus for god's sake, you don't need a great stinking brick of a thing filling up your pockets and your mind just so that you don't have to wait ten minutes to find out how many people like your inane comments about a breakfast cereal you remember from ten years ago.",2020年6月2日 在美国审核

Nice but some issues,"Nice phone with a few issues within a week of use.. the speaker on top the phone sounds like it has blown so I get a popping noise when turning up the volume all the way. Also it heats up easily and glitches when trying to use 2 apps (or rather one app and the phone). HOWEVER, the camera is phenomenal! The screen is clear and beautiful in color when watching Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus.

"Update, not getting it done on firstnet","I just received this phone yesterday. Will update the review if needed. First, shipping was a week ahead of schedule, that's always a plus. Set up was easy. I use Firstnet as my wireless provider by AT&amp;T. I googled comparability and couldn't find a straight answer, well it works for those of you in the same boat. I am switching from a Galaxy S9. I didn't want to spend $900 on a new phone. This one so far meets my needs at a great value. Look forward to putting it through its paces over the weekend as I learn how the pixel operating system works (my first pixel). This model is promised software updates until May 2022 like the pixel 4 and is about $200-300 less expensive. So far very happy.UPDATE11/3/2020So the phone had to be replaced. The one itself meets 90% of my expectations. However I only received about 30-50% of any incoming calls on this phone. I constantly got texts from people saying they had called me 5+ times when I had never received a call. I couldn't check my voicemail and I was unable to call the non emergency number for the local dispatch. No explanation it just always said the number you dialed cannot be called as dialed or something to that effect. I went back and forth with tech support which was super helpful for almost a month and finally they determined it to be a device issue. I just stuck it out because I didn't want to start over with a new phone. I did a factory reset and everything. And after missing several important calls I finally went to my local AT&amp;T store and got another device. No more phones from Amazon for me. Again, I loved the phones features and camera quality but not a good fit for this firstnet user.",2020年7月3日 在美国审核

I kept reading about how great this phone is and I was ready for something a little smaller than the XL.Compared to my first Pixel XL and then the Pixel 2 XL, this phone is slow and buggy. It drives me nuts half the time when it doesn't respond to touch or has a delay in everything. On occasion it will lock up and all I can do is restart it. Sometimes when clicking on a text box like this, I have to wait 10 seconds just for the keyboard to come up.It's a frustrating experience overall.I have previously tried the Pixel 4 and didn't think it was worth the upgrade cost so I returned it.

Google could have made this phone much better,"I’m of the opinion that newer phones should be better, so I’m disappointed in how the Pixel 3a compares to my old phone.I had a Nexus 5 phone for several years that worked great until it started having the strange malfunctions that smartphones have when they get old.Setup of the Nexus 5 was easy and fast.Setup of the Pixel 3a took hours and hours because it required connecting the phones with a cable to transfer apps and data that transferred things very slowly.Extreme call blocker was working great on my Nexus 5.It did not transfer to Pixel 3a, and it is no longer on Google Play.I hate losing that great app.I have three other complaints about the Pixel 3a, and the first one is the biggest.1) It would not let me access text messaging until I agreed to allow Google to send occasional texts to or from the phone for number verification.The Google support website provides instructions for changing this that don’t work.There is no place in settings to change how Google verifies the number.I pay for each text, and I really do not like what is supposed to be my phone being hijacked by Google.2) The screen comes on whenever I pick up the phone.I should have to press the button to bring the phone out of standby.I don’t like the phone coming alive whenever it’s picked up.3) The volume is pathetic.Even set on maximum and on speaker phone, speaker volume is weak, noticeably less than what it was on the Nexus 5.",2020年3月11日 在美国审核

Still learning,I have never purchased a phone online before. You do not have the actual help of setting it up nor help in using it properly. There are a few things I have no clue on how to fix or change. The camera is not what they were raving about. I hope maybe a settings change will help. The only reason I bought a Pixel phone was because the guys from Best Buy had them and told me they were the best while setting up my new internet equipment. Modem and router.

But Amazon shipped using their own delivery service, and although the driver came within a block of my home, the phone was not delivered, with no explanation. I ended up cancelling the order the next day and going to Best Buy, which had the same phone for the same price.

Counting down the days until it's unusable,"This phone started out great. It was fast and did everything it was supposed to do. One day, I was listening to something through the speaker on the phone and it started to crackle. I thought I'd blown out the speaker at first. Additionally, when I answered the phone it took 3 solid seconds for anyone to be able to hear me and even when it kicked in they would tell me it sounded like I was far away from the phone. I didn't have that a issue when on Bluetooth.Looked it up on Google and it seemed like this was a decently common issue with this phone and it was a software issue. To resolve it, it said to remove the last downloaded apps. I did that but what ended up working was to delete all of the saved data from the apps. Suddenly, my phone calls worked better and my speaker works for listening to music/ audio books just fine. Still doesn't work for phone calls on speaker. Clearly, this is not an issue with the hardware. Now I've lost all the settings for my apps which is quite frustrating.Of course, all of this happened literally one week out of the return window. Now it seems to be having trouble charging as of this week. Nothing has ever physically happened to this phone to cause this. I really am just waiting for this phone to kick the bucket and I only bought it 2 months ago. I would attempt a return, but then I'd be without a phone.

This phone sucks. It's terrible and whoever designed it should feel bad.Yaaay good camera. Who cares.",2020年4月29日 在美国审核

Okay but horrible battery life,"First the good; for the price this phone has decent performance and an excellent camera. App response is snappy, and the OLED has very nice blacks. There’s very little to complain about when simply examining general performance.However, battery life is abysmal, to the point I think I received a defective unit. Leaving the phone on standby hemorrhages almost 2% an hour. That may not sound like much, but after a whole day of zero use, the phone has lost 30-40% of battery life. Coming from a Moto 5g plus with the exact same apps, this is pretty bad (the moto lost about 10% a day on standby). Gsam Battery Monitor shows this issue is due to Android System and Android Kernel being active while the phone is ""asleep""; is may be an android 10 compatibility issue.I don't think I'll be buying another Google phone, particularly as all the frequent charging this one requires will leave the battery dead before long. Be lucking to get a year out of it at this rate.",2020年1月20日 在美国审核

Issues GALORE with the Pixel 3a smartphone,"I purchased the Pixel 3a roughly 3 months and amount other issues the phone does not ring for incoming calls, I do not receive notification for incoming texts,....... to name a few.I contact Pixel/Google support and their response was ""the issues that you are explaining are known to us and our engineers are working on the fix. Please wait for the next update of the Android update. Thanks for your patience. Regards, The Google Support Team"".EXCUSE ME, my patience has run out!They should not have released the phone and/or the Android update(s) that created these issues leaving me with a defective and basically unusable phone.The reason that I purchased a Pixel phone was that I thought that Google controlling the software, Android AND the hardware, Pixel the chance of ""a problem"" would be limited and am VERY DISAPPOINTED that they have been so cavalier in providing a fix or replacing the Pixel 3a with a phone that WORKS!

Hardware Issues... Typical Google Pixel,"This phone is very fast and clean with an excellent camera. I wanted to like it, but I started having issues with video recordings and phone calls where there is a high pitch noise in the background after only a few months of use. I have had similar hardware issues before with an amazon-purchased 1st gen google pixel. Unfortunately, I am past the amazon 30 day return and despite being within the google warranty, my only options are to drive 50 miles to their official repair store or mail in my phone for 10 days while they assess and send a new one. I am a big android guy but it is getting pretty hard when no android company can make a quality piece of equipment. There is no reason a cell phone can't last a few years until its hardware becomes obsolete, but my last three phones ave failed to do so. Very disappointing.",2020年1月16日 在美国审核
There are better phones our there. Be careful of the misleading reviews.,"I purchased this phone and was really excited about it based on the reviews and the price. When I received it, the disappointment began. The phone is smaller than depicted and the quality of the build is poor. The camera, which is the large selling point of the phone, isn't anything special. While charging for about 5 mins, for its first charge, my phone began to over heat well beyond normal. (It was as if I left my phone on the hot concrete in the middle of a 110 degree Texas day.) Needless to say, I returned the phone. For the price, there are better phones out there by many other manufacturers. I loved Google products in the past but will probably not buy one in the future.As for the 3000+ reviews, giving a great overall rating for the phone. I believe that Amazon is giving 3rd party sellers and itself the ability to compound multiple product reviews for different products in a single location, giving the appearance to buyers that the product is much better than what you receive. I had this happen a few times on separate products so, buyer beware.Hopefully this helps some of you out there. Stay safe and healthy.",2020年4月30日 在美国审核

Was great until forcing Android 11 for security patches,"UPDATE: Android 12 is now a forced update to continue receiving security patches. WOW, and I thought Android 11 was buggy: 12 takes it to a whole new level!! At this point, Android can no longer even correctly sum my daily step count—a simple array of INTEGERS!! And now my phone also looks like it was designed for elderly persons who need GIANT system fonts and have no understanding of iconography!I TRULY wish I'd never purchased my Pixel 3a and regret that decision EVERY day since the Android 11 update was forced upon users who value security updates.______________________________________________Was a nearly-ideal phone on Android 10.Then Google forced Android 11 onto Pixel 3a in order to continue to receive the promised security patches.I could list all of the new bugs introduced in 11, but most won't even read all of them, and the list is so extensive as to be almost unbelievable.To make matters worse, Android support is ABYSMAL. Despite having numerous, varied, and nuanced issues (including issues with the ADB CLI), agents simply take me through the four ""magic steps"" on every call: 1.) restart device, 2.) clear Play Store cache, 3.) factory reset device, and finally they 4.) ""escalate the issue"" into the void. Their phone system constantly hangs up on me; Whether by glitch or agent action, I cannot say. Supervisors are NEVER available, and when callbacks are promised they never materialize. I have received literally ZERO practical assistance with this or my previous Google hardware despite clear promises otherwise. Unless the problem is ""I forgot my password"" or ""my WiFi won't connect"", Google support is ill-equipped to deal with it.Basically, went from a 5-star to a 2-star device just by tapping ""update"".",2020年12月31日 在美国审核

"Good, But Defective","This is my second Pixel 3a. Having purchased one previously as an Amazon Renewed item I used it for approximately 6 months until the loudspeaker on the phone failed. The phone prior to that was awesome, I loved everything about it. I returned it to Amazon and thinking maybe it was an issue because of the refurbished phone I opted to replace it with a brand new Pixel 3a. Once again, loved the phone. It had everything I wanted out of a phone. Minimal ""premium"" materials to drive up the cost, a nice screen, great battery life, and a no-frills Android experience. However within one month of ownership of my brand new phone the same exact issue occurred. The loud speaker failed. Searching online shows this to be a common problem with these phones with google support pages being filled with hundreds of replies for the same issue.Google's tech support was no good, they wanted me to send my phone in for repairs; leaving me with no phone for 7 to 10 days (or I could drive 100+ miles to repair the phone in a shop, maybe, if they could). So I opted to return the phone and go with a different manufacturer. Which is really a shame, as I was truly in love with the 3a.

Don't waste your money on this phone.,"Unless you want a flat camera that's otherwise mostly useless don't buy this phone. I bought this phone because of the camera but apparently you can't have a good phone and a good camera in one. The messaging system is absolute garbage, you may or may not get the messages people send you unless you use a different messaging app than the one that's pre-installed. Your phone may ring when you get a call or you might get a message tone if you get lucky enough to have a message come through but don't count on it. The earpiece speaker works when you're listening to media along with the bottom speakers which seems like a good idea until it blows and sounds like crap all the time. The camera works great, just don't expect to be able to use this as a smartphone. I so wish I could take away that one star and make it a zero.

I have third party fix it warranty which I will use soon. I did some searches online and it seems like a few other have this problem and fixing did not help. Sad because I really like my phone. I had a pixel 6p before this. I should not be having this problem 6 months after purchase. Phone looks brand new...no damage whatsoever. It’s definitely a manufacturers fault.

Defective product!! Battery sucks!! in-bulit phone speaker is bad!!!,"I bought this item 3 weeks back and here I am sharing my experience. The camera and overall design of google pixel 3a is very good. However, within two days, I noticed the battery burns out too quickly. I mean after a full charge battery should stay for at least 18 h minimum, however in my case, it got discharged within like 6 h.My friend who bought the same model from a T mobile store, the battery life is good. It stays for 30 h. Also, the inbuilt speaker is so bad that I always had to use speaker option whenever someone was calling at my number. Amazon might have sent me a defective product.

BIG disappointment!,"Buyers, beware.How this particular Pixel 3a ever was approved to put in a box and sold to customers speaks volumes about this manufacturer's commitment to bona fide quality, and its respect for consumers.

Yes, had others try it too.All agreed, the worst-sounding cellphone they'd ever experienced.Indeed, it is being returned as this is written. (Sigh) Yes, the adage does come to mind, you get what you pay for! It's just terrible that even for $400-$500 one takes a risk.Indeed, researched it for 2 months and saw a few other lousy experiences, yet more seemed to like it.I got stuck with a problematic one which, I repeat, NEVER should've passed factory inspection … a phone that's inaudible on calls?!",2019年8月13日 在美国审核

Besides the screen the phone still works as it did the same day I received it, It is a little slow for my liking though.

It doesn't help that I paid $200 more for it thinking I was upgrading. The screen is so sensitive I cannot scroll without opening everything I touch, so frustrating!!! I've looked in settings, I've researched the issue, I have put on screen protectors to try to buffer it, I've had very tech savvy people look at it and try to figure it out and they can figure out everthing except this issue. I know it's not me because I still use other phones to shop and read things and I don't have that problem. Things I like about the phone: the bright colors on the screen are nice especially outside and the night sight picture taking is pretty cool plus it charges fast and holds a charge well. One more huge disappointment is it's 64 GB but it filled up so fast and I don't know why. I probably have less than half the apps that I had on my Honor 7X and it was a 32 GB. So what's up with that? No I would not recommend anybody buy this POS.",2020年6月25日 在美国审核

Basic phone functions and speaker stopped working after 6 months of use,"6 months after purchasing, the speaker stopped working. The phone does not ring when receiving a phone call. When I'm on a phone call or meeting (Google Hangout, Google Meet, WhatsApp call, etc.), I can hear fine if I hold the phone to my ear, but in speaker mode it goes silent. Sometimes the speaker turns back on temporarily but constantly emits a scratchy noise, like running one's nails over a chalkboard. For some reason, playing music or Youtube videos is fine but other functions are busted.I searched Google forums extensively and couldn't find any software fix. Many other users have reported these exact symptoms and they were told by Google that this is a hardware issue. I don't live in the U.S. and there is nowhere to get it fixed. Furthermore, on this product page I clicked the warranty link and it's broken.I have been a loyal Pixel user since 2016 and I'm very disappointed that a new model could break so easily.

BEWARE OF DEFECTS,"I was exceptionally disappointed in this device. I bought 3 of these devices in December 2019 for Christmas thru Amazon.

My device's battery life is crap (6-8 hours) with internet &amp; WiFi ""turned-off"" and with me not using it. After a few months I started to like it. Right when I became familiar with it and started to enjoy it in May 2020 (after 6 months), BAM! It quit working. Out of the blue. The phone no longer provides a ringtone, text notification, speaker phone, or dial pad tones. Other actions may have quit too; however I have not delved deep into this device to find out what else is wrong with. ""No"" it is a matter of re-adjusting my settings on this device to make it work. Apparently it is an internal hardware defect in the Google Pixel Device (not just the 3). I view phones as an investment; not only of my money but the trust I might invest in a company.

They are asking me to cover the cost of getting a refurbished device which is at $140. I contacted customer service was on hold for almost two hours to be told they couldn't help me. I was also told that damages might have happened in transit, yet if you request google packaging you are told that you are not liable for damages. Google doubles down and says that I sent the phone with my own packaging. Clearly a lie. I have the emails to prove otherwise. I respond, and now they will not respond back. For a phone that costs $300, it is a scam for a full product that will last maybe a year. Do not expect them to care or to assist you with anything.

Feeling cheated...don't buy!!,"I am writing this review after 6 months of pixel 3a used.Pros:1. Phone doesn't hang at all just like iPhone.2. Android 10 updates are awesome.3. Battery last for 22 hrs with moderate social media and gaming. Better than iPhone 8.4. Screen touch and finger print scanner works perfectly.5. Camera lens is awesome, able to capture some great pics.Cons:1. Slight sluggish with heavy graphics games like CSR2 and NFS.2. Face recognition feature is well missed.3. Fingerprint scanner must be on the screen instead behind but not a big deal though.4. Need to improve apps permission option i.e. why Google always want to know phone location, this causes serious battery drain.Suddenly one day a crackling sound came from speaker and you know what bottom speaker was gone. Google service is pathetic and they are unable to fix it or not replacing the device instead they offered me to take spare used phone. Which is bizzare from company like google, I would not suggest anyone to buy this device. If you are okay without hardware support from Google then buy else don't.

"Pefect size phone, very good camera","I wish that Google had simply pumped up the specs for the 2013 Nexus 5 phone. It was perfect in so many ways, but notably, size. It fit in any pocket and was a great PHONE. The camera wasn't very good, but that was its one weak point.I really miss that device. I moved to a Nexus 6 (Way too big) and then a Pixel XL in 2016. Great phone and also big, but lightning fast - even today. My daily driver is now a OnePlus 6T and it is also big. It has a nice bezel-less screen and loads app faster than I can call them up. But, after eight months of use, the battery no longer lasts all day like it did when new.All that is prelude to getting this new Google Pixel 3a - essentially the same phone as the Pixel 3, but in a more plasticy case and without the graphics processor to speed things up for the camera. Experts are proclaiming this phone to have a truely outstanding camera - state-of-the-art, no less. And it is good. But more about the shooter in a minute or two.The Pixel 3a - straight out of the box, is impressive. It is a smaller phone than many flagships out there, but I really like a phone that doesn't make me splay my fingers out when trying to do something one-handed with my phone. The display is very pleasant and the current version of the Android operating system is great. (My wife has an iPhone and occasionally asks for my help. I can't do half the stuff with IOS that I can do with Android, but I'm a bit biased.)The setup instructions are do-it-in-your-sleep simple, so if you hesitate upgrading because you've got a lot of stuff on your old phone, don't. The only hiccup I found was that one app on my eight month old OnePlus didn't transfer - it turns out that the app in question has been removed from the Google Play Store, so it wouldn't be moved to my new phone. What is curious to me is that most apps that get transferred to the new phone, using Google's transfer process, require you to log in with your username and password the first time you use them. OK, I get it. But, when I open up my saved wifi networks - some I haven't used in years - they're there and require no credentials. Not sure of the logic in this.The 64gb of internal storage is plenty for my needs - I generally don't store large video files on my phone nor have hundreds of apps. And, like the OnePlus, the phone is fast - apps load quickly.The 3a battery lasts all day for me, but it's brand new. Check back with me in a year.The phone comes with an earphone jack, so I can use my old wired headsets again. The battery charges very quickly, too. I can run the phone down to under 20%, plug it in for 15-20 minutes and get the battery back up to 45-50% - enough to last the rest of my day.So, about that camera. Is it all that it is cracked up to be? Is it amazing?Well, it is very good, but it surprised me that it isn't better than the camera on my OnePlus 6T. Now, to be honest, I did not use the night lighting feature. I'm sure it is nice, but I rarely, if ever, want to photograph things at night. If you do, then you might just adore the Pixel 3 camera. But to test out my observations, I took photos of a running fountain in my backyard on my original Pixel XL, my OnePlus 6T and the Pixel 3a. I looked at the resulting photos side-by-side on two identical monitors and judged them for color balance, hues and fine detail. In order of preference, the OnePlus came out first, then tne 3a, then the Pixel XL. The two pixel cameras had trouble with capturing the color of leaves and bark in the shaded portions of the photos. The OnePlus was more true to the colors in the actual scene and displaed more warmth. Details were slightly better on the two Pixel cameras, but not significantly better. Water droplets coming off the top tier of the fountain looked a bit more defined than on the OnePlus. This surprised me - Maybe I read too many critical reviews, but I thought that the OnePlus camera was one of its weaknesses - it isn't at all.In summary, the Pixel 3a is a fabulous phone. It comes in a convenient size and is backed up by two years of updates. The camera is very good and will reward you with very accurate photos. The software is quick like a bunny and transferring your old phone's applications to this one will be simple. You will like this phone a lot - and for about $400, it is a steal.",2019年7月18日 在美国审核
Really happy with this phone,I made the switch from a Pixel 2 to this device. I love the battery life. I'm no longer concerned my phone will die during the day. The camera is great. Portrait mode is perfect for taking pictures of my young son. iIme lapse has created some hilarious videos as well (pro tip: record your kiddo eating and it is hilarious).Ya'll are getting ripped off if you are spending more on a phone cause this meets all my needs.Full Disclosure: I purchased from Google Store because Amazon wasn't selling these on the day they got announced.,2019年5月18日 在美国审核
A Game Changer!,"It is good that many companies are offering budget, mid-range, and premium Android phones according to consumer's need. The consumers then have choices according to their need or preference. However as everyone knows - the camera quality in budget and mid-range phones simply cannot compete with iPhones or more expensive Android phones. For me, I don't care about the camera, just meeting my daily needs on the phone - so I just use budget to mid-range phones (so Moto E4 and X4 are more than sufficient for me). But my wife, no 1 priority in her phone is the camera. Performance and battery life, she doesn't really care. But we BOTH do not want to spend $1000 on a phone.Enter Pixel 3a. This smartphone is a game changer. At $399, it has enough power to satisfy every day users (non-gamers) and those who love to take great pictures. Snapdragon 670 is faster than Moto X4 (sd 630) and Xperia XZs (sd 820). Armed with 4GB RAM it can handle every day tasks well. But when it comes to the performance of its camera - it has been universally praised (just check YouTube reviews on it). It really does take better pictures than iPhones (6,7,8, XR) and some of the premium Android phones. My wife is SOOOOO happy with this phone! It performs better and takes amazing pictures than her Xperia XZs. And it only costs $399.HINTS:1. Once you get the phone, you might not see your phone charging. Don't panic. That's OK. [It was for me too. It was stuck at 84%]. Leave it hooked up. Just update all the security patches. Once you have the most recent security patch updated. Then -&gt;2. Factory Reset your phone. This will ensure erase all the glitches and have clean install of your Android Pie. You will also note that the phone is charging normally (fast charging works as intended).3. Download your apps and enjoy the phone!4. Get a good case and tempered glass screen protector. Pixel 3a comes with Dragontrail Glass and not Gorilla Glass. They are similar in quality, but Dragontrail is little better with scratches than GG, but GG is little better with drop test. So you just want to reinforce the screen with tempered glass protection. So when it is dropped, then tempered glass will shatter but protects Pixel 3a screen.Overall, we are completely satisfied with Pixel 3a. My wife really loves the phone! So if you want to take great pictures and to see snappy performance of the phone but don't want to spend $1000, then Pixel 3a is BEST choice. Highly recommended!",2019年7月11日 在美国审核
The right phone for many of us,"I didn’t need my pixel 3a.I had a Huawei mate 10 Pro which I got a good deal on.What prompted me to change was that my wife wanted a phone with a better camera,and I like the idea of guaranteed updates for 3 years.My wife took my mate 10 Pro and I bought a pixel 3a for $399 with a $100 gift card to a store I shop often enough at to make the price for me $299 actual.Likes:Screen: it is a slightly above full HD screen with it being 5.6 Inch the pixels are packed tight.I have heard some say the screen is a bit oversaturated and I am inclined to believe it.Still, though pixel 3a has avery sharp OLED display.I still like my mate more even though it is not as sharp.Performance: with a 670 snapdragon, that is about as powerful as an 835 from a couple of years ago, the performance is good.I just realistically, can’t believe many folks would complain about this.Storage is adequate with 64 GB.Camera: I am not a camera pro or anywhere close.I appreciate a good camera on a phone because it makes someone like me look like I know how to take good shots.This camera achieves that.I hear all the reviews that rant and rave about the pixel camera and I am just not much a camera guy to know what it all means but at the end of the day it takes good looking photos.OS:I have used many phones with their own Android skin on top, and it feels refreshing to use a phone with stock android.The experience is good and I enjoy the simple user experience.Battery life: Great.I charge my phone every 2 days and I could probably go to 2.5 or possibly more without charging.I use my phone lightly throughout the day.Neutral:Design:the pixel 3a has a vanilla design.It is long with large for today’s standards lower and upper bezels.The phone is not ugly just not exciting either.It reminds me of the older iPhone models that were not exciting compared to other phones but worked well and didn’t look unattractive either.Build:The phone is made of polycarbonate (plastic) which is not a problem for me, but I have used phones with better builds at this same price range. The back picks up smears easily.Features:there is no wireless charging, which is not a huge deal for me because I have only 1 phone with it and never used it. No waterproofing is a bummer but again not major it just means during a heavy rainstorm I have to be careful.Dislike:Screen rotation:must have got the software from Sony because my biggest annoyance is the screen rotation.When I am using my phone in portrait mode, sometimes it will just auto-rotate to landscape-way too sensitive.I know I can turn auto-rotate off but I am used to using it.No, hide the navigation bar:on my mate phone, I was able to hide the nav bar when browsing which gave me extra screen real estate.Conclusion:I like the phone it has the early iPhone feel I mentioned earlier with just being simple to use and vanilla looking.I like that this is a first party phone and works with other Android compatible products pretty seamlessly.If you are like me and have used many different brands you know of the perks I have having your phone just being compatible with all things.Nothing worse than getting the phone you want then having it be incompatible with your smartwatch, or android auto.Stock apps just worked out of the box, like visual voice mail.I have a pixel slate and do not suffer any glitches when linking my pixel 3s like when I would link my mate 10 Pro.For an average everyday user, there is nothing to dislike.It is probably not a phone for someone who wants the most premium high-end phones with the latest greatest but it does offer a focal point for those of us that want a nice phone but don’t want to break the bank.The problem with Android, in my opinion, has been oversaturation.There are a lot of nice phones but finding ones that work on your network, work with all features in your country and other compatibility issues can be an exercise in frustration.The pixel 3a is a brand name phone with a mid-range price that can help with people feeling overwhelmed when shopping for a phone.There are certainly better-looking phones, better priced, better specs, nothing but the pixel 3a puts a lot of features you want in a recognized name brand without emptying your wallet.",2019年6月9日 在美国审核
"Excellent phone,fast responsive with most of the features people use","This is a very good way to get the best of google/android without spending a thousand dollars for a flagship phone from a major manufacturer.One of the best things I found is the phone screening call feature that is built in.There is something satisfying about hitting the screen button on a listed “scam call” and the caller hanging up.I have also found these people don’t call back again and again.The band 71 for T-Mobile 5g is going to be great once it comes to my area,I believe this is one of the cheapest 5g capable phones available now.The squeeze to wake google assistant works well ,I also like the feel and texture of the plastic type phone.It doesn’t feel cheap or flimsy at all.The only real thing missing is the ability to add a sd card to expand beyond 64 gb ,that and some people with iQ charging vehicles or power pads might miss that.Being a google phone,updates are pushed immediately another nice feature.Touch response is excellent,scrolling and figure print unlocking all work well.Battery life is no problem,I haven’t evyhit 20% even after using it a lot in a day.Bluetooth and hotspot connections are all very easy and work every time. Camera is probably better than an iPhone 8 or Samsung 9 and Google photo unlimited storage integration is seamless of course.You can get this new for about half the price of an iPhone Xr or Samsung 10 ,it definitely the phone 90% of the people would buy and not notice any difference.",2019年7月22日 在美国审核
Worth More Than the Price,"In a world where your new average smart phone price lies around $1000, the Google Pixel 3a is a gift from the gods. I purchased this phone from Google directly over 2 years ago, and it is still going very strong. To make this review concise, I'll make a list of pros and cons:Pros:1. The price for what you are getting is unbeatable. Can't emphasize this enough.2. Headphone jack. Not everyone has bluetooth headphones, and this allows you to use old school headphones.3. Battery life is still good after all of this time.4. Plastic resin case is a pro and a con (for some). I use a case as does 90% of the population with their phone, so the plastic resin casing doesn't bother me.5. Always up-to-date with the latest Google software, since it is directly made by Google themselves.6. Additional speaker via the ear piece is both a pro and a con (original Pixel only had one speaker @ bottom of phone).7. Storage is plenty for me with assistance from the Google Photos app (unlimited storage with some caveats).8. Camera is fantastic even for a lower model. This was an original selling point for the Pixel phone, regardless.9. Fingerprint sensor still good after all of this time.10. For what you are paying for, the screen is great. As phone screens are absurdly smaller than your TV, the human eye will not notice much difference in resolution / quality on this scale, anyways.Cons:1. As stated before, the plastic resin casing will be off-putting for some folks, but you know that when buying this phone.2. Ear piece speaker is a little odd along with the speaker at the bottom. They're not too great, but it doesn't really bother me.3. Ringtones are either really loud or quiet. This is probably more of a programming thing versus the speakers. If you have your ringtone / sounds set to the loudest, it'll be LOUD. One step down and it drops several decibels. I usually have it set at the latter.Hope this helps you buyers out there. Through several smartphones in my life, this is the best one I've ever owned.",2021年12月15日 在美国审核
"Excellent, excellent phone!","I'm a little bit of a phone nerd, using both Androids and iOS devices, always staying up on both, and on the Android side I almost always prefer a stock Android Pixel device, and previously the Nexus model line of phones. This one is great, and they just continually get better.Why is this one great!?1.Small2.Great Price3. Fantastic Camera!!!4. FAST! I read some reviews that tried to dump on the processor but this thing is FAST regardless5. Latest/Greatest android6. Light weight7. Very well made8. Great screenI always carry a larger phone as my primary, but travel with a smaller phone in my backpack as a backup for the work travel and globe trotting. This phone is nearly perfect.The only thing I haven't liked is battery life. Everyone says it's supposed to be great, but even turning off the always on clock screen I still don't get tremendous battery life with it.Fully recommended, run, don't walk on this one. I hope they keep up this trend!",2019年7月14日 在美国审核
A Pixel phone for someone that misses Nexus phones,"Being an unlocked Pixel phone, purchased from Google (assuming you purchase from Google and not Verizon, etc.), you will have timely security updates pushed OTA. Unfortunately, other manufacturers prioritize wacky UI customizations over keeping their phone builds maintainable and providing timely security updates. Right now Google is guaranteeing updates until May 2022.Battery life on this Pixel 3a is just as good as my Pixel 3: *excellent.* I use my phone through throughout the day for sending emails, finding answers to life's most important questions during work meetings, getting distracted on social media. At the end of each day, it's not uncommon that I read an ebook, search for a new project on Pinterest/Ravelry/whatever, or scroll through my Instagram for a few hours. I've not yet managed to trigger a low battery warning on the 3a (partially because I haven't had it as long) and only triggered it a couple of times on my Pixel 3. I haven't compared the actual capacities of the two, but just from use, they seem to be at least similar in their greatness. With this phone, you can successfully bombard your eyeballs with too many hours digital pixels every day!The 3a is noticeably lighter than the Pixel 3. If you prefer a lighter phone, this might be a big deal to you. Again, I haven't paid attention to the spec sheet, just to what I can observe through casual (unscientific) use.The 3a is a decent amount cheaper. So if you're on somewhat of a budget, this may be a factor for you. Sure, this isn't a ultra cheap phone, but in comparison to your other Pixel options, the price is good and comparable to the Nexus of the good olde days.The 3a has a flatter screen than the 3. If you've cursed at finding a screen protector that doesn't peel at the edges (or stop 1/4"" short of the edges to avoid peeling) this is a big deal. My Pixel 2 managed to get a light scratch in the screen while sitting on my desk during the first hour I owed it--I could have sworn nothing even toughed it! I just don't skip screen protectors anymore, especially with an $800 (at least at the time I got a 3) device.The 3a has a headphone jack (at the cost of water resistance).I have no problems with phone calls, but then I use Google Fi, so switching phones is a seamless experience. I just logged into the new phone (esim) and everything comes back. Your experience of course may vary if you're moving Apple--&gt;Android, using a different carrier, don't back up your settings to Google, etc.Overall, if the 3a had been available at the time the 3 was released, I would have purchased it instead. I may have had some worry that maybe I was missing out on something (there are a few feature differences--the dual-selfie cam to zoom out, if you're into selfies, and water resistance--comes to mind). But overall, this does not disappoint.It more than fills the void that has been missing since Google moved from Nexus to Pixel.",2019年7月12日 在美国审核
Possibly the Best Value Phone Still,"Folks, if you are comfortable with the Android system - and need a great phone and don't have the money to spend on what you ""want"".... DO NOT HESITATE to buy this phone if it's in your price range.I own the Pixel 2XL, this phone (Pixel 3a) and Pixel 4.I like this phone every bit as much as the other 2. I like each for different reasons. But I love them all. I have owned multiple Samsung, LG, and Motorola Android phones since 2011. I will very likely never purchase anything but Pixel phones from now on if Google can maintain the quality they are right now.So, as to the this phone, I've used it for something like 6 full months now. I've used it with T-Mobile and PagePlus (Verizon network). I've re-formatted it three times as I've used it as something of a test bed phone (no, it's not given me any trouble to cause the re-formatting).Things I love, like, and wish were different:What I Love: clean, simple, well-built style and size. Tons of cases and such to pick from. Beautiful screen. Amazingly fast and accurate fingerprint reader. And the camera... it's equal in every way to my Pixel 2XL camera, and honestly, 90% of the time it's just as good as my Pixel 4 camera (speaking of real-world usage and results - not getting technical here). Pixel cameras for the average Joe and Jane are on par with iPhone IMO. I have never used any other phone with anything comparable to Pixel(s) as far as camera results are concerned. You'll be amazed by the quality and power of the camera. Take some time, experiment, and you'll get excellent results. The attached photo is just a sample, totally untouched from the phone. What else... Ah.. yes... my favorite thing of all: SPEED. I cannot stress enough how much I hate, dislike, loath, and am irritated by using a phone that is laggy and not responsive. I could not freaking care less about ""decorations"" and fancy ""actions"" in the minimizing and maximizing of apps. I care about responsiveness and that I DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT for the phone to respond. The Pixel 3a is every bit as responsive in use and feel as my other two Pixels. I have yet to use any other phone, iPhone included, that has remained as constant in this area as all three Pixels I own. Pay attention to memory, remove apps you don't need, use cloud backup for your docs and photos, and you have a phone that will remain uber fast in everyday use - and honestly, after you've had the phone for a few months... what else really matters after the newness of the thing has past? Also, I really love the size of this phone. I like it so much, I chose a standard Pixel 4 instead of an XL to match the 3a in my hand.What I just Like: with all I've just said, I must admit that I'm not a fan of Google's default ""launcher"". Just too boring and, well, I don't know. I just only, well, like it alright. I've been mostly using Evie launcher to give me a bit more control and options (yea, try that with your iPhone). I also only ""like"" the amount of screen to ""black"" ratio on the front of the phone. This is not a premium phone - but even my Pixel 4 is not much better. Several other manufacturers have this ratio better - where nearly the entire front of the phone is screen... I don't know, it's just more premium feeling and appearing at first touch and view.What I wish were different: aside from my like section above (the screen) I do wish the battery life was better. For around 2 months it was amazing. But one negative about the way Google pushes out the constant updates for their Pixels (dude... it's like all the time... every 2-3 weeks I get some kind of update) is that I've noticed battery life is always affected. It'll get better after an update and I'm thrilled! Then, a few weeks later, I'll get another update and it'll kill my battery life by 25%! Right now, I can barely get a full day of heavy use out of it.After you use it for a while it's just a smartphone that you develop habits with - like every other one you've had. If you're the type that hates to change anything, well stick with what you have already and save your tech- minded friends the grief of teaching you how to make everything like it was before (*clears throat* you hear me iPhone users?).If you like and have invested a little in the Android system, you will love this phone, I think.",2020年2月1日 在美国审核
best phone I ever owned,"I always bought phones in the 200-300 range and of course it showed, there is usually a lack of quality, the camera is mediocre and some of the cool functions are not included. I'm glad I found the Pixel 3a, this is the best phone in the mid-range price out there. I know it is slightly more than my past range, but I finally wanted a phone that does more, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I read tons of reviews and watched several videos to make sure I'm not wasting my money (it's still a huge junk of change for me). I can say with delight, this phone is amazing.Pros:- The camera is wonderful, it makes great pictures in low light, at night and has so many filters and options... I can't say enough how awesome the camera is.- The battery life is amazing, my phone only lasted through the day if I didn't do anything. This phone lasts all day even with some gaming (1-2h).- Basic Android with minimal bloatware- I was able to transfer almost all my data with no issues or hick-ups- There is a headphone jack - wahooo (I guess I'm old school,but I like it)- I love the fast charging option, never had it before and it is great getting 70% in 20min- Super light and compact, I do appreciate the size and that this phone is smaller than my oldCons:- no wireless chargingI can't say much about material, the material seems to be the same as all my old phones. My friend with an Iphone of course pointed out that it looks cheap, but really.... I don't know anything else, so I don't care. I would totally buy it again and my husband is looking forward to getting one too. Thumbs up!",2019年6月13日 在美国审核
The Mainstream Pixel (Follow-up Review),"All too many reviewers approached the Pixel 3a and 3aXL as alternative to a flagship - I didn't. I looked at the Pixel 3a as being a mainstream/midrange ""utility infielder"" of a phone that is actually priced sanely - all too many phones - especially flagships - aren't.I was coming from the Samsung Galaxy S7 - a flagship of its day - and I was the second owner.The S7 has a rather large screen - and flagship screens have gotten larger since; look at the S10 - even the S10e.Phones that size have definite ""pocket issues"" - as in too big for most pockets.Shirts, jeans,etc., - and then you wonder why ""butt-dialing"" happens.The 3a, on the other hand, fits nicely into a FRONT pocket - which makes the ""butt dial"" flatly impossible.(You can't dial with your kiester if you aren't sitting on your phone.)It doesn't support SD cards - something I hardly used on my S7.(I still have the 32 GB SD card I bought the same time I got the phone, and it's not even half full.Therefore, not that big a deal.)One thing that has been bragged on with Pixels in general - and this one in particular - is the camera.Surprise - it matters much less - at least to me.In the year I had the S7 in service, I took less than twenty pictures with it.Yes, you read that right - twenty.Unless things change radically, I don't see that number taking off, even with the Pixel 3a at hand..One issue that certainly mattered to me is the length of support -typical smartphone update support runs for two years or the same number of major releases - even for flagships.Two companies- and only two - go longer than that - Apple and Google.Apple is not exactly a featured name in the sane end of smartphone pricing; until recently, the Google Pixel was not in the sane end of pricing eitherthe 3a (and bigger-brother 3aXL) differ from previous Pixels in the US another way - it's not chained to Verizon like an ill-tempered pit bull.You can put it on almost any carrier without having to jump through any hoops.I'm on Tracfone, and have been getting solid service from them; therefore, I did not want to leave them, if at all avoidable.With the 3a, I didn't have to leave.Remove SIM from S7 - insert in 3a.That's it.Easier than migrating from a Big Four carrier.(And all from the comfort of my bedroom sitting chair after lunch.)Q-based operations has been just as free from pain; I signed up (online, and from my desktop) within an hour of unpacking the phone itself, with the first drop showing up over OTA within fifteen minutes of that.(Tracfone, remember?)So far, I have a grand total of ONE issue with Q - and it's a quibble - no dark-mode launch screen with beta 5/RC1 - despite enabling systemwide dark mode starting with beta 4.That's it.Why I bought it, and why I recommend it - are easy enough to explain - it's a mainstream utility-infielder of a phone that does what you need it to, will be supported for at least three years (if not forever, which is Pixel Practice - remember, even the original Pixel is still getting OS and security updates); it has nothing to do with the camera.#teampixel#whatcamera?FOLLOW UP - It's October 25th; said Pixel 3a is still going strong.I'm putting it to uses I haven't - and would not dare - do any other phone.I have actually streamed TV to it; something that would normally be the province of either my TV or my tablet.So why the Pixel?It has an AMOLED display - which only one TV in the house does - and it isn't the one in MY bedroom.You read that right - AMOLED at a sane price.Basketball (the WNBA Finals, to be precise).College football.The NFL.The MLB postseason (from the NLDS to the World Series).None of it has a single issue on the clear AMOLED display of my Pixel 3a.Also, the camera is actually getting a workout - because the pictures are so clear and crisp, I am using it to take pictures of receipts for item exchange.(And that is before updating the APK to Camera 7.x from the Pixel 4 - which is also available to all other Pixels.)My mom is even pickier about pictures than I am - for that reason, she purchased a refurbished original Pixel herself - and then promptly started kicking herself; she turned DOWN getting a 3a or 3a XL for Mother's Day.(Her option - and from me.)If you can find a decent refurbished Pixel, that's an option as well.",2019年7月10日 在美国审核
"Good Phone, Great value","I switched from an iPhone 6S. In comparison to that it's a clear upgrade. I've also played around for a while on my wife's iPhone 11. That phone is more than twice the price but I think the 3A, while definitely not a better phone, can give it a nice run for its money.Pros- I like Android 10 more than I thought I would. Lots of clever polish to the UI.- Camera is great. Significantly better than my 6S, though not as good as the iPhone 11.- Size is on the smaller side, at least relative to what's available, which I was looking for in a phone. I'd prefer if it were even smaller, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a market for it.- Battery is generally good. Not great, but enough to get me through the day.Cons- Screen scratches very easily. I never used a screen protector during my many years of using iPhones. I simply never needed one, despite dropping my phone many times. I dropped my 3A once and it caused a noticeable scratch across the center of the screen. (Now I bought a screen protector, of course!)- I've needed to calibrate the compass around every week or so. Not sure why it needs to be done so frequently.- Maybe it's a problem with WhatsApp and not the phone, but answering phone calls on WA is a huge pain. I swipe up to answer but that simply changes it to a different to two bubble icons, and those don't work either when I press the one to answer.- No waterproofing and no wireless charging. I wonder whether they don't have these features because they are really so costly to implement or if it was just a way to further differentiate the phone from the Pixel 3 and 4.Overall the phone is a great value. With the $100 price drop to $299 it's a steal.",2019年12月19日 在美国审核
"Premium features, budget friendly price","Don't know why anyone would say this phone is outdated when it has the most current version of Android 9 and is guaranteed three years of system and security updates.

Buying this phone is a no brainer.,"What is not to like? For the price, you are getting a phone comparable to the top phones at a more reasonable price. with similar features.Screen, nice large bright display, yet still can be used with one hand. No issues seeing the screen even in the bright of day.Speedy, for me most phones are fast enough for my needs. This is very responsive for every task I need.Camera, this is a stand-out feature. Great images and it has a ""Night Vision"" feature that is too cool when taking pictures at night. I used it on a recent cruise and the pics of the moon over the water with amazing.Interface, I like the (relatively) clean Android interface, not a lot of bloatware, and easy to make it more comfortable for the way I like.Headphone jack, I know, I know, Bluetooth. I have some really nice wired headphones and earbuds that I can still keep using them makes me happy.Battery life, I use my phone all day, calls and texts, streaming and stored music, newsreaders and kindle books, social media, and camera. I have gotten a full day with some time to spare out of it.Connectivity, Bluetooth, Wifi, and cellular all have good solid connections, easy to configure and connect. We did a month-long trip overseas and in the states, I never had an issue with getting the phone to connect and keeping the signal.Folks are fussing over the lack of wireless charging, waterproofing, the build and storage (64GB). Honestly, none of those were issues for me, wireless charging is nice but, eh.The waterproof thing, again not a big issue, have yet to drop a phone in water, wine, toilet, lake, ocean, pond or puddle yet.Storage is 64GB onboard, then add in unlimited space from Google and it really becomes a non-issue.As for the build (plastic rather than glass on the back), it feels just fine to me. As I keep mine in a case anyway. Glass on the back just one more thing to break if dropped.Now my Cons:Speaker, I wish it were a bit louder, it is not anemic by any account, but a bit more umphf would be nice.NFC and connectivity with iOS devices. Not the phone's issue per se, but it would be nice to be able to share pics, and such with Apple devices like iPhones or iPads.Connecting to a Mac, again more an Android issue, but you have to jump through fiery hoops to get anything to or from this phone and a Mac.I may be a glass half full kinda guy, but this is a really nice phone when you compare the features to the price. I would love to get a Galaxy Note again (I use the stylus to sketch), but at over double the price for essentially a stylus, buying this phone is a no brainer.",2019年8月23日 在美国审核

The Google Pixel 3a goes back to what made the original Google Nexus phones great,"The Google Pixel 3a goes back to what made the original Google Nexus phones great.The Pixel 3a may not have the bleeding edge specs of the flagship phones, but at its current price point the Pixel 3a delivers great performance along with the amazing camera that most users can afford.In our family, we generally upgrade every 2 years but as the prices of phones have kept increasing our ability to keep up the latest and greatest has waned.It's nice to see that Google finally provided a feature rich device that delivers on what most users want.One of the reasons we now have 3 pixel 3a phones in our family is because of the guaranteed 3 years of updates.Having owned competing brands with amazing specs we were quickly disappointed with updates that were long promised but delivered months behind other android pure devices.Considering how older android operating systems are being targeting now, its nice to know that we have the most up to date secure operating systems available.The next selling point has to be the class leading 12.2 megapixel rear camera which is the same one as in the original flagship Pixel 3.It has class leading performance in low light settings and often ranked first in comparison to other camera phones.The other specs are nominal in comparison to competing brands but in hand its such a nice sleek product.Pages flow and open quickly without much lag even with slower snapdragon 670 processor, but I'm sure having 4gb of ram definitely helps.64gb of storage, head phone jack, 3000mah battery, and a beautiful Oled screen makes it feel like a much more expensive handset.The phones may not have wireless charging or a premium metal case but for most users those don't have much impact on the user experience.Most users like myself buy a nice phone case and glass screen protector immediately so have a cheaper outer shell isn't a deal breaker.Overall, there are not too many real competitors in this space at this price point unless its an older model flagship.Take my money already Google.5 stars",2019年7月13日 在美国审核
Perfect phone for basically everyone,"I've had Android phones going back to the Samsung Galaxy S3.I really do like Samsung phones, however when they came out with the S10 line and their ""cheap"" phone was $750, this made me pause.I had an unlocked Galaxy S7 and it was a very solid phone, however, i got updates way slower than everyone else since it was unlocked and updates first went to the major carriers.But then....Google announced the ""a"" versions of their Pixels and this totally got my attention.You still get the same Pixel camera (which even iPhone users know is the best phone camera available) with instant updates for half the price of a ""regular"" Pixel.Sure, it doesn't have wireless charging, but honestly, that's far from a deal breaker.Sure, it's not waterproof, but, i've never come close to needing that with a phone in the past, so why should that matter.Sure, it doesn't have as fast of a processor as a regular Pixel, but i'm not a heavy gamer so it doesn't matter at all.Anyway, the things they had to ""skimp"" in order to lower the price really don't matter.This is a very nice phone and at this point, i'm hooked on Pixel.The screen is bright and clear.The battery life is totally amazing...you really don't even have to charge it every day...i still do because i always want as much juice as possible.This thing is also quite zippy with opening apps and so on.I will miss the expandable memory card from my Galaxy, but, that is the only thing i miss at this point.The pros far outweigh the cons with this phone.I hope they keep making ""a"" version of the Pixel going forward...if they do, i'm a Pixel owner for life!",2019年8月5日 在美国审核
Amazing camera and battery life,"Coming off from an LG g5, this phone is a big upgrade even though it's a mid level phone. I traded the LG to get the pixel 3a via TMobile.<br>Pros:- Always get the latest Android- No bloat ware from TMobile- Camera quality is great compared to my previous phone. This is especially helpful when depositing checks.- Apps like Tesla actually works much better.- Even though it uses a budget processor, the apps and phone's functions are very snappy (Android system on Android phone helps?)- Battery is amazing and the fast charging is as promised. I only need to charge the phone for about 30 minutes or so to get to from 50 to 90%. This will last about a day worth of light usage or half a day worth more screen time.I've used this phone for about a month, but I've little drawbacks.- The display is great with improved clarity and sharpness compared to the older LG.- Keyboard and swiping function is much better compared to the LG.Con:- No option for turning off the screen with double-tap? I can only use the power button to execute this function.- Can't think of another but will update is anything arises.Update: speaking of update, just installed new Android 10 and it's even snappier than ever. You may have to manually search for the new software in your setting like I did since it wasn't pushed.- Dark mode is great.- Phone feels quicker.- New gestures.- Improved battery life (maybe because of dark mode?)?- Still no double tab to turn off screen, only double tab to turn on.</br>",2019年6月17日 在美国审核
Great phone at reasonable price,"The unlocked Pixel 3a is a great mid-range phone!Just understand this is a mid-range phone and hence why the price is around $400, instead of $800-1,000+.I originally bought the Moto G7 but wasn't thrilled with it due to sub-par battery life and no wifi-calling, so decided to return and spend an extra $100 for the Pixel 3a.So far I'm totally thrilled with my 3a.I like the smaller size, love that it has wifi-calling on Verizon and the battery gives me close to a full day with normal use.The 3a also has much tighter reception (mobile and wifi), speeds are faster. Also the 3a has NFC which is a nice bonus.Since I don't take many pictures I can't comment here but I understand the 3a has a great camera, if not the best, for those that care.I wish it had better water protection but overall I easily rate it a 5 for the price.The G7 was nice, but get the 3a if you can spare the extra $100.",2019年7月16日 在美国审核
"Good bye apple, Hello Google","The Google Pixel 3a is not what I was expecting but in the very best way! I have used iPhones for a number of years. However when I recently wanted to upgrade my phone the iPhones on the market we're way out of my price range and I honestly didn't want to sign up for a plan having a monthly payment. I looked into many phones and decided on the Google Pixel 3a. I was surprised how it came with a transfer cable so I didn't loose any of my pictures or music from my old phone. How majority of the apps I had were added as well and all I had to do was sign in again. The camera works amazingly and I no longer have to worry about running out of room for my memories. While the layout and some of the applications are a bit different, I am now a converted Google Fan ! Goodbye Apple, Hello Google!....but bare in mind that u can now get this phone cheaper than amazon at the tmobile store.",2019年7月24日 在美国审核
Incredible Camera,"The pixel 3a is a phone that delivers gorgeous pictures without breaking your bank. One of the most important things for me in a phone is the camera because when you're a person that travels a lot you always want to have that great camera to capture beautiful places. I was in need of a new phone and I really did not want to spend lots of money on a phone, however, most phones with quality cameras are start at $700+ so I did my research and came across the pixel 3a I bought mine for $299 at Best buy for connecting with Sprint and got a free Google home mini with my purshase! I took it with me on my trips, took some pictures and people thought that my pictures were taken with a professional camera!! Also the phone charges super fast thanks to the 18 watt charger. This phones is not water resistant but how many times are you going to drop your phone in water?? It does not have wireless charging which is no biggie for me because you usually have to buy the wireless chargers separately anyway. And it does have a plastic body which I don't mind because I will be using a phone cover anyway. All I can say is that my money was well spent and the phone is very good for the money I paidhopefully Google will continue to release these budget versions of their phones in the future!",2019年7月21日 在美国审核
"Best phone for the $, period!","The screen, camera, and battery life alone make this phone a solid value for it's price. That doesn't even get a list of this device's pros started. It's built and maintained by Google with guaranteed updates for three-years. There is hardly a noticeable difference between I and it's pricier sibling and if you have the Google branded case applied, anyone on the street would be hard-pressed to tell the two apart based on aesthetics alone. Once you pick it up, there still is not a notable difference in day to day use, or speed doing all the phone things that phones do. This device might be a hair slower to process certain tasks, but not enough to discount it's nearly halved price tag.Before this phone I used the Moto G7, and while a great feeling phone, I chose to keep the pixel 3a as my daily driver and have the G7 to a family member who now also has one of the top budget phones. The G7 just doesn't have that Pixel wow, that kept me picking it up over the latter.Hopefully Google will continue this trend with a Pixel 4a, if I can keep from picking up the Pixel 4 after rejoining the Pixel family after the Nexus program began to flop miserably. This 3a though, is reminiscent of the Nexus glory days of the Nexus 4 and 5x.",2019年6月18日 在美国审核
Google OS. Crisp. Fast. No thrill.,"I'm not one of those phone fanatics always getting the latest and greatest flagship phone. In fact, I was using my HTC M8 until recently which was 4+ yrs old. I had to replace the HTC battery twice and the micro usb port like 3 times. It was just time to let it go. Even to the very end I was able to play mobile games like Marvel Future Fight on a 4 yr old phone.Now when it comes to getting a new phone I wanted a vanilla phone like the Android Ones or the Pixel line due to the fact that manufacturers of phones are notoriously slow in updating their phones which poses security and vulnerability issues.Not google Pixel. Updates are pushed when it's officially release.So Pixel was my choice after review different options. Not only was the Pixel 3a and 3a XL perfectly time for me it wasn't going to rob me blind.What I like:-Superb camera taking-Finger security is awesomely convenient-Snappy-Android Updates-Battery life is long!-USB C (must have USBC 18w chargers to optimize charging speed)Not so awesome:-Bland design-Not edge to edge with notch display but for the prize that's expected-Buying USB C wall and car chargers to utilize fast charging",2019年6月17日 在美国审核
"Good phone, great camera","I was really excited to get to try this phone and compare it coming from my Moto X4.What I like: - the camera takes great photos (especially in low light), much better than the Moto X4 - timely updates to Android - functions unique(?) to Pixel phones (like call screening)What's OK: - I expected the screen (being OLED) to be better than the one on my Moto X4 but it's about the same - I expected the overall performance to be noticeably faster than the Moto X4 but it's about the sameWhat's not OK - no FM radio, Google somehow does not like it, even though it's built into almost all phone chipsets - location of fingerprint on back (I need to pick up the phone off the desk to unlock it or type in the PIN)Finally my copy has an overly sensitive microphone that picks up nearby noise and amplifies it to noticeable levels. I contacted Google and they seem to think that it's a problem specific to my unit. They suggested that I contact Amazon to have it fixed. I haven't done that yet as it it's not annoying enough yet.",2019年8月11日 在美国审核
"The best Android phone for the buck, so I bought two of them!","I finally decided to go back to Android after having switched to an iPhone 7 plus for several years from Android. I should say that the 7 plus is great phone, with an excellent camera and a speedy processor, however, I was tired of the giant bezels on the ends of the phone and the LCD screen (albeit it it's a great LCD screen) . As I did not want to pay $1OOO to pay for the latest iPhone (I know the iPhone 11 doesn't cost that much, but it still has an LCD screen).I knew that I wanted a Pixel phone, for the software updates and great camera, but again did not want to pay an arm and a leg for the Pixel 4-- the Pixel 3 and 3 XL have their own issues. So I did my research, read the glowing reviews about this phone and took the plunge (it helped that Google was going to give me $400 for an old iPhone SE I had lying around).All that being said I could not be happier with this phone and it's bigger sister the Pixel 3XL.The screen on both phones is fantastic and despite the fact that neither has the latest 855 processor, the both perform like champs. And Android 10 has made their performance just that much better. I won't go on about the camera, as it's been established that the Pixel camera is pretty much the best camera you can have on a phone.So if you want to take the plunge into Android, want a phone with all the great features I mentioned above and don't want to pay and arm and a leg for it--this is the phone for you!",2020年1月28日 在美国审核
This phone is excellent! Take it from an audiophile!,"Like many other reviewers, I can confirm that this would be an excellent device for almost any user. I am myself a demanding user :). An audiophile. The on-board audio codecs and overall capability of the device to work with DACs matter to me more than the quality of the camera or the accuracy of the fingerprint sensor. And yet - the Pixel 3a XL excels at all these! The camera makes wonderful pictures and keeps the size manageable (3-4 MB per picture). The battery is solid. The screen is bright and clear. The colors are rich. And the audio is really good. The quality of the calls is excellent, the call volume is loud enough. The phone also happens to be among the few models that have the Qualcomm aptX HD Bluetooth codec which allows great music listening experience with wireless headphones (at hi-res depth that exceeds CD quality). No Samsung or Apple phones come equipped with the aptX HD codec (a few Asus, Motorola, and LG models do).A few minor cons:- No micro SD card slot. The phone, though, works with an external card reader well (make sure the the micro SD card which you put in the reader is formatted first to FAT32).-When making portrait pictures, the phone saves two copies of each picture and you have to use third party software or log into Google Photos to remove manually the redundant copies.-The phone is not waterproofI've been using it happily for the past few weeks and I am very, very pleased with my purchase. My old phones were mid-range models from Nokia and Motorola, and this one is superior to them.",2019年12月7日 在美国审核
Premium Features at an Economical Price,"In this current arms race where the big players compete to offer flagship phones with ever increasing prices, often in excess of $1000, it is great to see a quality mid-range offering from Google. The Pixel 3A is Google’s mid-range offering, priced lower than its more expensive sibling, the Pixel 3. At this price-point, the Pixel 3A offers a great value.The best thing about Pixel phones is their outstanding photo quality. This quality is achieved through a combination of hardware and the Pixel’s photo software. The software is so exceptional at creating great photos that many users will sideload the Google Camera APK onto other manufacturer’s phones to utilize it (I’ve done it on my Samsung.) The 3A’s photo performance is no exception – it delivers consistent, high- quality photographs. Its portrait mode is amazing - subjects really pop. I am also a sucker for low-light photography, which can easily be ruined by a flash or graininess. The Pixel 3A’s “Night Sight” mode takes amazing low-light photos. I compared the 3A’s low-like pictures, side-by-side, to my Samsung Note 8 (which has dual cameras vs the 3A’s single camera) and the 3A’s low-light pics were more detailed and sharper despite coming from a single camera.The 3A comes with 4 GB of ram, which is important because many budget phones only ship with two GB. This causes stuttering and performance problems when using memory intensive apps like Snapchat and other social media apps.The 3A also comes with 64 GB on internal storage, but with no ability to add expandable storage via a micro SD card. Google has never been a fan of expandable storage, and for some, that may be a deal-breaker depending on your needs. With the affordability of micro SD, it is certainly convenient to be able to add a 128 GB micro SD card to your phone and gain a massive increase in storage. Depending on your needs, however, 64 GB could be plenty and still represents a decent amount of storage of this price point. My needs typically only exceed 64 GB if I am downloading my entire music library from Spotify, or going on a vacation where I expect to take a lot of photos and video.The 5.6 inch HD screen looks great. It doesn’t have the color saturation of a quad HD screen but it still looks great and has a high PPI.I suspect most people wouldn’t really perceive much of a difference between this HD screen when compared to a quad-HD. You can also squeeze the sides of the phone to summon Google Assistant, or more usefully, silence an incoming call. This functionality cannot yet be remapped to other functions, but the ability to rapidly silence an incoming call is pretty cool.The 3A does not support wireless charging, nor is it water resistant, which is not surprising given its price. If I had to choose which flagship features to cut to offer a mid-range phone, those are the two I would choose. Thankfully the 3A retains a headphone jack. I use Bluetooth for calls and music on the move, but when I am listening to music at home I prefer the higher audio quality of a wired headset (streamed music is already highly compressed, and Bluetooth further compresses it.)The 3A’s phone back is plastic rather than glass, but I see that as a positive, not a price concession. An expensive glass phone is appreciated for only a few moments until a smart user immediately puts it into a drop-proof case. I am not a fan of super expensive yet highly fragile flagship phones.Being a Google phone, you are guaranteed three years of Android updates. That is great, but there’s a caveat: I have experienced situations where Android updates degraded performance and eventually crippled a phone. Google’s Nexus 6P started off as an amazing phone, but with each Android update, its performance suffered. I suspect that the underpowered processor of the 6P simply could not keep up with the enhanced demands of each new update. The 6P was sold by Google but manufactured by Huawei. This left me with Google telling me to contact Huawei for support (even though I purchased the phone from Google) and Huawei directing me back to Google. I finally gave up the ghost and just purchased a Samsung. I reference this history for this recommendation: purchase an extended warranty with this phone in case you suffer issues 2-3 years down the road that may crop up as your Android version gets updated.Overall, the 3A represents a great value. You get some great flagship phone features at a price well below $500.",2019年7月18日 在美国审核
Family of Pixel's...,"We have been using Google phones since the Nexus 5 came out and have owned the 5, 5X, 6P, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 3XL and now the Pixel 3a. Needless to say, we love our Google phones. Ease of use is the number one reason why we keep coming back to these phones. Google doesn't load their phones up with all kinds of software that you probably won't ever use. They give you the basic stuff, and they make sure its good. The cameras have always been top notch and this 3a is no exception. I was surprised to see how large the 3a was in comparison to our Pixel 3XL. I have included pictures of the phones side by side. The one that is slightly larger on the left is the 3XL. Not a very big difference in my opinion. They each look so similar to one another that it can be hard to tell them apart. I love that the 3a has built in time lapse. a feature google needs to upgrade and include in its software for all their phones. IT HAS A PHONE JACK. This right here was a huge win. It's so easy to include these on phones, yet most makers are straying away from putting them on phones anymore. It's really nice to have to option, especially for a teenager that needs access to earbuds frequently for school. You don't want them always using expensive wireless earbuds, because they can be easily lost. This simple addition makes this a great choice for many.For the price, you would be hard pressed to find a phone as good as the pixel 3a.

Amazing phone,"This phone is giving flagships a run for their money. I watched a ton of reviews before purchasing (bought in store) Alot of the reviews were saying its cheaper feeling and looking, are way off. the phone looks and feels amazing and there is nothing that says ""im cheap"" the fingerprint sensor is amazing, the responsiveness is that of a flagship phone, and, the camera, blows away all the others. The camera has many features i've yet to see in phones. The images are the best i've ever seen come from a phone. The huge plus for me, was NO GLASS BACK. I absolutely HATE the fact that all the phones have glass backs now. it is insulting. They add something else that will break so you have to buy a new phone. Whatever they can do to get more money from you. All the flagship phones claim ""its for wireless charging"" which is an absolute load of hot steamy dumpster juice. There are many materials out there that allow wireless charging, that dont shatter. lol. I'm blown away by the value of this phone. And it comes with ZERO bloatware which is amazing.

Great Mid-Range Cellphone,"I've been using a refurbished Samsung S5, and it's been limping along with a weak battery and frequent crashes. So I was thrilled to be offered a chance to review this Google Pixel phone. This one was on my shortlist of options when I was ready to upgrade because it had very good reviews, and it seemed like the best mid-range cellphone out there.<br>I have been very pleased with how it has performed. Setting it up was a breeze. It came with a cable that allowed me to transfer my data (including phone contacts) from the Samsung to this one. The instructions are very simple because it's very easy to set up. In fact, this has been the easiest phone to set up of any phone I've ever owned.To complicate things, I was also in the process of changing service providers, so I was nervous that I would have some problems with that. But no. Everything went smoothly with the new provider.Compared to the Samsung S5, the battery capability is 100% better. It holds a charge very well, and when I do charge it, it takes very little time.I'm still exploring the features, but so far I've enjoyed using the camera. It's easy, and the quality far surpasses my previous Samsung. The colors are rich and vivid.I've used Google apps and programs in the past and am quite happy to have a phone that flawlessly works with them. I highly recommend this phone if you're looking for a mid-range android phone.</br>",2019年7月4日 在美国审核
Excellent value for the price,"I've had the Google Pixel 3XL for close to a year and loved it compared to my older Galaxy Note.I had a chance to pick up the Pixel 3a for my wife, and jumped on it.I could do a detailed comparison of specs and materials between the two, but wanted to focus on my wife's experience with it.She's been an iPhone user for years and after dealing with some of the normal GUI issues when switching, she says it's much easier to navigate.Switching over all her data, photos, apps, etc was easy and took very little time when she was able to sit down and use the manual provided.The only negatives in comparison to the XL are a smaller screen (in her case that's a positive actually) and worse battery life.Her phone still can go for more than a day without needing charging and she uses it quite often.The cameras on the 3a are the same as the ones on my XL and the quality appears to be equal - for those that don't know, the Pixel's cameras are among the best out there for cellphones.Google cloud storage is free and unlimited, and she's loving that feature.Even though we got this for free through the Vine program, this phone would be a home run at the retail price of almost half of the XL's.",2019年8月15日 在美国审核

Maybe the best phone on the Plannet (especially for the price),"I love my Pixel 3a. Have been using Android phones since 2012. I have tested an reviewed hundreds of phones. My most recent phone was a Nexus 5x. Positives: #1 Excellent Camera: The photos come out great every time. The double tap power loads quickly and I'm able to get the camera running in time to catch good photos and videos of my kids. It is much faster to load then my Nexus 5x and the pictures are slightly better overall, which is amazing to me as the 5x takes great photos too. I love the Portrait mode photos I've taken. People are amazed and think they were taken on a DSLR camera. Night sight is amazing too, it works really well especially outdoors in the night or in poorly lit rooms. Video is good. The stabilization mode works pretty well. I love the Slow motion with audio and the Time Lapse modes as well. Both work great with kids. My wife was so impressed with the photos and performance of the phone she got one too. #2 Battery: Excellent all Day battery life. I have never seen the battery get below 30% using it all day from 6am to 11pm. Today, I have been using it all day off and on and it's midnight and it's still at 51%. My wife also is very impressed with the battery life. #3 Performance: It's Fast The phone is very fast, it doesn't lag or studder. The only time there is a slight delay in processing is with Night Sight photos. But otherwise it's smooth and quick. I tend to have 10 apps open at one time and quickly switch back and forth between different apps. I will have maps, gmail, calendar, chrome open, with music playing and will quickly switch back and forth between apps without any lag. #4: Size: It feels like a fairly compact phone! I was really concerned that the phone was going to feel huge coming from a Nexus 5x with a 5.1 screen. Because they are using the slim design that Samsung has been using on their S8, S9 and S10 phones it feels surprisingly thin. My Nexus 5x actually feels a little bulky now because it is wider. My wife came from a 4.7 Idol 3 phone and was surprised with how small the phone felt. It's also very light but still feels and looks like the more premium Pixel 3. #5 Support: 3 years of Updates We both love that the phone will continue to get monthly software/security patches and updates for 3 years. No other Android phone can hold a candle to this! Negatives: Only wish we would have bought two of these with the $100 gift card. Otherwise, there are literally no negatives I can think of so far. I'm a very picky person and literally bought and returned 7 laptops on Amazon, Best-Buy &amp; WalMart during the same 2 months I have had my Pixel 3a, because weren't exactly right. I love and would highly recommend the Pixel 3a. I hope that Google makes a 4a and a 5a, if they keep this price/quality point I will be a loyal Google customer for years to come. Overall we (my wife and I) both love the phone and have had no regrets at all with our purchase. I bought mine for $300 on a promotion in May from B&amp;H with 3 months of Mint Mobile Free. But we were fine to pay the full $399 for my wife's phone. Best tech purchase we have made in years.",2019年8月13日 在美国审核
Simply one of the best middle tier phones to get,"I went from a pixel 2xl to a pixel 3a. I was tired of using big devices. I wanted to get a device that had a smaller footprint and also wanted one with a headphone jack. Then, the pixel 3a was announced and caught my attention.I ended up ordering it and so far I've loved it. It's the same experience as all the previous pixel phones. The camera and user experience is the reason I got it.Pros:Same awesome user experience as the previous pixel phones.Amazing camera (same sensor as the pixel 3)Fast charging with the included 18w chargerStereo speakersIt has a headphone jackCons:Not water resistantThe is screen is only 1080p ,but its still greatThe snapdragon processor is definitely noticed when using the phone. The camera takes a bit longer to process the images taken.Overall, this Pixel phone is probably one of the best phones out there in the mid-range price.",2019年11月2日 在美国审核
A Solid Value,"-Pros--Pure Android-Great Battery Life-Clean design; no goofy edges or notches, no giant chin-Great performance-Cons--Weak speakersI was in the market for an efficient, well-designed, pure Android phone without a lot of gee-whiz bells and whistles, and I found exactly what I was looking for with the Pixel 3a XL. It has great performance, at least compared to my previous phone, the galaxy S7 edge, and plenty of storage for my needs at 64 GB. The only real drawback that I've encountered so far is the speakers. The sound is pretty weak, but you can't have everything at this price. I'm more than happy, and I'm very glad to say goodbye to my galaxy.",2019年5月27日 在美国审核
Microphone Didn't Work on Brand New Phone,"I own 3 Google Mini's, a Google Home, and a Chrome-cast, and had just signed up for Google-Fi, so I figured it was time to have a Google phone.It arrived 6/3 and the microphone stopped working 6/4 and am having it refunded on 6/5.I got called from a potential employer twice and they couldn't hear me. They wasted 7 hours of my time.Purchased from the Google store.I had 6 interactions where Google couldn't identify the problem before saying it'd take 2-7 days to ship a replacement.I asked if they could simply overnight it, or give me a two year warranty, or literally anything since they are selling faulty phones. Long story short, it's their 3rd generation of phones and they still can't get it right, and they don't even want to try. I've been Google loyal for 7 years and after they delivered a faulty phone and didn't want to make it right, I'm switching to Apple.",2019年6月5日 在美国审核
Good deal for Android fans,"I really wanted to like the Pixel 3a - it's camera is amazing and truly unique at this price point, but you already knew that. Every reviewer is raving about it, battery life is adequate, screen is amazing and overall experience is quite pleasant. To me, coming from an iPhone 7, it's not much of an upgrade - I can get by with an older camera and LCD display, battery life is on par or better with standby. If you are asking yourself if you want/need this phone then that's the real question. Battery life is decent for Android, which isn't saying much and isn't really a selling point as others have mentioned - this is the phone the Pixel 3 should have been, but with better build quality. And if we're being honest, build quality does factor in, there is nothing sexy about this phone and isn't even understated enough to be charming, it's just bland. I'm not a power user, and will admit I much prefer IOS in favor of stable apps, great standby battery life/optimization, Siri belonging on the short bus, and GASP - iMessage. I applaud Google for such a great effort to bring back the cheap smart phone, I just wish it either tried harder to beat Apple or go their own way, but like most things Google, the end product is merely half baked.",2019年7月15日 在美国审核
GET IT,"Don't waste your money on a $1000 phone, unless you absolutely positively need the specs of a flagship. This phone is perfect for 99% of people (there are even great $300 phones now that would satisfy 75% of people!).Anyway, for the past few years, I've paid cash for my phones and used them on prepaid networks to save money. Pre-Pixel 3a XL I had a Moto G7, which is a good phone on paper, especially for $300, but it was filled with buggy software issues. So I 'splurged' (for me) and got the 3a XL.The biggest standout of this phone is the excellent camera, especially if you like landscape shots (mountains, sunsets, etc). The colors pop just right and the clarity is amazing. It is also a fast camera with no processing lag post-shot. There are some cool features baked into the phone but I think what most people will find great is the cam. The two minor downsides are, there is no micro-SD expansion slot, and the bezels around the screen are big for 2019. I knew that going into it, and neither is a deal breaker for me.Otherwise, the 3a/XL is plenty fast (it actually feels faster than it should - I've read that Google has excellent software optimization). Everything works as it should. Bluetooth connects fast to all my devices.And just to give you an example as to a major benefit of a Google device - if a bug is found, there is a forum to post about it, and the developers post updates on the resolution.I didn't buy this phone from Amazon, but when I find a product or service I feel strongly about, I like to share my experience. I highly recommend anyone looking for a new phone check out the 3a or 3a XL. Even if you think you *need* a Galaxy S10, you probably don't. Check this one out first. Save yourself the $500 and spend it on some other tech toy instead.",2019年6月30日 在美国审核

I go three days without bothering to recharge.The Pixel 3a may not be a flagship model, but it definitely is a sleeper among the best phones on the market.Possibly my favorite aspect of this phone has to be the fact that it doesn't have a notch or holepunch which is the primary reason why I moved away from Samsmug.",2019年12月29日 在美国审核
The iPhone of Android,"Bought it from Google directly because of trade-in. An excellent device.

Google doing what they do best,"I love this Pixel 3a. I've always loved my Chromebook I got for school because unlike a laptop, it never slowed down or caused issues. Google docs was great for changing formats to fit college professors requirements. So anyways, I had been watching the pixel line since they came out a few years ago, and my wife and I finally decided to get these phones from Best buy unlocked and on sale for $299. After 2 weeks I don't think I'll ever go with another phone brand. 3a is the perfect price for someone who doesn't need the best or hottest. But to be honest, this phone does WAY more than I need. Love everything about it. Don't be scared to try switching to a pixel, Google is doing what they do best by catering to simplicity for users while also bring top in the game. My wife was skeptical but now she is also in love with it. Thank you Google for making a cheaper pixel model.

Beautiful little phone,"The only thing missing from the ""Google 3"" to the 3A is the call screener. Which is an amazing tool that I love!Without this feature, you still get an amazing phone.

Once set up it is running the latest Android with very little ""bloat-ware"". 32 Gig of storage for all your apps and photos.I really like this phone. I got my first Google phone earlier this year, and have not looked back since!Whilst this is a slightly lighter version, it is still an outstanding phone.

Fantastic Phone.,"Got the phone approximately 3 weeks ago and all I can say is that it is great. I came from the iPhone but wasn't looking to spend 1k for a phone. Most important things for me were the camera and the battery. I don't care to much for the fastest and newest processor. The phone is fast. The average user won't really notice a difference between the pixel 3a or a flagship phone. At lest not when browsing switching apps or using social media.Battery life of the 3a is great. I get approximately 7 - 7,5 hours of screen on time. Watching YouTube, Facebook, browsing, etc. I'm not huge into gaming so I don't know if that effect s the battery much more. I know there are phones with bigger batteries and longer battery life but I'm also not a huge fan of big phones.Of course nothing is perfect. This is not the best looking phone out there, it doesn't have fancy in display fingerprint reader or a faceID camera. And I wish I had an SD card slot. But that wasn't a deal breaker for me. Everything the phone says it dose it dose very well.I recommend this phone 100% especially for the price. You can't beat it.",2019年8月11日 在美国审核
Best you'll get for your $$,It's a top seller for a reason. Forget Apple. Never cared for or owned any of there products for a number of reasons. If you like to tinker an unlocked Android phone is the one to get and you're just not going to get any more for your money than this. I will say I bought mine new elsewhere and I have never had an issue like this before. I knew it was hardware related. I know my way around an Android in and out. Mine came with a faulty main rear camera. If your Google phone is under warranty they're going to take care of you for free long as it wasn't by fault of the user. Regardless of your experience don't open a phone that's under warranty. They are partners with uBreakiFix and probably others. Take care of your phone and if something goes wrong go to Google phone support online. Just enter your imei number and you'll know if you're in warranty or not and point you in in the right direction. Enjoy your pixel!! ,2020年1月8日 在美国审核

It does everything I need it to (I play very little games, though) -- email, web, text, calls, photos, various apps to organize my life, etc. When I switched to it, I thought it would just be temporarily until I get myself back to a Note that works, but now I don't want to switch!

"Better than an iPhone 6, not better than an iPhone 7 /Samsung S8 or newer","Just to set the record, I do have a Pixel 3a and also have an iPhone XR. Previously had an iPhone 7.Just shooting out a warning here..it is not a better phone than an iPhone 7 . Camera is something, but if you are a previous iphone user or perhaps have something like a 7 7Plus or newer, please don't think you are upgrading. Get it if you broke your phone and need a phone right away, but trust me, camera is not everything. This phone is still a budget phone and works amazingy for anyone who uses budget phones or haven't upgraded to a new phone in 5 years. Works even for those who are looking for a secondary phone , but anyone who have been carrying around an iPhone 7 or a Samsung S8,you gonna start missing out features (taptic engine/notifications/speaker quality etc)that can only be found on premium phones. Also the call quality is just not the best on this and the speakers aren't loud enough, especially in loud environments you may struggle to hear . Again, many people are reviewing a camera here and forget about the phone.<br>Other good features I'd say is recoginzing music playing around you and the always on display, those are nice things beside the camera, but this phone will not replace your iphone 7 or better or Samsung S8/S9 in no circumstances. If you are used to those already with their wireless charging or clarity of the call and many other extra features, you are going to get disappointed.All the other people who stick with budget phones this might do well.</br>",2019年8月6日 在美国审核

"Very nice phone, but needs a better pricing plan","This is a very nice phone with lots of features.Most notable is the quality camera that is used and the flat screen rather than the curved screen on Samsung phones.Also notable is that you are getting pure android and not someone's proprietary apps and bloat.One negative is that it is not the latest greatest processor but rather a upper middle of the road one.The other negatives is the high price to get it unlocked if not activating with a carrier.Why should it cost a hundred dollars more without activation, especially when several places were offering pre-sale gift cards worth 100 dollars.I put the item in my cart which included a 100 Amazon gift card, but when I went to purchase it indicated that the gift-card offer was no longer available.If they sold this for $379 it would be well worth the money but no way is it a $479 (almost 500 phone).",2019年6月6日 在美国审核

No more Google Pixels,"Loved the first one that I got in late 2018, which cost something like $900 through Verizon.Back then, I would have written a 5-star review, much like all the ones that have been posted here.Early in 2020, however, I noticed the aftermarket case would no longer fit correctly on the phone.Finally took the case off and noticed that the battery had been slowly getting bigger, causing the actual plastic phone case to come apart.Will attach pictures after this is posted.Google said that because I called after 12 months, they would not replace the phone.They hooked me up with Asurion insurance, which I apparently had purchased with the phone.Assurion sent me new Google Pixel 3 XL that arrived the next day.That cost me $200, which I guess is like a deductible.Unfortunately, the ringer and call volume on the new phone was extremely low.I could barely hear the ringer, was missing calls,and the call volume was so low and I had to keep telling people to call me on a different phone.There was nothing I could do to get the volume of either up.Best I could do was to put it on speaker phone and then hold it to my ear.All settings and volume sliders were set to maximum.I called Google support.We went through the whole troubleshooting thing, including a factory reset on what was supposed to be a brand new phone.They were unable to come up with a solution and advised me to return the phone to Asurion.Google still would not replace the phone that was only 14 months old, even though battery was in all likelihood failing during the 12-month period.By the way, for those not familiar Google Pixels, the battery cannot be replaced.Contacted Asurion again.They sent me a 3rd Goodle Pixel XL.This one had the exact same problem: even at maximum sound levels, both call and ringer volume were extremely low.Researched it on the internet.Lots of people making the exact same complaint.Google has never responded to the complaints.So I'm returning both of these ""brand new"" phones.Have to wonder whether these were previously returned by other purchasers and ""refurbed"" with the hope that I would settle for a defective phone.For the meantime, I will continue to use the original phone that's coming apart with the slowly exploding battery, at least until I get a new Samsung or perhaps something entirely new.I am completely done with Google Pixel.And another about this phone. I've had better cameras. Although the resolution and clarity is good, portrait pictures get displayed as landscape and vice-versa. If you rotate the phone to try to have the picture fill the screen or be upside up, it immediately auto-rotates to what you don't want. Turning auto-rotate off doesn't help. The image just stays in the wrong view. Clearing the cache doesn't help. Support articles acknowledge the problem and say to change the orientation with the image editor, but there's NO SUCH TOOL in this phone. The only way to fix it is to upload the image to a desktop and change the orientation in gimp or photoshop or whatever image editor you use. Who wants to do that just to change the orientation of an image? Can't believe this phone sells for $1000.",2020年5月7日 在美国审核

Only lasted one year,"The pixel 3a is my fouth android phone.I'm a pretty no-frills phone guy, and I've used some of my past phones for 3-4 years.However, I do need a good camera because we take so many pictures of the kids.So the Pixel 3a seemed like a perfect fit.I was originally very happy with the phone.Good camera, Android OS without bells and whistles, and great battery life.I did miss the Moto actions from last phone which was a Motorola (actions like shaking the phone to turn on the flashlight) but no big deal.And I love the easy integration with Google photos and all other Google products.However, over the course of the year, I noticed three issues:1) CALL QUALITY:call quality and reception seemed worse than my prior phone and certainly worse than my wife's iphone on the same network2) CHARGING PORT: there is a hardware issue with the charging port.It's USB-C and worked fine at first, but then I started having nights where it did not charge.Eventually it stopped charging, and I sent it in to Google.It was still covered by the 1 yr warranty, so they fixed it and sent back.However, the issue started again just a couple of months later3) SCREEN: Just after the 1 yr warranty period, I saw a little cluster of purple spots in the corner of my screen. Over the next two weeks, it expanded to take over the lower 20% of my screen which could be very problematic for some views.Other people online had similar issues and some said it was water damage (my phone has not been in water to my knowledge) and others were as clueless as me.That last issue was the final straw since the phone was very difficult to use.Maybe I got a lemon - I don't know.But I'll likely not buy another Pixel phone",2020年8月25日 在美国审核

Verizon customer - beware,"OK first - the phone is great. We FINALLYgot it working. The 4 Stars is not due to anything wrong with the phone. It's due to the Verizon / Google interface. If you're a Verizon customer, here's what you'll need to know to get it setup:1.It does NOT play well with Verizon out of the box. When we followed the easy prompts to set it up; we kept getting error messages when we got to the 'input carrier' stage.2.We went to Verizon store; they were clueless how to help. When they tried to input into their system, the phone got a 'RED ALERT' error. The guy there said it might be a re-packaged item, which was a joke because its a brand new phone. He said they couldn't touch it.3.It does not come with a physical SIM card, which is confusing. It allows you to download a 'digital SIM', which we only found out aftera long conversation with Amazon tech support, which was very helpful. Except during setup, when downloading the digital SIM card, it again had an error message when we got to the 'input carrier stage'.4. Next step; 2 hours of back and forth chat with Verizon online. the Pixel 3a is not one of their standard supported phones [no reason why]. Finally, they said they would send us a physical SIM card to put in the phone, which they did [for free]. A week later, it arrived.5.Installing SIM seemed promising until it said 'activation failed, please call tech support'. Tech support during pandemic hold msg = 'long wait times due to covid19, blah blah'. So back to Verizon online chat tech support. They were able to figure out activation, after about 30 mins.So the phone is now working, and its great, but if you're a Verizon customer be prepared for some hassle in setup!",2020年6月6日 在美国审核
No more $1000 for the #1 camera in America!,"I already own the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and I'm happy with it, but when I heard about the Google Pixel 3a XL and how it's camera ranked #1 out of all brands. For its camera and price I was taken back by what it can do, especially in the dark. It takes the most beautiful night shots I've seen so far! When comparing the Galaxy S10 plus VS the pixel 3a XL while I was on vacation in the mountains. I'd say landscapes the S10 Plus wins by far! but for night shots I'd have to hand it to the pixel! Also the Samsung galaxy S10+'s rear camera is equipped with a 12mp lens, the Google Pixel 3a XL rear camera is equipped with a 12.2mp lens. The Google Pixel fares slightly higher, but the Galaxy S10 plus has some very impressive technology at your disposal with 3 rear lenses and 2 front with camera and built-in advise to give you the very best shot possible. So who wins? Technology wise, the S10 Plus by far. But for the pixel having only a single lens to do it all? I'd have to hand it to the pixel overall. It already beat apples newest model iPhone 11 for night shots. So if your trying to decide on what model to go with?

"Ok, But Very Different Than What You're Used To","Ive had this phone for several days and so far I'm pretty underwhelmed with it. I've had many other phones in the past ranging from several Samsung's, LG, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, etc. I also own tablets, an iPad, and a Mac. The 3a is the first phone in roughly ten years that has made me miss the usability of my old phone. So far here's my take:PROs:Camera - is very good, although zooming is harder than on other phones I've used. The night sight option is excellent, wish all phones had this. Great resolution.Speed - is excellent, no issues loading websites, tasks, or streaming video (but of course nearly any new phone would be doing this)Processor Specs - this phone is pretty fast and should be up to date for a long time, possibly faster &amp; better than other phones in or under it's price range.Form and Fit - fits nicely in hand with lots of cases availableFingerprint Reader - works nearly everytime and better than my last phoneGoogle Assistant - haven't used it much but supposed to be awesome. Perhaps not a big deal as any Android phone can access Hello Google etc and then you ask it a question like the weather or traffic. I realize the Google Assistant does a few other things but I don't see this as deal breaker to own the phone over. Nice to have though.CONs:Overall usability - UI (user interface)is far behind other manufacturers in my opinion. This is like Google's version of the iPhone, you can't customize the home screen very much, you CANNOT control icon size on your home screen nor decide if you want rows of 4 icons. You are locked into 5 tiny icons on your home screen in each row (I checked with Google and you cannot change this!). I have found this adds lots of eye fatigue whereas this can be customized to your heart's content on Samsung, LG, etcSearch Bar - it's permanently mounted on the Bottom of Home screen whether you like it or not. You can't move or remove it. Which is odd because this is where ALL other phone companies put your icons for Calling, Texting, Contacts, etc. Get used to seeing the Google search bar there (and for Google Assistant), obviously Google wants to push this design on you.Pure Android experience - Maybe, but it's Google's rules. Very very different in settings and other features in the Android build. You can customize some stuff, other important stuff like icon size and moving the dumb search bar from the homescreen you are stuck with.On/Off buttons - Are crammed right next to the volume, I'm constantly shutting off the screen when I just want to raise volume, bad design.Battery Life - Just average, was expecting more. My last phone by LG had the battery life beat by a mile compared to the Pixel 3a. Isn't battery technology better? Odd the Pixel will drain a brand new battery with very light use in 24 hours.Tray Notifications - at top of screen and absolutely TINY. Can't customize this as far as I know. Can barely see the notifications for gmail, YouTube, Calendar. It's just not that friendly. Much less user friendly than the last two phones I've owned.No SD Card for upgrading - that means you'll rely on Google to backup all your photos &amp; videos. Is it just me or am I the only person that doesn't want Google having every single photo I ever take on their servers? If you use your phone to take videos and want to edit them, lack of an SD card makes it much harder to move that video to your computer for editing.Gmail App - Not as nice looking as the ones on my last phones, a little harder to switch accounts. Much preferred the one in my Samsung and LG.Conclusion: This is a great fast phone with awesome camera. but it has serious limitations. If it wasn't for the camera I'd replace it tomorrow with something else. The homescreen is a real drag not being able to enlarge icons or have them 4 to a row instead of the required 5.I realize you can install 3rd party launchers to do this for you, but why have to do that on a new cutting edge phone? I mean it's really a bummer and the biggest issue I'm having. Plus, in a couple years if the phone slows down, the launcher may need to be uninstalled to free-up resources.This might be the phone for you if you don't mind being locked into Google's Sandbox, but I would say wherever you buy it make sure there is a return policy in case it's not for you.

Google Pixel 3a xl-Fatally flawed,"Just received my 3rd Pixel 3a xl in 10 months.Both lasted 4-5 before the exact same problems arose.One day,speakerphone stopped,phone ringer stopped,alarms silent.How can you use a phone that doesn't ring when someone calls?Google could care less,making you jump through hoop after hoop to return.Then,if you live long enough,they send you a refurbished phone to replace the NEW one that you paid for.Google lost a large class action suit on the previous version of this phone,the Pixel 2,and then bring to market a product with the same EXACT issues.In my opinion you'd be better served using a cans with a wire between them.",2020年5月8日 在美国审核
Brilliant phone,"I bought a Sony xperia xz. Reason for that is that the cost was low and Sony generally makes good stuff. But I usually do this mental calculation when it comes to buying some items. Cost is too high, skip it. Cost is too low, it's cheap for a reason. I judge paying more than a few hundred dollars for a phone to be daft. So wrong about that, I know now.I had the chance to get the pixel 3a xl. What a difference it makes. The camera feels like it is about 3 decades of technology better. The night sight is great, but the overall clarity of the picture is far superior.The screen size and quality is also infinitely better. I like the size of it too, as I have big hands. But watching a movie on the phone is generally a better experience.Also, the finger print reader is so easy to use and versatile, I find I can use it with different functions and it is very sensitive.I have been footering about with this edge sense thingy and can't quite work out why I need that. But this is new to me so perhaps i will get used to it. Right now, using it to active google voice search isnt something i do a lot of.I'm not sure if I will ever need 64gb of memory but I see it is not expandable. Personally I do not see that as an issue because I don't need that many apps, and it is a Google phone so you get access to online storage.Really though, the point of this is that I have noticed a vast difference in quality that I feel justifies the difference in the price.Update**I'm loving this battery. It charges really fast and drains very slowly. Well played Google!Also, I found this function where the phone picks up music playing nearby and tells you what song it is. I don't know that's a big thing for me but I have it and find that I like playing with it. Just wanted to tell you about it too.Update***I have been messing around with the camera and a tripod. Mainly I wanted to try the astrophotography thingy. This is the result. A picture taken in PA around 6 at night when it was really dark. I thought it worked out really well.The second photo was taken during the action ina New Hope. It's the bit where the stormtroopers forgot to tell Skywalker they had the high ground.Anyway, you get the idea. The camera is really good.",2019年10月19日 在美国审核
ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"This phone is the worst Google phone Google has marketed.I had a Pixel 2, which made me fall in love with the Google phones.When it came time for a replacement, I walked in to the store already knowing I wanted a Pixel.What a mistake that was.From day one, I cannot get internet 80% of the time unless I am connected to WiFi.If I do attempt to research something when not connected to WiFi, the phone freezes and after a few minutes it reads ""App Not Responding.Quit App?""Another huge malfunction is that when I tap on a text to read it, it deletes the text.NO I AM NOT SWIPING BY ACCIDENT.This happens half of the time.I am afraid to attempt to read a text in fear it will erase.Now for the final malfunction, the alarm clock does not work.I hae set three alarms for each day and none of them function.I researched this problem and Google is aware of it.Really?So think hard before you buy this phone, don't say you weren't warned.",2020年10月19日 在美国审核

Absolutely love this phone!,"Pro's: price, camera, latest android OS system with all the latest upgrades immediately.<br>Con's: sometimes, on rare occasions its buggy and will act strange, but if you do a restart, its great for another month.I've been using this phone for well over a year!For the most part I give it an A+. Why anyone would pay $500-900 for a phone I just don't get when you can get this for half!The camera just kills it. Everyone wants to use my camera vs. their Apples LOL.The night vision is just amazing. It's true, it takes amazing pictures, no lag, no blur, just great pictures.The screen is bright and give great colors day or night!The best feature is you have immediate Google OS updates. My wife's LG is still on Android 8, my 3a XL is on 11! Plus you don't have an overlay over the OS from the phone maker to run their skin. If there is a bug, it gets fixed fast and I can download the upgrade immediately!Battery life is great, well over a day on a single charge, sometimes it will go into the following day to noon. It also has headphone jack which I need for phone calls and to mute the sound and listen to great music.Now my wifes LG is giving her problems so I ordered form this link another 3a XL.It's coming today!!!!</br>",2021年2月10日 在美国审核
Battery life sucks!,I'm pretty disappointed in this phone. I had to replace my Moto from a couple of years ago since we all know that smart phones generally have about a two year life before they start going bad on us. Battery life is my number 2 priority when shopping for a phone. This battery sucks. I'm so beyond disappointed. The store I purchased this from has a $50 restock fee and I've already paid hundreds of dollars. Overnight while having no background programs open it went from 100% to 97%. This morning while listening to YouTube for 30 minutes it went from 97% to 86%. As a professional photographer I couldn't care less about the camera. I don't appreciate the forced Google bar and the forced clock/weather whatever they call it. It's right on the home page where I would prefer to put apps I like better. The whole reason I don't use iPhone is because of forced app placement. I don't like the swipe up action that I have to do to go back to previous pages or to clear out background apps. As I feel stuck with this phone it's going to be a long two years.,2019年8月9日 在美国审核

Not a great replacement for a flagship phone,"Pros:- nice back-facing camera.Cons:- front camera is off to the side, which makes your selfies look like you're looking off to a side a little bit or slightly cross-eyed.- battery life is below expectations. With frequent usage, it will run out before nighttime unless you recharge it halfway through the day (not an issue with my previous android phones or iphone X).- screen is not very bright. i have to turn it up almost all the way to get a decent view.- will experience noticeable lag in modern, even basic 3d games.- not sure if this is an android-specific thing or just the Pixel, but the Maps loses GPS connection when you turn off the screen, which makes it really hard to navigate if you're biking and listening to instructions via earbuds, for isntance.- some apps lag and pretty buggy overall, and don't start up or take a long time to start up in general, at least much more frequently than my previous phones, but again I'm not sure if this is android-specific or just pixel.",2019年7月18日 在美国审核
"Had it 2 or 3 weeks, will keep updating this review.","Replaced a POS Moto G5 with this.Phone is nice, a little bigger than I like, but not big compared to most of today's phones.Had an interesting time transferring photos from my PC to this phone.I found that if I copied into an empty folder on the phone, it worked fine.If it ever gave me a message about skip or replace, regardless of the answer when it was done ""copying"" no new files were on the phone.Google assistant was not as easy as it should have been to disable and then the phone kept asking me to re-enable it.So I got rid of Pixel menu and Google assistant and went back to Evie.The hardware volume control is worthless as it only adjusts one of the volumes.For some reason the notification volume is linked to the ringer volume so I had to install a 3rd party app to separate those.The built in ringtones were too quiet for me so I downloaded a really loud one from Zedge.I love the built in call screener.Have not had much to do with the camera yet, they say its really good.I would rather the fingerprint scanner be on the front.Will write more later.Update 7/17 I like the phone.The speaker phone fidelity is terrible.Still haven't done much with the camera. (My previous POS phone got me out of the habit of taking pics). That's the only negative (the fidelity). All in all, I'll get another one of these for the wife.Update 7/28 the only two problems, one small one large.Small: whenever you adjust the ringer volume it has to play a sample.I turn the ringer volume down when I go to bed. Would like to turn it up when I awake but can't because it blasts out 3 seconds of the loud ringer and Don't want to wake others.Would like to be able to adjust the ringer slide without audio confirmation.Second problem, big, people that I call have trouble understanding me and me them.",2019年7月8日 在美国审核

Decent phone but not outstanding,"I bought my pixel 3a at a T-Mobile store, a d not on Amazon. I have had it now a few months, and think that I can now give a good opinion of how I feel about it. The sound quality is just decent. The speakers are not as loud as people make them sound to be. The fingerprint reader is decent. I'm coming from an honor 6X, which has just as fast a fingerprint reader as the 3a does. The quality of the screen is good. You can see it in sunlight, but it's not very clear. The battery life is just average. I don't play games on my phone, and compared to my honor 6X which I could go a full day, almost a day-and-a-half I barely get three-quarters of a day with the 3A. I was an AT&amp;t prepaid user, now I'm with T-Mobile. Because of the phone I have Wi-Fi calling and voice over LTE. The reception has been pretty good in most places. I have not used to mobile hotspot yet, but I have the ability to do it using the T-Mobile plan that I have.

Also create widgets that when you press on them dial the number that is programmed with that particular widget.2. I could find no detailed manual that describes many of the capabilities and how to set them up.3. There is no way to set up the phone to answer automatically after a particular number of rings. You have to physically touch the phone to answer. For those of us who wear Bluetooth headsets, and especially hearing aids with Bluetooth, this is a great feature. I just discovered that I can take calls by simply pressing on the Bluetooth.4. There does not seem to be any way to adjust the sensitivity when touching the screen.

When I try to send someone a video they receive it as just a still picture, so have to figure out why. But the camera is SO much better, and gives you tips for a better picture which is nice.I am disappointed in the battery life though. Even though both phones have the same size battery the reviews on this one was that it lasted longer, etc. I actually think it doesn't. I do NO gaming or watching videos/movies on it, and it seldom lasts me a full day which is definitely a dissappointment.Fortunately it has a fast charge (but so did the moto) so that helps, but still can be problematic, especially when traveling.Update....while traveling and taking photos the battery went from 100 to 17%in less than 2 hrs!Luckily I was prepared and had a power bank with me (Zendure Power Bank Supermini 10,000mAh USB-C 18W PD Portable Charger). It had me back fully charged in 30 min and I was good to go again, but still 2 hrs is WAY to short I bought the phone primarily for the photo quality.

The Pixel 3a is a good choice for photo and video users,"Is this Pixel 3a better than a $130 phone? I bought an Amazon Prime Moto X4 for $130 a month before I received this Pixel 3a which had a suggested retail around $400. The Pixel 3a is better in two areas: 1) camera and 2) screen display quality. Otherwise they feel exactly the same to me in speed and function.The camera is good a focusing and captures a lot of detail and colors, more than a lower-priced phone. Faces have more levels of detail and range of colors. The low light Night Sight is a big help. Photo Sphere is a fun feature. It's lacking in a good way to take vertical panoramas. Overall though a step up from your under $200 phone cameras. If you are a photo enthusiast then this is a good feature.The screen quality is amazing. So much depth of color a detail. Lower priced phone screens tend to have less detail and are have too much contrast. They lose detail in the highlights and shadows. But high resolution video looks amazing. So if you watch a lot of movies or video this is a big plus. But if you don't I'm not sure if this is worth the extra cost.The Pixel 3a is made of a glossy plastic. I prefer this over glass and metal constructed phones. The Pixel 3a is lighter in weight which is a priority for me. This phone is narrower than the Moto X4. This is helpful for those who like to hold and text with one hand for example. But I prefer the Moto X4's wider screen. This has a headphone jack which could be useful. It cannot charge wirelessly which is a negative. Battery life is decent, but the Moto X4's is excellent.So this phone is well suited for people who like taking photos and watching video on their phone. A great set of features if you don't want to spend $1,000 on a phone. If you are only using the phone for talking/texting and using utility apps like maps, then I don't think the Pixel 3a is necessary, and a $100-$200 is fine.",2019年7月19日 在美国审核
"It's a great phone, period.","I have had this phone a couple of weeks and it is great. Easily the best cell phone I have ever had, and Android 10 is really cool. Battery is good, charges quickly, very nice screen, super camera, vast selection of apps in the Play Store, the Internet page loading is really quick (at least compared to my old phone). It does not have cordless charging, and is not waterproof if you drop it in the toilet, but if you can live with that I would say that functionally it is as good or better than my wife's iPhone, for a lot less money. With the large screen size it is fine for watching videos, Amazon TV, or use as a Kindle reader, or for navigation, and the volume is loud enough to listen to podcasts in bed without an external speaker, though you can use one if you want.Nice job, Google.",2019年12月14日 在美国审核

An Overrated Phone,"A very good camera coupled with an erraticly sensitive screen.<br>I've had this for over a year now and I've taken really nice pictures with this thing.Excellent in low light, crisp otherwise too.But when not using the camera, the screen shows an astonishing tendency to misread or fail to read my touches, keystrokes, and any other contact.The thing turns on in my pocket when supposedly locked.In this regard, it's the worst phone I've ever had (and I've had three generations of Galaxy S models, a couple Motorolas, an HTC, and a few others).A major disappointment.I wouldn't recommend and I won't endure another Pixel.</br>",2020年3月7日 在美国审核
Best camera out there....BUT...,"I have always been a Galaxy fan, but when I took pictures on this phone, they blew the Samsungs out of the water! Wow, all photos are just impressive and the night sight is fantastic. The phone is easy to use, clear and concise colors and if you just want a good camera, this is definitely your phone! Now the bad....the video quality. Come on Google, get with the times!All of these pixel phones including the 4, only have video at 30 fps. I took an indoor video of my kid's sports game with the stabilization and it was still blurry in a lot of spots. I've read other reviews where it is supposed to switch to 60 fps and it will look better with full sunlight, but for indoor videos, these Pixels fail in quality. If you're looking for a perfect camera, then this is your phone. If you are a mom like me who takes lots of videos of your kids, your trips, outings, etc., you should look at something else for a phone. If this phone had strictly 60 fps for videos, I wouldn't hesitate to buy. Google needs to step it up in order to be competitive with video taking. 30 fps is severely lacking in comparison to just about every other phone out there.",2019年11月21日 在美国审核
Total BS,"Whomever has written reviews saying that ""this is a great phone"", has NEVER owned another phone ever in their life. Battery is deplorable! Why? the screen, unless at 100% brightness, is dull and dim. So, if you want to see a beautiful screen, you have to max it. When you max it, and use the phone normally, it will drain quickly. If you use it aggressively, and MANY people use their phones a lot throughout their day, the battery will be gone way before the end of any business day. You can barely hear notifications when they come through. Speakers, though dual, are not loud at all. I have had phones with single speakers that were WAY louder. And honestly, at the end of the day, most phones for a long time now have been made with bigger, easier to read screens. This phone in person is incredibly small. It is a ridiculous, unrealistic, very old school size. Like when phones were first released size. There is more than can undoubtedly prove that it is nowhere near worthy of purchasing, but I hope I have said enough here to prove that your money can be undoubtedly better spent elsewhere.",2020年5月17日 在美国审核

Great phone for the price,I would highly recommend the Pixel 3a and these are my pros and cons and I also put alot of photos I took on my Pixel 3aPros1. Camera- the camera is amazing for the price seriously there's no other camera that can beat it for the price on an Android2.Pure Android- there's no bloatware it's not loaded with a bunch of apps you don't need your getting Android in it's purest form3.Updates- your guaranteed three years of major updates4. Great Battery- the battery on this phone is great and last all day and if you do use it up quick there's a 18 watt fast charger in the box and it definitely comes in handy when it's neededCons1. No Water Resistance-it has no IP rating but if your careful I think you'll be fine and there's ways to get around it I went to an amusement park and got on the water rides because I bought a clear water resistant pouch and it did it's job completely and I was still able to take pics threw the pouch2. Not the latest processor-but for $400 it's forgivable and it does everything I need it's just slow on certain gamesThat's it honestly the pros outweigh the cons but if your a heavy gamer I would get a phone with a really good processor but that will cost you alot more just keep that in mind,2020年7月19日 在美国审核

Good tablet but bad phone,"So this phone is poorly designed to be used as a phone.The sensor that turns off the touch screen is still in the top left hand corner, so if you are right handed with anything less than a flat face the phone will not turn the screen black while you are talking on the phone and you will find yourself muting yourself or putting people on speaker while on the phone.Furthermore most controls are sill set up for smaller phones with the back controls in the top left hand corner or bottom left which is not convenient for a right handed person unless you plan on using two hands at all time.Also the squeeze function only happens when you are trying to hold the phone by the base in portrait mode and stops whatever video you have playing.This phone is utterly frustrating.That being said it is quick, and the camera is great.You can get these for like $200 on ebay, which makes them possibly worth the total faults embedded into them.",2019年12月10日 在美国审核

Consider something else,"I've had this phone for a year now and have had many android phones, so I feel fairly qualified to write an opinion based on actual experience. I'll keep it short.1. Battery life is lowsy. I use this phone for work, so I'm not watching videos all day on full brightness. Even after putting everything on Dark mode &amp; low brightness, I can lose 25%-35% of the battery power in an hour just answering emails, making phone calls, and browsing the web.2. Needs more Ram.Google cheaped out on the Ram with this one. Constantly running sluggish, with constant text, email, &amp; web browser issues. Frequently restarting the phone &amp; clearing program cache's, which helps short term but not a long term solution.3. Software: Pretty good overall, but affected deeply by lack of ram &amp; system resource management. Sometimes when selecting a recipient from my contacts to send a text to, it'll take 20-30 seconds just to pull up the text program so I can start sending a text.4. Camera: the bright spot with this phone.It's really, really good.5. Value: When google will give you $300 for something you paid $1,000 for a few months earlier, they know what their product is really worth.6. Other: I like the ""android lite"" approach which is why I bought this phone in the first place.Anything Samsung makes (with similar specs) is more capable than this phone, but you're bogged down with Bixby and Bloatware.Auto backup for google photos is great! Being able to text from a web browser in a google-supported environment is a fantastic [free] feature. Previously had a MightyText subscription with great success.At this point I feel like waiting for a Pixel 5 and hope Google ups their game, but their history of acquiring patents and buying out companies has killed off products or relegated them to lose ground to manufacturers that know how to produce a quality product of their own.",2020年2月13日 在美国审核
Serious Issues with the Display,"I would like to preface this review by saying without these problems, I would be happy to review the phone as 4-5 stars. However, this has been rather aggravating.For transparency, I bought this phone lightly used in November 2019, but there were no issues, physical or internal, that were reported or that I have seen. It was essentially a new phone, making this all the more confusing.I was walking in my hardwood floor dining room when a bump into my father caused me to drop the phone. I wasn't concerned since I had a case and screen protector on and it only fell from a little higher than waste height. I picked up the phone and it had no physical damage whatsoever, as expected. However, it wouldn't turn on. The phone still worked (it vibrated and played audio when using the voice assistant), but the display wouldn't turn on. I worked the next two days all day, so I wasn't able to get it into a repair store either day.I had to go out of my way the third day to a trusted repair store, and they told me the problem was simple: the cord for the display has an odd shaped end, which makes it very easy for it to fall out of the port it should be in (or something along those lines, I'm no expert - which is also the reason why I wouldn't ever dare open the phone up and try to fix it myself). They were kind enough to only charge me $20 for the consultation and repair, but that is two and a half phone-less days and $20 for an issue which is apparently common.Fast forward just one month. I am sitting at a restaurant with a friend, phone on my leg. Maybe not the safest place for the phone, but it was only about 2 feet off the ground, so I wasn't worried. I should have been. It slid off of my leg and lightly fell on the ground. It fell on the back of the case, though, so I wasn't worried about the screen. Pick up the phone and... de-ja-vu, it isn't turning on.The first occurrence of this issue was poorly timed with work, but it was during my winter break (Sophomore in college). The second time luckily happened on a Saturday, so I was able to bring it in the next day, but if it happened on a Monday? Goodbye, Pixel, for the week. As a college student, I am not made of time or money. I can't keep interrupting my days and dropping $20 every time my phone falls from more than 12 inches high.Like I said, I like everything else about this phone: the camera, speaker, battery life (!), and the price (when buying used). But if this keeps happening, I may need to start searching for a different phone.",2020年1月27日 在美国审核
Google Won't Support Pixel 3 It cannot actually be repaired DO NOT BUY A PIXEL,"I bought the original Pixel and owned it for about 13 months. It broke the screen when in an off road auto ride. So I called Google to have the screen repaired and explained it wasn't a Warranty Claim. They said they couldn't do a repair and referred me to an outfit in England who would. So I called England. They said they couldn't repair it either because the phone couldn't be repaired at all. Naturally, I asked why. Well, Google made the dumbest engineering mistake in the history of telephones. All of the phone's electronics are embedded in the glass screen. So if you damage the screen, you now own a handsome door stop. So if the 3A is built the same way (and I believe it is) just be certain you ask if it's built like the Pixel 3. If it is, be aware you can never drop or damage it in any way.",2019年8月21日 在美国审核

Flawed Phone – It Can’t Handle the Fundamentals,"I was switching from an iPhone 6 (all I’ve owned is iPhones), and I really wanted to love the Pixel 3a and the notion of a pure Android experience. And some things were really slick. But this phone is fundamentally flawed. The Pixel 3a fails at a couple critical things every phone can do (even my old iPhone).(1) Creates a really inconsistent / wonky connection with Honda Bluetooth systems, making it unusable. [Google’s suggestion was that I should sell my couple-year-old Honda and buy a new car with Android Auto. Thanks… that’s helpful…](2) Doesn’t switch to cellular data backup when the internet connection coming through WiFi is weak / not functioning.[Tested on multiple WiFi networks, side-by-side with an iPhone that had no issues.]I spent no less than 3 days and 5 hours on the phone with Google trying everything and resetting the phone. Google eventually took it back. In the process, Google dragged its feet on responding to me until my trade-in phone had been irretrievably lost in their system, and now they’re refusing to give me market value for my phone.

Heed my warning: DO NOT GET A GOOGLE PHONE!,"I have never been more disappointed with a phone more quickly than I have been with my Google phone. The battery barely lasts a day and the charging cord is insultingly short. What is worse, the internal memory is easily maxed out and you will likely find yourself having to totally rely on Google Drive. For this reason and others, the phone is a major data hog and you will blow through your data even faster than before.However, perhaps the worst and most unforgivable thing about owning a Google phone is that Google flat out lies to customers about the amount of Google Drive storage they will provide phone owners. They make it sound like it’s unlimited and like it won’t affect your non-phone related Google Drive storage. Neither of these pieces of false advertising is true.In the effort to receive satisfaction for the extreme deficiencies of my Google phone, I have also had the great displeasure of dealing with Google’s customer service. It might as well be nonexistent. I can say without a shred of exaggeration that it is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. They will not respond to any real issues with their products.In short, it’s no surprise that Google has had class action lawsuits brought against them for the false advertising around their phones.

Horrible phone with chronic issues Google won't fix,"I have had this Pixel 3a for 6 weeks. It's never been dropped or abused in any way. One day talking on the speaker phone it made a crackle noise and the speaker phone function went out. The next day as a text came in same thing - crackle and then notification sounds went out. When that happened, lost all notification sounds for phone ring, alarm, text notifications, calendar reminders etc. Googled the problem to find out this is NOT a unique issue with the Pixel 3a or even to Pixel phones in general. In fact, Google support has an entire section dedicated to ""sound issues"" with the Pixel.After hours on the phone with Google support and my provider and multiple trouble shooting steps and factory resets, the solution is to send it in for warranty repair. Oh, and by the way, if they can't fix it they will send me a refurbished phone. So for a phone I have had less then 2 months that is obviously defective and I have only made 1 payment on, I don't get a new replacement. And if it's not fixable I get someone elses problem phone.

"Fragile, poorly designed fase and case makes for a crack-prone phone, repair process is terrible.","This phone is SO DELICATE - the face will crack if you look at it the wrong way, no dropping even necessary.The glass screen seems to ""flex"" around the plastic case, and I have had two hairline fractures in my display within less than 6 months of owning the phone (the second occurred just days after I got the first one repaired, from being in my handbag, not dropped).Also when the screen cracked the first time, the phone stopped working altogether -- usually you can still operate the phone with a crack, but not this phone.WORST is the repair process -- you have to FedEx your phone to Google, which will repair and send it back to you in 7-10 days!You can only have the phone repaired in-store if you live near the handful of stores authorized to repair the pixel.I live in San Francisco, and the nearest store is an hour drive away (and I don't have a car).Finally, you cannot TALK to anyone on the phone about your repair - they send you an email saying what it will cost to fix it.I wanted to contest the $140 repair cost because I see this crack as being a product design defect -- not may fault -- and I don't think I should have to pay for it.After about 30 minutes talking and waiting for a customer service rep to help me, his only response it that they can't do anything to modify the repair work authorization to reduce or waive the repair fee on the phone, you can only communicate via email (which is limited to, accept or reject the repair charge).The battery is also not good, barely lasted a day with normal usage (and I am a light user - I don't stream video or music much at all, and mostly use my phone for texting, email, and playing stored music, not streaming).In short -- the cost savings for this phone are NOT worth it.I have never experienced a cell phone that cracked so easily in my entire life, and that is so arduous to repair.The first repair took the full 10 days -- so I had to use an old, barely functioning phone during that one.I'm still waiting for the current repair ORDER to process and I sent it to google 4 days ago!I hate being captured by Apple, but the iphones I've had over the past decade proved way superior in terms of durability and repairability.",2019年10月18日 在美国审核

For $278 sale price it's all the money,"Having now switched to this Android phone after 10 years using an iPhone, here's what 6 weeks of use has revealed: 1) Android operation still has a way to go before it becomes as simple &amp; intuitive as IOS.

I can get through the day with a light combo of surfing, email, messaging, &amp; a few calls. 3) The battery does charge from about 20% to full fairly fast. 4) Included options for customizing screens &amp; sounds are very limited. 5) The camera does not impress me. Yes, it can shoot in very low light, but every image, regardless of lighting, is way oversaturated. The programmed photo processing also oversells noise reduction which makes images look over-sharpened to the point of looking gritty and with jagged edges. 6) The screen is pretty good--video &amp; still images look fluid with above average color fidelity. 7) The tiny speakers are as worthless as every other speaker on any other phone. 8) The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the top of the phone; audio quality is good. 9) Screen size is a bit smaller than the iPhone 11. 10) Build quality is good, but does not approach what Apple accomplished with the iPhone 5S. Shame on them for leaving that design theme. 11) Screen touch sensitivity is a little too good. Sliding this phone into pockets, then moving around, has resulted in several instances of various Google pages loading up. 12) Contrary to Google's ""Look How Easy It Is To Set-Up"" teaser on their website, it would not allow a single transfer from my iPhone. Conclusion: It's worth the $278 sale price, but it's not the bargain miracle all the (paid) reviews claim.",2020年7月6日 在美国审核

"Flimsy phone, terrible customer service","This phone stopped working three weeks after purchase when my wife took it hiking.

This phone was never in water, never splashed, etc. My wife is active, but any phone that stops working because someone has damp or slightly sweaty hands is a joke. They wanted to send me a refurbished phone for $20 less than I paid for the same phone brand new only a few weeks before.

I googled it and it is apparently a known hardware problem. (I recommend looking it up before purchasing the phone). I contacted support who told me I'm SOL because the warranty is expired. So if you want to spend a ton of money on a phone that may have an unusable camera in a year or less then go for it. As for me I'm never getting a Google device again.,2020年1月1日 在美国审核

Speakers and Battery life issue,I am fed up with the hardware of this Google phone. Every time I am facing newer issues with some old once. New issue is with speakers. I can not use speakers while talking on any phone calls like normal phone call or Whatsapp audio call. I can not video call without headphones because of the speaker. I can listen music with loudspeaker but not calls. And the same issue with battery again. Battery drained too fast. Unexpected very low battery performance.,2019年11月19日 在美国审核

This Camera Is Amazing!!,"I bought this phone as an alternative to buying a 300$ camera for more ease of portability and holy cow are the results astonishing.<br>The tracking autofocus allows me to snap shots in mere seconds and a few of those examples I posted here.<br>The portraits although a tad bit too cropped in for my liking, are perfectly fine and have tons of dynamic range!What makes the portraits even better is the option to adjust the amount of background blur after the shots taken!Night sight is like magic and also has the same tracking auto focus like the main camera mode.With night sights software combined with that tracking autofocus I'm usually always 100% confident I can get a good photo.As for everything else the battery life is great even when I record video in 4k for periods at a time.Speaking of the video, I like how flat it is and how almost true to life the colors are it gives me more room for post production if need be. Video quality is tack sharp on the main camera.I'm not too concerned about it not having 4k 60fps mainly because I just use 30fps anyway but in the next model like the Pixel4a I would at least like the option available to me.One thing I have to note is the charging speed. The charging speed is very fast! Probably the fastest charging smartphone I've ever used.That pretty much wraps up my experience with this device. I think it's a great option for anyone if they wan't a break from the flagship price but still want an amazing camera with great battery life, and even better software!Don't let that snapdragon670 scare you, Google's software makes the experience very smooth and performance will always be good.Keep it up Google!</br></br>",2019年8月15日 在美国审核

"$399 - good, $299 (or less) - GREAT!","Bought this a week before Christmas which it was on sale for $279.99 and already used it for a month. In my opinion, the original $399 price tag is still a bit pricey compared to what other brands (Xiaomi, Oppo, Huawei, Pocophone, Vivo &amp; Realme) offers, especially when you talk about the hardware specs and build quality.<br>Now, about the Pixel 3a:1) BatteryIt lasts me for 20-26 hours depending on my usage and it gives me an average of 5 hours of Screen On Time (monitored for 12 days with my typical use). I don't really use my phone when I'm out and about, but when I'm at home it does fall short of the 20 hours mark due to my YouTube binge watching. With that said I'm expecting more out if this because with my previous phone which is an Sony Xperia XA1 with an 2300mAh battery, the Pixel 3a just last 2-4 hours more of usage compared to the Xperia XA1. Yes, the Xperia XA1 may have an 720p IPS screen which may helped consume less battery but I think that the Pixel 3a should last me a 24-30 hours (or maybe a bit more) with an 6-8 hours of Screen On Time consistently for my usage, but for some reason it just can't. The thing that I dislike the most with the Pixel 3a is the battery drain while the phone is in idle, it seems to consume between 5-10% in just an hour idling. I disabled Digital Well-being because I don't really need it and I think it will help consume less battery in the background, which I think it did. I also restricted a lot of apps that I don't need running on the background.NOTE: I've attached a screenshot of my typical device usage.2) Fingerprint ReaderIt reads kinda slow and when I put the phone inside the front pocket of my jeans (fingerprint reader facing my thigh) without a case, the fingerprint reader gets some misfires which makes the phone lock and ask for my pin when I about to use the phone out of my pocket. Obviously, putting a case on it helped this cease. I don't know if this is a thing with phones with a fingerprint reader on the back or its just with the Pixel 3a or maybe it's just my jeans.3) CameraAs the majority says, it is amazing with photos especially with the Night Sight and Astral Photography Modes (Astral Photography is available on Android 10 and can be used while in Night Sight Mode and propping the phone still). Portrait Mode is great for a one (1) lens-only system but it misses some edges or gaps 20% of the time, also RAW (DNG) is not available when shooting on Portrait Mode. Top Shot/Motion is handy when you didn't got the timing of your shot right and it does work on both front and back of the camera. Setting it on auto doesn't active at times, that's why I set mine always on. Having it on in a picture do use more storage space. The caveat here is it only saves the other shots on low resolution (around 0.8 MP), the original shot is the only one saved on full resolution.Video quality it is good, stabilization is great in 1080p and good in 4K while audio quality is good enough. The back camera can shot in 4K at 30 FPS and 1080p at 30 or 60 FPS while the front camera can only 1080p at 30 FPS. It can also take slow motions but only on the back camera either in 1080p at 120 FPS (1/4 speed) or in 720p at 240 FPS (1/8 speed).NOTE: I've attached some of my sample pictures. The coffee mug shot was taken on Portrait Mode. The cruise ship shot was taken on Camera/Normal Mode with HDR+. The moon shot was taken on the Night Sight/Astral Photography Mode. The yellow wall and night sky shots are RAW (DNG) pictures then edited using Snapseed.4) StorageHope that they offered it with 128 GB (or maybe 256 GB) of storage because why not. I already used 45 GB within a month which indicates a monthly off load of files to my external hard drive.5) ScreenIt is an OLED Screen and it is great. I set up the Colours (Display Settings) of it on Natural which represents colors closer to what they really look like face to face. I wish it goes a tad brighter when I'm outside directly on bright sunlight. The issue that I notice is when using it on the lowest brightness possible which I do when the light is out at night. The screen produce some red-pinkish tint when using it in this setting, but getting the brightness up just a little bit (slidding it 1cm apart from the lowest end) eliminates the tint for some reason.6) Build QualityThe matte finish with the glossy finish on the poly-carbonate (plastic) seems to give it a premium look and feel. But be careful for it does scratch easily especially with the glossy finished parts. I've dropped it once out of my front pocket (it has a screen protector but no case at that time) and it just got scuffed on the front upper-left edge and the screen protector had a minor crack on the same spot.7) Dual Sim, Dual Stand ByWith Android 10, the Pixel 3a is now capable of doing this with an eSIM and an actual physical SIM.8) SoftwareGoogle's take on Android is clean, smooth and great overall. I appreciate that there's no bloatware or any pre-installed app that I will not likely use, but the native features seems lacking compared to other brands which have already caught up in refining their version of android and has provided more functionality like advanced screenshot options and built-in screen recorder which the Pixel 3a's Android 10 still doesn't yet have. But the advantage in having the Pixe 3a is the three (3) years (starting from 2019) guaranteed software updates directly from Google, which in my opinion is the greatest offering it has aside from the camera quality.Now back to the price. Again in my opinion, $399 is still a bit pricey compared to other brands which has greater specs, flagship-like build quality, battery capacity and better storage options at the same price point. Also by installing a Gcam APK Mod on those devices can make it perform almost like if not the same with the Pixel 3a. The same goes for the software, installing a launcher available from the play store or even installing a custom rom, you can tailor those device as close or maybe even better with the Pixel 3a.Still for $399 the Pixel 3a is a good deal for it offers great camera quality and great software experience out of the box, but going on other brands mentioned prior offers higher tier hardware for the money while putting an extra mile on setting it up you'll be able to get it on par or even better than the Pixel 3a. So, for $299 (or even less) it's justified and more competitive for what it offers</br>",2020年1月27日 在美国审核
Best phone out there compared to Apple and Samsung,"I use to be a sucker and get the latest phone from Apple to Samsung spending $1000s of dollars almost every year until I saw the Pixel 3a. I really didn't pay much to it until my co worker told me about it. I decided to see his Pixel phone hands on. I'm quite impressed for hundreds of dollars less you get all the same features in a smart phone that apple and Samsung has out as well. Google does better service then others. You don't really need animoji and other necessities that apple and Samsung charge to us consumers. Night mode on the camera is awesome don't really need to use flash. If you are a Google user as myself then this phone will feel just right. Having home devices connected to Google such as the Google mini and watches makes them easier to use. Best of all is the storage. While Apple and Samsung use phone storage to save photos and videos, Google gives you unlimited data space in their cloud service so every time you snap a picture or videos it gets automatically synced to their service which allows you to have more storage on your device. Oooh and did I mention the phone is only $399!!!!!! Check out the Google store online more information and specs honestly you rather spend over $1000 or $399 you do the math.

Almost everything about this phone is worse than the iPhone. I miss having multiple web browsers open at the same time. I miss my maps connected directly to Yelp as they always should be. For some reason this phone has 4 volume settings which makes it confusing to know which one you turn down and you missed calls. Just pay the extra money and buy a phone that's good. If you use Yelp on this phone do not ever turn it sideways or the entire thing will get deleted. There are some features I really enjoy about this phone now, you can watch a YouTube and do something else at the same time with the video in the top corner.

Excellent product,"Very fast (wi-fi download speed up to 230 Mbps, same as on my powerful desktop PC), well-designed, durable, aesthetically pleasing, reasonably priced smartphone (bought on sale for about $300 USD - really good deal).Excellent power management (battery life). Note: even though the biometric user authentication features are available, I do NOT use any of them (and do NOT recommend using such features) because said biometric properties specific to human individuals are non-resettable, thus may increase the security vulnerability (it's better to limit the intrusive technologies unless it's usage is absolute necessity). Therefore, I did not rate those kind of over-hyped features (the same consideration goes to other smartphones as well). It seems unfortunate that the product rating system is so heavily skewed by said over-hyped biometric features, rather than be focused on real consumer value-adding ones, like speed, display and camera quality, battery life, and variety of other ergonomic metrics reflecting overall UX.Based on these considerations, it's an excellent product!",2020年1月27日 在美国审核

There was also no screen protector that you peel off when a phone is new... So this leads me to believe that it was a returned phone, which is a little concerning/ sketchy.

It has a Google oriented OS which was perfect for me since all my accounts were with the FREE Google services. So if having a phone that can quickly pull up your personal calendar, your music, and even your documents without breaking bank is not for you- then go buy that latest phone with the useless features and pay it off in 3 years.",2019年10月22日 在美国审核

Incredible phone for the price,I've used an iPhone 6S since launch that finally kicked the bucket. I was in the market for an inexpensive phone and the 3a had everything I needed for an excellent price. I compare the feel of the phone to that of the iPhone 5c. You can tell the phone is plastic but it feels sturdy in your hand. The camera is amazing and the fingerprint reader is very accurate. I love this phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone in the market for a new inexpensive phone.,2020年4月27日 在美国审核

"Long battery life, big screen, great camera, latest android software","I had a old phone that was glitching and the screen broke for 2nd time, so I researched and spent more than wanted to on this baby. Its a great phone.A bit slick w/o case, makes it hard to hold but I got the Unicorn Beetle case and have no complaints about that one - everything works with case and protection seems really good. Anyway back to the PIxel phone. I have not had it more than a few weeks but its great.* battery life - It goes for days on a charge. My old Moto G4 got to where it was drained in half a day of light use! Just camped and didn't have a charger (note doesn't come with car charger and the USB-C is not standard, supplied cable is not going to fit USB standard jacks). So I'm camping with family July 4 long weekend and the thing lasts from Wed to Sunday!The wifi and bluetooth both work better than old phone as I have a BT thing hooked to receiver powering backyard speakers and no dropouts. The old phone would constantly drop off and I'd have to reconnect to WIFI as well. Much better.Sound is OK and screen is high resolution of course, and haven't taken a ton of pictures but really was impressed with a few low light ones I did take over the camping trip.I would buy it again.",2019年7月11日 在美国审核

Burnt (with smoke and blackening) 3 different chargers.,"I bought this phone late November 2019 and immediately put a case on it before using it. March 21st it stopped charging in a few chargers but the , March 22nd it got very hot and started smoking with an awful burnt smell while charging. I took it to a google certified repair shop and it burnt their charger black. They inspected it and said it looked clean/well take care of but there must be a problem with the board after running their diagnostic software.It had been working very well for a while so i'm not sure if something got knocked loose or if it was put together poorly originally.Anyway really sucks to pay $300 for a phone that worked for 3 1/2 months.",2020年3月23日 在美国审核

Great phone. Excellent camera and screen,"I have never spent a lot of money on the newest phone--in fact this phone is by far the nicest and newest phone I have ever had. (I am the type to buy a refurbished iPhone 5 when the newest model is an iPhone 8). That said, I think this phone is great. I've use this with Google Fi, so I haven't had to use a SIM card, though it does have a slot for a SIM so you can use it with any plan (or if you want to use it overseas but don't want to use Google Fi.)I'll list my favorite features below.Best things about this phone:1. It's very lightweight and thin, though it has a nice large screen with great video quality and bright clear colors.2. The camera is great. So much better than the camera on my Samsung Galaxy J5 Prime. It has motion capture so when taking pictures of moving things (like my 3 year old) you can select the best shot out of a sliver of video. It seems to me that this helps prevent blurry photos which have been a chronic issue of mine with other phone based cameras.3. It charges quickly. I am constantly on my phone putzing around when I am bored so the battery depletes relatively quickly (it will last about 24 hours or so with pretty heavy use--no video streaming, but surfing the web, playing games, etc.) happily it charges very quickly. I assume it's the USB-C port that does this as other electronics that use USB-C also seem to charge faster. Still, it only take 30 minutes to an hour to fully charge the phone when the battery is almost dead.4. There is good responsiveness in the touch screen. It is very easy to navigate. I never find myself stabbing the screen with my finger in frustration.5. It is very easy to transfer files, messages, etc. from an old phone to the Pixel (and it comes with an adapter to facilitate this.) I could even move my text messages from my old phone to my new one.6. There is a good amount of storage included--64 GB.7. The sound quality from the speaker is good (nice bass) and can get very loud. If I am streaming music in one room at full volume, I can hear it well several rooms away.Things I wish were a little different:1. There is no slot for a micro-SD card. While storage is plentiful, I would like to be able to expand it if I want. Especially if I didn't want to use google photos.2. The placement of the fingerprint scan on the back (as opposed to on the front) took a bit of getting used to.3. I wish there was a better way to organize the apps. They are all in a single screen and can be hard to find a specific app.Overall, I love this phone. The things I have issue with are really quite small and nit picky. It's a great phone and the price point is not unreasonable. I'm so happy I got this phone. (I really have enjoyed the Google Fi service as well, but that is would be a separate review.)",2019年7月18日 在美国审核
"Great phone, very happy with its performance across all aspects","I researched phones for several hours and am very glad I bought this one. Routinely I have 65% battery left at the end of the day. I like the USB-C charging port, no worrying about orientation of the plug. I use my phone to check my work calendar often and the fingerprint reader is very handy, I have it programmed for a finger on each hand which is helpful when I have a cup of coffee in the other hand. The phone is quite peppy and no delay on loading web pages, videos, or photos. The camera is excellent.",2019年11月27日 在美国审核

Incredible phone,"I have been using flagship phones for a looooong time and I decided it is time to stop paying big bucks only to get another model thrown in your face 6 months later.I chose pixel after considering other ones mainly because of the camera reviews and it did not disappoint. Photos are absolutely stunning and astrophotography mode is just insane.Because it is very barebone stock Android it runs really smooth and for the price it is an excellent machine .Looks good, feels good in the hand and does everything you need a phone to do.It doesn't have any stutter problems with more demanding games or apps.Fast charger works pretty good. Not excellent but good.And most importantly it is US factory unlocked so all bands are present and I never miss a call or text again.Google has created an absolute beast in the mid price range and I doubt anyone will tip that for a while.",2020年4月7日 在美国审核

"Great phone, great battery","I rarely give 5 star ratings, even for very good products, I usually feel there was room for some improvement.But when taking into account the competition and pricing, this is a 5 star phone.I don't game on my phone, but loading apps, response time, web browsing, watching videos, etc all perform fast and flawlessly.While I don't push the camera hard, the pictures look good and even ones taken in less than ideal conditions came out better than I expected based on previous (higher end) phones.And the battery life is stupendous!!Obviously this will vary based on usage, but I get two full days of light usage!And easily a full day of heavy usage.I have the XL and my wife has the smaller screen, both have been great.While there are certainly valid use cases for a flagship phone, Pixel 3a's will more than suffice for the vast majority of people at half the price!",2020年1月26日 在美国审核

Superó todas mis expectativas,"*El teléfono viene desbloqueado y funciona perfectamente con la red Telcel.Al ser mi primer Pixel, tenía las expectativas muy altas con respecto a la cámara y para mi fortuna el Pixel 3a las superó todas. Tanto el software como la cámara trasera son idénticos a los del Pixel 3 que cuesta el doble que este modelo. Las fotos que toma son increíbles, se acercan bastante a mi cámara mirrorles a la cual le he invertido casi 3 veces el precio de este teléfono, con la gran diferencia de que puedes llevarlo a todos lados sin tener que cargar lentes y accesorios. Al ser un télefono de Google, la versión de Android es limpia, sin aplicaciones de terceros y muy fluído. A pesar de no tener el mejor procesador, he usado muchas aplicaciones sin problemas de rendimiento, incluso dos aplicaciones corriendo a la vez en pantalla dividida con YouTube flotando sin ningún problema. La pantalla OLED está a la par con las de teléfonos de gama alta. Cuenta con el modo Night Sight que de momento sólo era compatible con el Pixel 3.PROS-Impresionantes fotos de día y noche con HDR y modo retrato.-Modo Night Sight compatible con las cámaras trasera y frontal.-Sistema operativo limpio.-Pantalla OLED de 441ppi-Precio-Audio jack de 3.5mmCONTRAS-No es a prueba de agua-En video 4k sólo graba a 30fps.-Sin carga inalámbrica.Observación: La caja vino con las etiquetas de seguridad cortadas, probablemente por la aduana, sin embargo el teléfono por dentro estaba intacto con los plásticos sin remover y todo perfectamente sellado.",2019年6月4日 在墨西哥审核

Buen equipo por lo que pagas,"Acabo de adquirir el pixel 3a, tengo un iPhone XS Max, solo lo compre para trabajar y se me ha hecho muy buen equipo, la cámara y el rendimiento de la batería es espectacular llevo 3 días sin cargarlo y aún tiene el 30% (obviamente no lo utilizo mucho) honestamente no se puede comparar con ningún iPhone en los materiales exteriores el material se siente de plástico y nada premium, pero por el costo y para el tipo de uso que yo le voy a dar es suficiente, la pantalla se ve muy bien y el SO android es muy fácil de usar y es eficiente, solo en algunos casos algunas animaciones al navegar la interfaz se siente un poco soso o lento, pero como dije tengo un iPhone XS Max así que estoy acostumbrado a una experiencia muy particular",2019年8月10日 在墨西哥审核
"Mejor cámara, software y seguridad por el precio","Si buscas la mejor cámara posible, esta es tu mejor opción. No se dejen engaar por el hecho de que su competencia tiene 3, 4 o hasta 5 lentes para fotos, o que si tiene 64 megapixeles etc. Honestamente esos son trucos de mercadotecnia, y este Pixel 3a XL lo demuestra con un único sensor, pues toma fotos que incluso supera celulares que valen hasta el doble, se nota que Google optimizó muy bien el software de la cámara para que tome fotos a la altura del Pixel 3XL que es su hermano mayor a pesar de que este último cuesta hasta $150 dlls más. El único punto ""débil"" que le veo al celular es su diseo, que a muchos no les gusta porque en las tendencias actuales los celulares poseen pantalla completa, y los marcos superior e inferior son algo vistosos, pero al menos a mi parecer hace al celular más cómodo de usar ya que evitas tocar la pantalla accidentalmente mientras juegas o ves videos, pero eso es completamente personal. En cuanto a la pantalla, es de 6 pulgadas OLED y también es de muy buena calidad, (full hd+) para el precio, tiene sonido estéreo que se escucha fuerte, pero no recomiendo subir todo el volumen ya que se saturan las bocinas (aunque es normal, pasa incluso en celulares más caros) basta con bajarle 2 puntos al volumen e incluso así se escucha fuerte, cuenta con jack 3.5mm para audífonos, la carga rápida es de 18 W y entrada usb-c, posee lector de huellas digitales en la parte trasera. La batería dura bastante y les anexo mis estadísticas de uso para tengan una perspectiva de la duración (Mi record fue sacarle 7 horas de pantalla con brillo al 75%) y en el caso de Call Of Duty Mobile funciona con los gráficos en alto y nunca se me ha atorado o cerrado inesperadamente en el uso cotidiano, sólo una vez me pasó pero porque intencionalmente abrí como 20 aplicaciones y otros juegos porque estaba cambiando a cada rato entre los mismos para poner a prueba la potencia del celular. Un punto fuerte que para mi en lo personal es muy importante es que tienes 3 aos de actualizaciones tanto del sistema operativo como en parches de seguridad, y como plus el celular cuenta con el chip titan de Google, el cual se encarga de integrar bien la seguridad del software y hardware. Por lo que en cuanto a sus datos personales pueden estar tranquilos. El sistema operativo está muy bien pulido y funciona muy bien, ya que Google tiene control total tanto del sistema operativo como del hardware, y el celular funciona bajo al idea de como Google visualiza que debería funcionar android en los dispositivos con este sistema operativo. Si algo es seguro es que no se van a equivocar si deciden comprar este smartphone, les hará sentirse satisfechos con su compra.",2020年1月11日 在墨西哥审核

PROBLEM FIXED,"So at first, the phone received wasn't unlocked. After contacting the seller, they assisted me. They gave me a prepaid shipping label to return the phone and sent me one back. The second phone i received is perfect and unlocked so i raise my evaluation from 2 stars to 4 stars. If everything had been fine from the start i would've give 5 stars but i had some problem at work because of it. In the end Cellulartech were great and helped me to fix the mistake. Thank you!",2020年10月22日 在加拿大审核
Cheaper than from Google store - saved $175!,"I got this phone from Swiftronics Canada. Delivery was timely and the phone arrived brand-new, factory sealed. It's a U.S. phone from T-Mobile (unprogrammed T-Mobile sim card in the phone), English-only packaging and ""instructions"".<br>A great phone, no issues, works perfectly, inserted my Canadian carrier sim card and I'm good to go. I'm assuming Google factory-packaged the phone for the US T-Mobile market because it unpacked like new, down to the ""VOID"" plastic stickers they use to seal the box (only says VOID when you peel off the sticker from the box to indicate box has been opened). I've been burned by re-packs and refurbs before, (other companies), so I always pay great attention to the packaging to avoid that kind of a situation - if the vendor says New, then it better be New...Thanks Swiftronics!</br>",2020年9月19日 在加拿大审核
Passable value.,"Certainly a better value than the classic Pixel3 XL; Pixel ""a"" series is always the preferred Google phone option.Basically the same camera features; software feature drops; Android 10.0 compatibility; industry-passable display and battery performance.If you are on a sub-1000$ budget, this is one of the best smartphones currently available to you in my opinion.",2020年7月26日 在加拿大审核
Cámara deja de funcionar sin motivo,"Compré el Pixel 3a en junio de este ao y desde hace unas 3 semanas dejó de funcionar la cámara frontal sin ninguna razón aparente. Al principio no me preocupó tanto porque es la segunda vez que ocurre, la primera ocasión el problema duró solo un par de días y se corrigió automáticamente, pero esta vez ya duró más y no importa cuántas actualizaciones pasen, no tiene para cuando corregirse y, por lo que he leído en otros, esto es un problema común en los Pixels, incluso en la cámara trasera, lo cual es triste porque es uno de los features más fuertes para adquirir este dispositivo.Otro aspecto igual de decepcionante es la duración de la batería, no es lo que prometen. Y ocurre lo mismo que con la cámara, el servicio a cliente y soporte es casi nulo en México.Por lo demás, el rendimiento del teléfono es muy bueno, aunque no es superior a otros modelos del mismo rango.",2019年10月15日 在墨西哥审核

Great battery life!,"Really happy with this phone so far. Had been using a Galaxy S8+ the last few years and was looking for something new, with better battery life (I was usually get 12-14hrs on my S8). So far the 3a XL hasn't disappointed! Yesterday I went to bed with the phone at 37% battery after being unplugged for 17 hours and had over 5 hours of screen on time (still had another 8 hours in the tank according to the phone). My only complaint is with the Pixel launcher which forces you into having the Google search bar and what's happening widget in your homescreen all the time. Can't be removed.... Considering I was looking for the 'true' Android experience I was floored that they won't let you change that. Oh well, went to the Play store, grabbed Nova launcher and all is well! Performance is great and the camera is fantastic (especially the night site feature).",2020年6月29日 在加拿大审核

Pixel 3a XL la mejor camara al mejor precio,"Lo que esperaba, una excelente cámara trasera toma fotos muy buenas, esperaba un poco mas del modo nocturno (Night sight) aun así una excelente cámara que compite con celulares de alta gama de 20k,la cámara delantera es decente no la mejor entre todos pero si por lejos a las de su precio, desde el primer dia podia actualizar a Android 10 (tiene Android 9) aunque no lo he actualizado para evitar bugs tiene un diseo stock android muy bueno por lo que no le he puesto un launcher como a mis otros celulares, no lo he probado con juegos que demanden un buen procesador pero por ahora es muy fluido y veremos despues de 1 ao si se llega a deterior, igual la batería te puede durar 1 dia usandolo excesivamente; con youtube, facebook , instagram, sin ningun problema, normalmente duro 2 dias para cargarlo.Las dudas comunes es la pantalla, o la parte de atrás que no es de vidrio, no creo que alguien tenga problemas, es una buena pantalla oled que cubre significativamente parte del dispositivo, tiene buena resolucion y calidad, y en si el cuerpo del teléfono se siente ""premium"".Lo que no me ha gustado de las bocinas (suenan fuerte y claras con un poco distorsión cuando las pones al maximo) es que tiene la segunda bocina en la parte de abajo por lo que usualmente cuando veo un video la suelo tapar con mi mano.En resumen, las primeras actualizaciones al sistema Android, excelente camara, buena batería (mr who's the boss compara cuánto dura la batería en 5 celulares gama alta y el pixel gano durando 8 hrs, pixel 3a xl 3700mah -8 hrs vs Asus Zenofone 6 5000 mah- 7 hrs 32 min), y un buen acabado, lo considero un excelente celular para ser gama media y lo más sorprendente es que compite con los gama alta.Por ahora le doy de calificación: 4.2ya que no lo he utilizado lo suficiente y no le he demandado tanto al procesador con juegos pesados.",2019年9月16日 在墨西哥审核
Great phone but battery is crippled with Android 12,"I went through a lot of hoops to get this phone at a satisfactory quality for the price I wanted, and it took over a month of returns and talking with customer service representatives, but it was totally worth it in the end.
