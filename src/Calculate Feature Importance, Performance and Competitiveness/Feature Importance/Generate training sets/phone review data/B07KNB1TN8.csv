A lengthy review of a refurbished galaxy note 9,"I did a lot of research before buying a phone, and was quite worried that I would get ripped off from purchasing one online. Additionally, I've had poor luck with several of Amazon's third party retailers. With this in mind, I was very skeptical about potential false reviews, false advertising, or a damaged product. However, for the price it was the best deal I could find on a galaxy note 9 outside of a carrier plan. So, after seeing that the item was returnable I gave it a shot. Luckily, it worked. I recieved a fully unlocked note 9 with a charger and instructions on how to activate it.I will say that many of the reviews I read prior to buying insisted otherwise, and they were likely correct. If you're purchasing from Amazon, you'll probably see several similar looking deals with identical display pictures (which isn't a good sign in my book). Even if it is a prime eligible deal be careful and read through the descriptions. Look at the seller information and read the return policies on refurbished phones. It should list something about being returned within 2 weeks of the original purchase. If it does not be skeptical. Also, It should be noted that anyone can make up a business name and description on amazon, then sell used items out of their basement if they wanted, so look carefully through the seller's ""company"" reviews.Furthermore, the charger that came with my purchase was not an original Samsung charger. It was a cheaper off brand model that charged slower by comparison. The phone itself had little to no scratches. These micro scratches are small and only visible after a very close inspection on my part. The battery life on my phone has been excellent! This came as quite a nice surprise. I've used it for several months now and it keeps a charge like new. I can go two full days with mild/moderate use off one charge. ( Mild/moderate meaning not using my phone constantly throughout the day to watch movies, play games, or scroll through social media posts. I may have watched short videos for class, read emails, texts, short calls, etc.)Overall, the phone has worked quite well and continues to do so. Last thing I'll say is I highly reccomend the galaxy note 9 for the specs to cost ratio (as of 2019). Its a good phone for the value, even though phones in general are expensive. Any additional information on the phone specs and relative market comparisons would require another lengthy review, so I won't drag this on any further lol.Hopefully this helped someone and thanks for reading!",2019年7月19日 在美国审核

Second Time's A Charm!,"Someone wrote that when we reviewed it would be helpful to write who we purchased our phone from so other potential buyers know who to buy from and who to avoid, so I will share my experience with trying to buy a secondhand note 9.<br>I had originally purchased a note 9 from WIRELESS WAREHOUSE. The phone was ""Amazon Renewed"" so I figured it would be in better shape, but it wasn't the quality that I was expecting, especially with the amount of scratches on the screen and the worn-out S-pen.Also, although the phone was supposed to be factory unlocked, the phone was locked to Sprint so it wouldn't work correctly with my Tracfone sim. For this reason, I ended up having to send back the phone.Afterwards, I bought a 2nd note 9, this time from EDGE CELLULAR and it came in near perfect condition with the exception of two little nicks on two of the corners but other than that, the phone was flawless [although, I did pay about $50 more for this one (total $440) than the original one I bought]. One thing different about this purchase was that it came in a Samsung box with all the original accessories including some headphones.Also, the 2nd phone was truly factory unlocked, so when I put in my Tracfone sim, it worked automatically. I'm much happier with the 2nd purchase and I think I will be keeping this one as long as it remains working well. I'll give an update in about a month or so to be sure.Hope this helps y'all.UPDATE: though it's been longer than a month, I just thought I'd mention that the phone is still great even in 2020. I absolutely love this Note 9 and am glad I made the purchase. Everything still works great!</br>",2019年11月19日 在美国审核
Great phone,"Opted for a note 9 instead of the upcoming 10 due to budget restraints and it is by far an excellent choice. I really didn't need all the bells ND whistles of the 10.This one works excellently. It came in a white box with charger, cable, Sim tray pin. I took out my Sim and SD card from my note 8, popped them in, turned on Samsung Switch on both ND let it rip. Done in less than an hour, every single app, contact, song, password, account, keyboard, done! Calls are much clearer, louder.This was a renewed phone and it is flawless out of the box.

No WiFi calling on this model,"Love the Galaxy Note 9 but I had to return this phone because it does not have WiFi calling. It was compatible with Verizon like it advertised but apparently the model N960u1 is not compatible with WiFi calling. It was suggested that the model N960u would be compatible with WiFi calling but since I can't check it before I buy it, I won't be buying factory unlocked again. I checked the phone at the Verizon store and it does have WiFi calling and is model N960u, so maybe it is just a model problem instead of an unlocked problem. However, it was indicated by the technicians that flash firmware would have to be downloaded on unlocked phones.",2018年12月10日 在美国审核

Just like new,"I know Amazon does not say which seller you bought from, so I'll say I bought my renewed Galaxy Note 9 from Re-Cell and I 1000% recommend to buy from them! I was very hesitant to buy a renewed phone, especially from Amazon where it's such a mixed bag. I'm glad to say I'm pleasantly surprised! I couldn't even tell the phone was ever used except for the fact that it was turned on in the box when I first opened it. The box itself was honestly impressive, it looked exactly like the galaxy note 9 box but with the seller's logo instead of Samsung's. I should also mention that it is listed as a Verizon unlocked phone, but came unlocked for all carriers!In terms of the phone, there were no scratches, dents or anything of the like. Everything is fully functional. The S-pen is the original Samsung one. No problems with call quality, wifi connectivity, etc. The charger isn't the original, but again looks like a replica of the original. I had a bit of an issue with getting the charger to fast charge the phone, every few minutes the screen would light up as it would stop and then start charging again. However, I have a few other fast charging adapters and cables, so this wasn't a big deal. The seller even included headphones! Nothing amazing, but enough to go above and beyond the Amazon listing.Again, I bought this phone from Re-Cell and can't verify the condition of the device you would get from another seller. But with the money back guarantee, I would recommend buying this phone and returning it if the condition is bad. You really can't beat the price.",2020年1月16日 在美国审核

Nice phone only a few minor problems,"**UPDATE 3-16-2020**Phone recently updated to Android 10 and it has gone south. I can charge the battery to 100% and go to bed, when I wake up 8 hours later the battery will be drained 25% or more. I found that if I leave wifi OFF it will only drain 5% overnight. So for some reason wifi now causes the battery life to shorten considerably.With only a 90 day warranty on the ""renewed"" phones, I am out of luck for repair 10 months after purchasing the phone.**ORIGINAL 4 STAR REVIEW** I bought a ""Renewed"" phone from Seller CellGuru. It arrived before the date originally quoted on the order. All i got was a phone and a charger. The battery was at 18% upon arrival so I plugged it into the included charger and went out for the night. When I returned more than 5 hours later, the battery was at 24% so I was shocked. I messaged Amazon and after a little troubleshooting, it appears the charger is defective. They gave me a credit to buy a new charger on Amazon and all is good.The screen does have VERY minor scratches which are visible only at certain angles in sunlight, so it's not 100% renewed.I had to take the phone to Verizon to get a new sim card because I was upgrading from a Note 4 with a much larger sim card. They gave me a new sim card in minutes, plugged it in for me and it was good to go! The guy at Verizon told me they can also give me insurance on the phone but I passed.The only thing that scared me was before I got the sim card, I used the phone on wi-fi to transfer all of my apps and such over. I opened Google chrome and it went directly to a Sprint home page. So, after seeing that I was afraid it was going to be locked to Sprint but it wasn't. It must have been a Sprint phone before being unlocked.The only reason I took off a star was because of the little scratches on the screen and the shoddy charger.I will update my review if things turn south with the phone in my 90 warranty period.If you found this review helpful, please click the button below.

"Charging port doesn't insert phone, not original type c charger, phone turns off at 14%","The phone wasn't in it's original box ""Samsung"", the charger wasn't the original one, it didn't come with the plastic new phones come to be protected from scratches, and the phone was also power on. The area you insert to charge the phone is a little off, in the sense of that the type C cable would not stay inside to charge the phone. You have to insert it very hard and even with that, the phone notifies me that it's not properly charging. I shouldn't have to insert the cable that roughly because no Samsung ever required that. The phone takes forever to charge, I put my phone to charge 12am it's 5:55am on a dec 6, 2019 and it has charged to 84%. The phone is nice and easy to maneuver but it has a flaw in the charging port area. The battery is also flaky because the phone turns off at 14%. This has been a huge disappointment and expensive mistake. I am returning the device.New update: I reached out to the third party selling this item for a refund. They never responded so I had to contact amazon and file a report with them. Amazon try reaching out to them and the third party didn’t comply.

Note 9 honest review,"I generally don't add reviews on products, but the reviews of others helped me make this purchase so I am paying it forward. First, I highly recommend you check the seller before buying and making sure they have a high rate of positive reviews and low rate/if any negative reviews. Also make sure they adhere to Amazons return policy, I saw a seller or two with additional hoops they add on top of the return policy, and I wasn't trying to bother with that noise. I purchased my Note 9 from CR Daily Deals. So far about 2 weeks after purchasing I am pretty satisfied with the phone. I previously had a Samsung Note 5 and the upgrade to the Note 9 was pretty nice. The biggest change between them being the battery life, the Note 9 lasts me from 6:30am to about 10pm and is about 50% battery life, its really nice not being tethered to a wall every few hours. I received only the Phone itself and a generic charger block and wire. No stylus nibs or extractor, biggest pain is no SIM card key, which also happens to be where the SD card is located. Thankfully 128gb is plenty for me for the foreseeable future of my use on this phone. Very easily got the phone activated on Verizon with a 5 minute store trip, and then using the Smart Switch app was able to move over literally everything from previous phone. At this point, putting both phones next to each other, you would only be able to notice a difference in the phone itself otherwise all my apps, photos, folders, etc. are exactly where they were on my previous phone. So far, no complaints on how the phone works (aside from small things I need to get used to), and no issues with the performance of the phone. The phone did also have a screen protector already installed on it, however it was almost 100% from previous owner not the seller and it does not cover the curvature of the screen. Literally just this morning I noticed there is a slight chipping to the edge of the protector, I highly recommend getting a protector that actually covers the entirety of the screen, that is my next purchase.<br>Overall, if you are somewhat hesitant to make the purchase, I will let you know so was I. Thankfully it ended up being a great purchase and I would recommend the seller CR Daily Deals or GoOverstock.com from the sellers I have seen. You are also covered by a solid return policy, but here's to hoping that will be unnecessary. Good luck out there!</br>",2019年8月27日 在美国审核

Great phone but you may need to buy a couple,"**Update**<br>The phone would not not connect to Sprint 4G. Samsung acknowledged that there is a software problem due to the merger of Sprint and Tmobile and they are not compatible with Sprint at the moment. Had to file an A-to-Z claim with O'Crack because they never refunded me after returning the phone.I ended up buying a few of these phones and returning the one I didn't want. The first one I received from Digital Age USA and had a screen protector on it, and a small gash. It was obviously a pre-owned phone that they were trying to pawn off as a reconditioned phone. If you receive a phone with a screen protector remove it immediately and check the screen, most of the time they are trying to hide screen burn or scratches. The second phone I received was from O'Crack and was like night and day, it was like a brand new phone. I am so glad I purchased the second one because I was starting to think that that was the quality of phones from this listing. The return went seamlessly and I was refunded my money within about a week. The phone itself is amazing, I've used the phone all day and still cannot drain the battery completely.

I admit I was a bit hesitant - I do not regret this purchase.,"I will admit I was a little hesitant on picking up a ""Renewed"" phone, I wasn't sure what to expect. I purchased the Midnight Black Note 9 from DNCL-TECHZONE, INC and so far I could not be more happy.<br>The phone came secured in an unmarked white box inside the Amazon package with a charger brick and a cable, I already knew this from the description and previous comments/reviews so this was not a surprise, I have headphones and other chargers so this was not a factor.My first impression out of the box - cosmeticallythe phone is absolutely flawless, no scratches anywhere, screen is perfectly fine. It even had what appeared as a form fitting protective plastic film along the top protecting the SIM card tray and the bottom where the speaker, charging port and S-Pen is located. The phone booted up fast, it guided me through the setup just like a brand new phone. Since the battery was down to 18% I charged it, again no issues at all. Full charge to 100% took about 2 hours, 20 minutes, (I'll probably pick up a fast charger at a later date.)Now coming from iPhone/ iOS the Android system is completely new to me and a slight learning curve, but a fun one. It did need a software update, it looks like the update from Aug. 2019 that adds Night photo mode, new user interface, other new features to the Android system. The update installed without any problems. Opening multiple apps, working with split screen, playing with the S-Pen, the phone is super fast, no apps - or phone crashed.I was working initially via WiFi with downloading apps, connecting email accounts, etc. A slight concern that I had was - would my Verizon SIM card on my iPhone work on the Note 9? (I've seen some posts that SIM cards have slight issues when swapped) For me, it worked without a problem, the Note immediately showed the device as a Verizon connected phone. Some of my contacts both iPhone and Android users transferred from my iPhone over to the Note 9, not all of them though - not quite sure why, I just assume that's a Verizon setting perhaps, not a big deal. Text messages worked fine, phone call quality is great. Adding the 128GB Micro SD - same area where the SIM card is located - immediately bumping this to a 256GB phone is also a beautiful thing!So far so good. I'm very happy with this purchase. I do recommend this seller.</br>",2019年10月23日 在美国审核

What a steal at $370 (Bought from Mobile Spree),"PREFACE: I purchased my phone from the Vendor Mobile Spree because I saw the reviews and nobody mentioned who they bought it from which made it difficult to find who was iffy with their Note 9 renewed versions so I had to do some researching. I found Mobile Spree with 9,000+ reviews with a rating thats almost 5 stars, so I went with that vendor so this is a review of Mobile Spree's Renewed Note 9.Review: Mobile Spree phone IS FACTORY UNLOCKED. I used the phone to use with Boost Mobile which means it also works with Sprint. So far its been a great Note 9. It looks almost brand new and works so much faster than my old S7 that I bought new for $600 which is insane to think I paid more for my S7 than I did for a Note 9, $370, THAT WAS 1000 dollars just last year. I didn't set my expectations so high since I knew this was a used phone, not refurbished its a used phone. There was some scratches on the edge of the screen thats like 1 mm long that looks like someone lightly scratched it against a wall or a concrete floor but it is not noticeable when the phone is on. You have to put your face against the phone and look at it in an angle. This was expected of a used phone so its not problem since I got a plastic film screen protector and I can't see the scratch at all anymore even actively looking for it. As for my BIGGEST concern with buying the phone is the battery life and if it would be horrible. I tested it and found it to have 3,600mAh capacity down from the 4,000mAh factory capacity which is great thats 90% of the battery life remaining after 1 year being used. Its so much better than my S7 which only had 57% capacity of its battery left after 3 years of poor battery usage (letting the battery go to 0%, leaving it plugged in over night, charging to 100% all the time, etc) A tip to prolong your battery life is to charge from a low 40% to about 60-70% and you'll keep your battery healthy for almost triple what it would be if you charged to 100% or left your phone plugged charging all night.My disappointment is the fact that the phone didn't come with a ""good"" charger, it came with a generic cord and generic AC adapter not a fast charging adapter. This was expected since the description said it probably wouldn't come with the factor accessories but I still wanted a somewhat good charger. I ended up just buying an Anker AC plug and USB-C cord.",2019年12月11日 在美国审核
Pristine Note 9 factory unlocked,"Hybrid IT sent me exactly what I ordered-a lavender note 9 factory unlocked. It was in pristine condition with no scratches or dings.

Best decision I have made in a long time. I am shocked. I am a tech guy and this phone is perfect. The battery health is at 97 percent. Not a single scratch on either side (I looked with Intense lighting) and every single component (wifi, Bluetooth, speakers, you name it) all work perfectly. I honestly feel like this phone was used maybe once and returned. Even the s-pen has full charge capacity. I could not be more satisfied. I will continue purchasing from this seller in the future!",2021年5月27日 在美国审核
Wonderful - but make sure you choose the right seller,"I've never purchased a renewed phone and wasn't sure what to expect. Most of these phones are sold by multiple sellers - and you can see their ratings on Amazon. I paid a little bit more (literally pennies more) to get it from Hybrid IT and I'm so glad I did. When I got the phone it looked new (no scratches or anything) but the sent the wrong version and the S-pen wasn't working. I was really mad and left a mean review but literally first thing the next morning Mark from Hybrid IT called and made sure I got a replacement by 1 day air. The replacement phone is perfect, and the seller's service was above and beyond my expectations - they could not have been nicer even when I was being a bit of a jerk.So by all means try a renewed phone, you'll pay a fraction of the new price. Just make sure you buy it from a seller with high ratings. I'm biased but I would strongly recommend Hybrid IT. They're a class act.",2020年8月26日 在美国审核

"If you think it isn't unlocked, read this first.","If you think your phone is not unlocked and still on Verizon, read this. Mine was like this and came with the Verizon start up screens, apps and a message saying ""Verizon SIM not inserted"", it was driving me crazy. After completing about 3 or 4 system updates, over about 30 minutes or so, it started booting up with the T-Mobile screen as per my SIM card. So, after all the updates the original carrier branding is gone and the current carrier info is there. Other than that, the phone looks like brand new and it was shipped quickly.

Seems like a brand new phone. Seller was Edge Cellular.,I was very hesitant about buying my refurbished Note 9 after reading all the reviews here. Saying that i decided to not buy the cheapest option and instead got my phone from the seller Edge Cellullar. They had a very good rating from a higher number of total ratings so decide to go with them. It was about $25 more but i could not be more happy.The phone i got is so perfect it makes me think they sent a brand new phone. It is a normal factory unlocked phone with no carrier apps. When i turned it on it was exactly like any other brand new unlocked phone i have bought before with the stock android UI.It also came with a brand new samsung charger and usb-c cable and the data migration plug. It even came with some earbuds even though it says right in the description those are not included. I did not rate the battery life as i just got the phone but otherwise im ecstatic with it so far.,2020年1月28日 在美国审核
Great upgrade from S5,"Received 5/31/19. Writing 6/3/19.Package included an unlocked 512gb Note 9, USB C cable, and a weird low voltage charger. That charger may or may not be normal specs for a new Note 9 but I expected a fast charge adapter.Connected without issue to Google Fi network with a new sim card.For the phone itself, I can't compare to current generation cell phones. Against my Samsung S5 the Note 9 replaced, feels like an entirely different piece of technology after the Android 9 improvements, processor &amp; memory upgrades.The stylus is fun to play with. I like to scribble and love the idea of taking ad-hoc notes without needing to search for paper. Time will tell if it becomes a tool for me, or gimmick.Coming from 16gb to 512gb is like moving out of a studio apartment into a mansion. I'll figure out a way to use up all the space, but right now it's damn roomy.I have a hard time justifying the price, even in the low $600's, when there are brand new phones for hundreds less. Not to say it isn't worth it, comparatively.If you are struggling to make the leap and do nothing more than make calls, text your grandchildren cryptic half messages that make them worried you're having a stroke, and play mahjong on Tuesday's, might want to find another phone.If you enjoy leading tech and can go years with the same phone, this is a good purchase.",2019年6月3日 在美国审核

I do not work for the seller,"First let's address the ""stolen phone"" issue. These phones are not stolen. Amazon would not help sell stolen property. Second. These phones are in fact unlocked. Some do come with bloat wear from a previous carrier. But most do not. What I read in the negative reviews is from people who simply don't know how to set up a Droid device, so they take it to a carrier store. Guess what happens then, the carrier store realizes there's very little money to be made so they tell the customer they can't use the Amazon device. And try to sell them a new carrier branded phone. My device is basically brand new. No carrier bloatwear. No scratches dings or dents. And it works flawlessly. After about 20 updates. Which also tells me its never been assigned a carrier. And even in 2022 the Note 9 is still a great phone. And I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The shipping speed , quality of the device. Its all 9.9/10. This is a great phone.

Perfectly Satisfied! (T-mobile customer),"Despite many of the poor reviews, I took a chance on this purchase and I have been suitably impressed! Yes, the box it comes in is not a branded Samsung phone box, and the fast charger is not a branded Samsung charger, but who cares? The charger works (and is now in a drawer with all the other chargers) and the box is in the trash already. The phone is flawless! Not a scratch or fingerprint anywhere. Included in the box was a return sticker so if I was not satisfied, it was ready to return immediately.I am a T-mobile customer and I was dismayed to see the Verizon logo display on the screen on the initial boot up. I had put my T-mobile sim in the phone before the first boot so I was thinking ""ah crap, going to have to return it"" but the phone displayed a message something to the effect of ""do you want to reset the phone?"" which displayed over the standard Android new phone experience wizard you would expect to see when starting a new phone. I clicked on ""yes"" and the phone restarted. It displayed the Android logo with the two arrows slowly spinning for about 15 seconds, then the phone restarted and BAM! There was the T-mobile logo with the T-mobile startup jingle! I didn't know it would do that!The phone connected to my T-mobile network without a hitch. T-mobile wifi calling works perfectly. I use a YubiKey 5 Series dongle to secure my mobile devices and instead of needing the USB-C adapter to plug into the phone, I was prompted to place the key on the back of the phone. That was all it needed! The NFC worked perfectly.Before the end of the day, this new phone received 3 updates, the last update taking the OS to Android 10. Nice!All this for $350!

Great Phone,"I'm not going to lie—I was very leery about getting this phone. This was the first time I had ever bought a phone (up until now, I was just using hand me downs that had been given to me by family members that had upgraded) and I wanted to be sure I was getting something worth my money, especially when the asking price was around $400 (not including taxes, which were a whopping $40). I read the reviews, both negative and positive. The negative ones were mainly published by people who had purchased the phone expecting it to be factory unlocked and it wasn't, which resulted in them having a phone that was locked to a different carrier other than the one they had. I have Verizon Straight Talk, and I figured if I got a Verizon locked phone that my SIM card would work with it, so I ordered one that was Verizon locked instead of factory unlocked.It came within 3-4 days and looks brand new. Other than the barcode sticker on the back, it appears to be brand new and not refurbished. After getting it on and connected to the WiFi, I pulled the Verizon Straight Talk SIM card out of my old phone and popped it into the new one. It started working immediately and has been ever since. I've now a case and a protective screen on it to keep it as safe as possible. It has been and currently is working great.

"Great price, Great Phone, Hard to activate service.","I got my phone from CR Daily Deals. I will have to say I am quite impressed for the price. The charger was generic, and they don't include the tool to remove the sim card tray or headphones. The phone looked brand new other than some adhesive that was stuck to the top of the phone I'm guessing this was from a screen replacement. It took some time to get setup with my service. I noticed some people saying it was locked out. When I put my sim card in the phone it said this device is not on a registered network. To fix this I did a factory reset. This also did not work at first. After trying a factory reset I called my phone provider and told them I would like to change to an unlocked phone and use the same sim card. They asked for the IMEI# and a few other things and set it up on there end. After speaking with my carrier and transfering phones on there end I did one last factory reset so the phone would recognize the carrier change and when it powered back on everything was working and the phone has better service than my old phone.

Note 9 is a great choice for a bargain,"This phone may be 2 generations old now, but boy can this thing fly. I bought this for my brother-in-law and I had him report back of things he likes and dislikes and his review was very glowing:Pros:- Battery life, even under heavy usage he usually has to charge it by days end and sometimes after a day and a half.- Screen. This thing is beautiful. The note 9 has a huge screen and the color is so vibrant.- The stylus: It is crazy to me this is a pro because Samsung seems to be killing off the note line. There is so much functionality here from taking pictures, jotting notes, and if you are feeling creative doodling.- Audio jack: This still has a physical audio jack and it is the last phone with it from Samsung.- Gaming: My brother-in-law loves playing PUBG and he says playing on this is so smooth. I prefer a controller or keyboard myself. But if your looking to game on a phone this one can handle it like a champ!=======================================Cons:- He isn't a fan of the curved screen, but all Samsung phones have this. At this point if you don't want a curved screen you have to look somewhere else.- Fingerprints. This phone shows fingerprints shockingly easily, but most do.==============Overall: If you can't tell by now this phone is a winner. For as cheap as it is now you can't lose.

Exactly as advertised.,"I purchased this Note as a secondary device for work productivity and Google Home integration (my iPhone does neither very well). I'm not entirely sure what kind of problems some of the other reviewers were having with getting their service to work, but I can assure you that this is an unlocked handset. It came out of the box with Verizon carrier settings, and all I did was put my Mint Mobile SIM in and it auto-loaded the T-Mobile (backbone for Mint) carrier settings and rebooted. Worked instantly. It even automatically deleted the Verizon bloatware and replaced it with the T-Mobile bloatware! :)As far as the device itself goes, you get what you pay for. This is a renewed device, and there are caveats that go with the purchase of said type of device. Having said that though, it looked and ran like a brand new handset right out of the box. No issues with performance whatsoever. The screen was in perfect condition. The only MINOR physical imperfection is the way the bottom of the screen meets with the steel frame of the phone. Nothing broken, scratched, or loose. I THINK the screen has possibly been replaced, and something just couldn't be re-aligned like it was originally in manufacturing. It should definitely be noted that I had to LOOK to find this. The average person who isn't insane, like myself, would never notice it.The last note (haha) is the battery condition. According to AccuBattery, the battery is around 84% capacity. This is a renewed device that I paid $365 for which originally sold for $1000 just over a year ago.

Exceeded Expectations but Winding Path to Get to Purchase,"My experience with the Note 9 has been very good. It has been by far the best smart device phone that I have owned. I have had it about 4 months.To create context, I almost went with the Pixel 3, but the whole ""notch"" discussion plus the product cycle and limited distribution gave me hesitation. My Note 8 which I owned for over 2 years was a disaster. The screen tension was horrible which led to many micro-fractures. It lacked durability. The battery life was horrible and Samsung pushes an incredible amount of bloatware at you. Also there is no good reason to use Bixby and Samsung keeps pushing that at you as well which affects usability and customer experience. Samsung almost lost me.I wasn't predisposed to getting the Note 9.But i did.The Note 9 in my experience has been everything that the Note 8 was not - durable, long battery life, fast processing, great photo quality etc. The 128G version is just fine and can be extended if necessary with a micro sd. Why would anyone put more than 128G on their phone? I purchased a ""refurbished"" from a reseller, in an unlocked version to keep the cost down, and as it turned out it worked just fine. But transferring the SIM chip and doing the restore I was operational pretty quickly.I can now recommend the Note 9 with a clear conscience. A solid device... The alternative that could be considered is the One Plus 6 T. I did a little research post purchase and the 6T stood out for both cost and design. It seems like it would be a viable alternative. It is only distributed through T-mobile or online.But Note 9 is good for my purposes, specifically a mix of business and personal. Hopefully this can help you.",2019年3月10日 在美国审核

Fantastic!!,"I've been meaning to write this positive review for 3 months because all the negative reviews almost deterred me from what is by far my best purchase ever from Amazon! I didn't want a hard inquiry on my credit and a monthly payment to finance a cell phone through my wireless carrier. Everything was perfect about this purchase!! I received a *flawless* Galaxy Note 9 with a Samsung stylus and USB-C charger; the only difference from ""brand new"" was the plain box. There was not a single scratch or blemish on the phone or screen and I had no issues with the phone reading my TMOBILE SIM (this seems to be most people's chief complaint, and a small amount of time and research could surely rectify this issue). It was completely plug and play and I still cannot believe I got a phone this nice for less than $400. Fast shipping, perfect product, I am very, very pleased with this purchase.",2020年1月15日 在美国审核
"2022 customer, it works!","I ordered the midnight black one and it came in quickly. Everything was new, with no scratches or single dust on it. I powered it on and tried to insert my old phone sims card to it to activate it but it didn't work which quickly made me worry if the phone was locked or if I got scammed. (Tmobile sims btw) and I later found out I had to actually call T-Mobile and request it. It ended up working after I got off the phone and I transferred my data over and everything. So it's working now perfectly. I know some people think it's locked liked I did but try calling your carrier and request to transfer it through them. Everything else I tried didn't work and I almost gave up. Just do this method if you having that problem.",2022年3月11日 在美国审核
"This is how I feel about my first Amazon ""renewed"" phone purchase...","(I wanted to show you guys a picture but I only have one phone and Amazon wouldn't let me upload the pic from the order--so use your imagination -- it is a Lavender Samsung Galaxy Note 9, with a Lavender stylus. Looks brand new)I have never ordered a phone from Amazon. I feel like everything is a huge warehouse which can make for easy mistakes on a small order. But I was NOT disappointed by my purchase. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 128GB, Lavender Purple - For T-Mobile (Renewed) -- I was going to opt for an unlocked, but I felt like it would just make life difficult if it wasn't compatible with my network in some way -- I knew I was not changing carriers so may as well go with my current carrier.When I first got my phone at first I thought something was wrong with the screen because on one side of the phone it required more pressure than the other side to operate properly. I thought it might have been the screen protector I put on it (it's a thicker one that blocks side-eye views of the phone) but then I realized the settings FOR screen protectors to allow for more touch sensitivity had to be turned on (still not sure why only 1 side was effected, but at least this setting being activated was the solution for the entire phone).The phone came with the specified GB and features.Great reception/strong signal -- meaning no dropped calls in areas where I don't normally have calls dropped calls.Zero issues being compatible with TMobile. It took the rep less than 10 minutes to sync my phone to the carrier and switch over everything from my old phone to my new phone.Stylus is fine.. it sometimes says that it's low on connectivity when I haven't used it long, but the functionality is still there so I don't worry about it.The price for this phone came at the PERFECT time in my situation.It was probably priced lower because it is a lavender phone. But I bought a black case for it, so don't let a color you don't like deter you. To protect these investments we're going to get a case anyway so save money and buy a less desired color like I did.Everyone couldn't believe I got it for this low--- no other online retailer had this price with this type of guarantee which is why I risked it. And I'm glad I did.I waited over a month to create the review so that I could really ensure the phone's operational consistency. And I am not disappointed. Gets 5 stars for shipping, accuracy of description, pricing, and quality of phone.Thanks again.",2021年9月13日 在美国审核

Whats Not to Like? NOTHING !,This is not my first Note 9 nor dare I say will it be the last as we use them in business. We have used these phones as portable computers as well as phones and the Note 9 shines in all the ways we need it too. We have had and have both the 512g and the 128g and they have done the job equally well with the 512g being only a tiny bit faster than the 128g. No problems with battery life or performance and in fact no short comings at all so far. This is why we continue to buy and use them. They are now less than half the price of what they were and for us a better value than the the 2 newer models with less features. These are rock solid phones and believe the best bang for the buck giving up Nothing!,2020年1月13日 在美国审核

"Works with Verizon, Read Below","Works with Verizon but you'll need to have a micro SIM already on-hand.I bought this phone but only had a regular SIM card available. I went to Verizon and they refused to give me a micro SIM for this phone since ""it's not compatible"". However, I had another phone that took a micro SIM card available and got a new micro SIM registered to that device.Once I was out of Verizon, I swapped the new SIM into this phone and it works perfectly.So, either have an micro SIM already registered or you will need to have a ""Verizon Compatible"" phone available to get a new micro SIM registered to your account.Not sure why Verizon insists on having your SIM tied to a ""Verizon Compatible"" device, even if the device supports their CDMA network.Phone was in great condition.

"Great Phone, Absolutely Stupid Design","I have been using computers since the 70s when I was in college and purchased my first IBM clone in 1992, and was using PDAs very early on.I had one of the first Windows smart phones but got rid of it in favor of a flip phone.....why?As a physician, I had been tied to a pager for years, and I really hated trying to do anything with such a small screen.I never jumped on the iPhone bandwagon either.Finally, as the screen sizes have increased, I decided, ok, there are apps that I may find useful as well as the integration of my Google Calander and Contacts with my phone.But, while sure, I could spend over a grand on a new phone, it just did not seem to me to be a wise use of my money.I had read that a lot of smartphone addict aficionados look for the latest and greatest.....or maybe they did not like the color of their new phone....so they sent it back.Rather than winding up in landfills as a lot of returned Amazon merchandise does, unfortunately, Amazon was wise enough to create their refurbished division in which various refurbishers compete for customer's business.I thought, why not give it a try.I purchased the phone from a company named Kiss in Manhattan where I grew up.They had a high positive rating so I picked themMy phone arrived the next day despite the fact that I did not pay for overnight shipping.Unfortunately, as I understand it, the ripples of the COVID situation put them out of business.As for the phone, when I opened up the box, I was shocked.In terms of appearance, there was absolutely no way I would have known it was a refurb....not a mark on it.As far as function is concerned, I used various apps to test it, and it passed.I have been using it since the first week of August.My estimate of battery life remaining is upwards of 90 percent.Of note, at Batteries and Bulbs, I can replace the battery for something like 70 dollars still putting me way ahead of the game since the phone was under 400 dollars.Add a Microcenter 512 MicroSD card for about 50 dollars and I have a phone with 3/4 of a terabyte, far more storage than I anticipate ever using.So, why the 4 stars?The phone is very elegant looking, especially with its curved display.As such, it would look very nice put upon a pedestal in our living room.However, I did not find the phone in an art store.I purchased it to use every day as my mobile phone.What is the Note 9 made of?Simply put, it is basically glass placed over a metal frame which again is fine if you want to display it on your bookshelf, but not particularly practical.Unless a person is downright foolish, just about everyone puts a case on it.You can forget about using one of those clear cases that let the beauty of the phone shine through.Drop it and you are facing an expensive repair.I was using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case with a belt clip which I never used.The phone dropped on the stairs and the inner part of the case broke.I was not really upset about that for the simple reason it saved the phone.Now I am trying an Outbox Defender which looks pretty robust.How about the curved display?Yes, it looks rather elegant, but does one really need it for functionality?The answer is absolutely not.It only serves to make designing a screen protector problematic.As for screen protectors go, I think they are necessary and I have just resigned myself to the fact that the edge adhesives are going to wear out and to simply replace them every once and awhile.They are not particularly expensive.We as consumers really should not put up with this nonsense.Most of the smartphones made these days have similar designs.They reinforce the notion of built-in obsolescence, or in actuality, built-in fragility.Yes, technology changes very rapidly.But, the basic technology of how these phones communicate does not.There is absolutely no reason that we should have to get a new phone every year.They should last far longer than that in my humble opinion.The question is how can we communicate this to the manufacturers?We can't boycott them because they all pretty much do the same thing. It is something it think about.....just saying.",2020年11月3日 在美国审核

You're phone will work then. It is completely unlocked. Will work with any carrier. Came with stylus and phone charger. Buttons a little rough you have to press down firmly.

Great phone I'm back in the game,"I have seen some reviews where people have had problems with the phones they have received. I am happy to say I have had none of these. Pros: Fast shipping and phone came on time, phone look like new . The phone was unlocked none of the phone service bloat ware (my service is AT&amp;T) only Samsung and Google apps which can also be deleted if you so chose. Battery life seems good came in with a 40-50%charge. S-pen fully functional new and Samsung branded. I just popped in my sim card and service was ready to go. Great value for the money.Cons: Phone was not the ocean blue like my other one it was darker and more purple looking (side note this could be because it was a newer version of the phone and has darker paint it was also ever so slightly smaller then my original note 9) but who cares I put a case on it anyway. Came with generic chargerand wasn't a adaptive fast charger ethier. All in all very good buy will buy from them again........Pro tip mine came with the voice assistance turned on which messes with things when trying to initially set up the phone just skip through the Google and Samsung set up stuff get to the main screen go turn off voice assistance then update the phone then you can set up all the things like Google, Samsung accounts lock screen ect with no issue. Also if the touch is not working well during the set up use the S-pen to navigate..this is due to the phone trying to download updates while you are also trying to set it up..hope this helps ",2019年11月26日 在美国审核
First Impressions,"It's only been a few hours since I received this phone but I couldn't wait to post a review! I was super skeptical about ordering a phone online like this but I'm glad I did. First of all, I got the package way earlier than the expected delivery date which was awesome. Phone works great, I've noticed 0 problems so far. I saw in the phone information it said the brand was Sprint so I was initially worried it wasn't truly unlocked. But it activated no problem! I got a BYOP sim card kit from Straight Talk and used the Verizon sim card. Had no problem whatsoever! I absolutely love the phone itself. It's much bigger than the galaxy s8 I had and I love the stylus! It's super cool, and you can program the button on it to open an app. Lots of other cool features like the wide selfie and gif recorder (smart select S pen tool). I'm sure there's a lot I haven't even gotten into. No cracks or scratches. Can't quite comment on the battery life yet since I'm still on the first charge. The charging port looks a little worn but it works. The charger was off brand but I suppose I saved enough on the phone to splurge for a fast charging cord. ♀ Overall very happy.I will definitely update my review if I find any problems, but for now I am pleasantly surprised!",2020年9月3日 在美国审核
Been using this for almost a year now,"I thought it was a really good deal, a note9 for $420. It really was, never had any issues with it unless I keep it on and don't restart it once every 1.5-2 weeks it will slow down and have some issues. But other than that, all functions work properly and won't probably upgrade until next year as it is not giving me any issues at all. Facial recognition and the fingerprint sensor work seamlessly. The amount of options you have to customize how all the buttons work and other motions and how things work in general is amazing, haven't bought an iPhone since the 5S came out and am definitely never going back to iOS. You can get so much more out of an android phone, specially the Note series from Samsung, plus not to mention all the varieties of other phones that run Android, so many to pick and all so different.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核
Pleasantly surprised,"No incentive to write this review, just wanted to because I myself scan a million reviews before ordering everything.I broke my note 8 that I got for free and didn't want to spend a fortune on a new phone. I first ordered the moto stylus 2021 since its semi comparable and costs less but its way to big for my liking. Then I tried the 2020 version. The size was perfect but there's no notification light (sounds like a stupid gripe but important to me) and a few other things that made me miss my Samsung. I didn't even necessarily need the 9 but for the price why not. I kept the moto 2020 until my renewed Note 9 came in just in case, as I was super nervous about getting a renewed phone but when I tell you this thing looks perfect I mean it. Not a visible scratch on it, front or back. The fingerprint part is slightly and visibly worn but that's it. The phone does get hot sometimes but I can't tell if its any fault to being renewed or just is what it is. The phone is absolutely beautiful, the sound is amazing and a big upgrade from the 8. I got the lavender, which is a different tone from the 8 and I love this color version even more than the last. Shipping was to be between the 15-18 and it came the 15th ..and maybe the best part for me personally was that I was able to transfer everything from one Samsung to the other in 10 minutes with Smart Switch. I was struggling with this part with the other brand and it was essential because of the things I had stored.Would absolutely recommendordering from here, and just incase, you have a good return period if anything does go wrong. Make sure you're not ordering renewed from a knock off place..those will probably not offer a return date. Super happy with this phone. Thankful I took the risk.",2021年9月20日 在美国审核

WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO BUY THIS??,"Arrived quickly!!! This was a renewed device, so I didn't expect it to look brand new.The reviews I read mentioned not having the necessary accessories in the box. Package arrives its in a generic white box and I was pleased to see a Samsung charger and a pin to open memory card/storage compartment. The only flaw I could see was a small scratch on the glass, if you tilt it in the sunlight at the right angle. When the screen in on I can't even see it. Battery seems fine charges really fast. This is my first high end phone, I've always been too cheap to get something decent, I love it!!! I don't see any reason to spend more for a new one, save your money and get one of these.",2019年11月3日 在美国审核

So Far Works Great,"Arrived earlier than expected.As far as I can tell it works great. I just need to learn how this one works better since I went from a 4 to a 9.A lot more features.Only problem I had was the sim card from my old Note would not fit, but went up to the Verizon store and they took care of that for me and helped me get it set up and contacts added (at no charge).",2022年1月27日 在美国审核
Went from Note 5 to Note 9 with no regrets.,"I loved my Note 5 but after the Note 10 came out, I realized the 5 was starting to show its age.To be sure, I could replace the battery and probably get a couple more decent years out of the 5 but it wasn't getting any more Android updates and I could tell it was getting a little slower to launch apps.However I didn't want to spend upwards of a $1,000 on the shiny new Note 10.It didn't help that my wife had already upgraded her Note 5 to an 8.So after some soul searching and web searching for a good priced, gently used Note 9, I decided on this one.So far it's amazing!The battery life is easily double that of the 5 and apps snap open.The only thing I miss so far is the Flipboard/Briefing that was available on the 5 by swiping right.Instead there's Bixby now, but maybe I just need to customize and get used to it.The Note 9 itself arrived in near new condition.The screen is crystal clear with no scuffs or scratches, the back has a slight scuff which disappears when I put the clear case/cover on.",2019年9月4日 在美国审核
Basically brand new!,"The seller listed all the details about what a refurbished phone is and what to expect, but even then my expectations were met and more. No scratches, dings, booted up perfectly, battery lasts forever. The only thing missing was the stylus, so I just bought one separately, and it connected perfectly with the phone. It also came with a screen protector already on, though I opted to switch it out for a different type.Overall, this was a great buy!",2021年6月29日 在美国审核
Please read if you are metro,Am a long term metro cust and totally new to the unlocked phone scene. So was overjoyed when I hooked it up to wifi and had it working wonderfully. Google assistant was good and phone generally seemed impressive. Was then equally pissed off when I plunked in my metro card and Sim was not working. I was under impression it would work fine out of box. Anyhow I contacted the seller Wireless warehouse USA and they advised I needed to notify metro of the phones imee number (or similar) to get it to work on their network. So so took it in and paid $16.00 and now I have a kick ass flag ship phone for a bargain price. Working perfectly so far. This one is a keeper.

Best Renewed Phone Supplier,"Upgraded from a renewed Note 5 (one of the best phones ever) to the Note 9 128GB.I upgraded for:1. Better battery life (Note 5 battery was showing signs of failing)2. More RAM.3. Internal storage increase and MicroSD slot.4. Stronger in every way.I spent a good amount of time deciding which Note to upgrade to (RIP Note 7). The Note 9 turned out to be the best for the price (and the price for this renewed Note 9 had dropped over $100 by the time I actually got around to making the purchase).I selected renewed, NOT the renewed premium, and the Note 9 I received might as well be brand new.

Good refurbished product,"There are plenty of places to find reviews of the device itself - my short summary would be that this is still a great flagship, even in 2020.But the main focus here is that this is a refurbished unit.

No scratches or even smudges - you really couldn't tell it wasn't brand new.After a few months of use, I see no indication of any issues with this device.Considering the low price and great condition of the phone, I'd say this is a great choice for anyone looking for a large and powerful phone on a budget.",2020年10月3日 在美国审核

Highly sceptical to highly surprised and satisfied!!,"I wasn't sure about buying a refurbished phone online. Will it really work? Will it really be fully unlocked? Will it have scratches and dings? Well, I received my phone 3 days early and I can't even tell it's used! Swapped my sim card and wait..... It worked just as easy as that!!!! After playing with the phone for a while I noticed the S pen wouldn't connect so I thought, here we go.... I contacted Hybrid IT (the seller) the next day through Amazon and they responded in less than 5 minutes. They gave me a choice of an immediate refund of enough to buy a new s pen on my own (if I was in a hurry) or to ship me a new one no questions asked. I chose to let them send me a new one and low and behold I had a tracking number 5 minutes later. My new pen arrived in 2 days and works perfectly.

Contacted the seller to see if they sold replacements and they are sending out a replacement for free even though it's not under warranty, and have no obligation to do so. Please anyone reading this support this business while saving money, phones are expensive. This has been the best experience on Amazon, the internet, and probably earth as a whole.

May have to jump through hoops,"Well this phone is factory Verizon unlocked....I purchased it to switch h from straight talk to Verizon prepay however when I tried to activate the phone over the internet it said that the phone was not compatible with the Verizon network<br>Ok frustration sinks in, I call the seller and believe it or not the women on the other end was knowledgable, stating that the phone is in fact comparable with any network and that this isn't the first time this has happened.Ths reasoning is I did not buy the phone from Verizon so they lie to get you to buy a phone off of them, and if I went to a store and explained the situation that the phone would get activated...I have a family member who is in corporate for Verizon wireless and his comment was ""this is probably true""...So not wanting to go to the store I popped out my straight talk sim card from my old phone into this new note 9 and it works perfectly...so f Verizon, the item shipped in 2 days and thecustomer service was good....just be cautious you may need to jump through some hoops however its probably the cheapest you can get this phone</br>",2019年2月1日 在美国审核
Incredible Value,"My Galaxy Note 9 (Ocean Blue) arrived two days after ordering. It was packed a little loosely within its smaller box but survived the trip without apparent issue. The generic charging block/cable are functional. Minimal signs of wear are faded paint surrounding the charging port (from blind plugging no doubt) and a barely worn stylus tip. Completely functional device, no loose buttons or internal rattling, battery life easily beating my old Galaxy S8.

Better than described,"Shipped fast and was better than described by seller. The phone is a refurb and the marring and scratches described are so slight they are tough to find.

Took us 3 T-mobile stores to find one and 10 bucks in change. Once we had right Sim, phone works great!! So happy to finally get an upgrade.",2020年8月22日 在美国审核

Pretty good but minor scuffs and not factory unlocked.,"The phone I received had 2 small scuffs on the screen, like it was dropped on concrete but didn't crack the screen, there's one in the bottom right corner that is pretty visible but just off of the screen so it doesn't matter, and the other one is a bit smaller but on the screen, though when the screen is on you can't see it so it's not a deal breaker or a reason to send it back.Other than that it has some small surface scratches (who tf doesn't put a screen protector on a brand new phone?) but those aren't visible with the screen on either and I applied a screen protector to stop any of them from getting worse.This isn't a factory unlocked phone either as when starting it up it had the sprint logo and the model number is a sprint phone, but as soon as I put a tracphone sim in it updated the carrier and got rid of the sprint startup logo (didn't know that was possible to get rid of), so it's definitely an unlocked phone now as all carriers are required to unlock phones after a contract is up and even though it's not a factory unlocked phone you should have no issues, if you do have any just get a replacement cause this is a fantastic deal for this powerhouse of a phone.NOTE: My seller was Hybrid IT, the different sellers are all different refurbishers so if you get a bad phone return it for a refund and buy it from a different seller, most are around the same price anyhow.",2019年11月18日 在美国审核

So long story short, this is a useless phone that cannot be unlocked until the original owner pays it off.I was pretty much sold a brick for 600.00.This seller should not be allowed to sell things on here if they don't have to common sense to make sure the phone is useable first.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核

Best value for an Android power user on a budget,"I've had mine just three days but it is the best smart phone purchase decision. I will never again spend outrageous money on the latest smart phone every two years (this replaces a 4+ year old 32GB Note 5 I dropped $699 on). I'm sure most have done their homework on this phone for specs, features, and performance including camera, so I won't go into features detail and instead focus on condition and personal impression. This refurb I got is in impeccable condition. Not a single scratch anywhere except a small one where someone opened the sim/SD card slot. I mean it looks brand new. After the recommended full charge before powering on, I swapped my sim card from the Note 5 (T-Mobile), and ran through the initial setup and file sync (took about an hour for 25+ GB of data from the Note 5 to move over via the wireless option on my home WiFi). It was just like setting up a brand new phone at the store.I love the ocean blue color with the yellow S-pen. It reminds me of a Blue Angel jet. A quick battery check from a test shows it is solid and rated at the full factory spec 4,000mAh. WiFi streaming music for a couple of hours didn't drain it nearly as fast as what happens with my Note 5's 3,000mAh. Besides cosmetic flaws, I was worried about the condition of the battery as you never know how the previous owner treated the phone regarding battery management. Unlike some others, my phone did not come in the original case and just had some generic USB-C charging cord. However it is the fast version for connecting to the wall. It's just not the official white Samsung unit that came with it from the factory. It works just as well as I was charging it before power up from the wall.Overall, I cannot be happier and the fact that Samsung (and Apple) are now charging $1K plus for their high end smart phones is outrageous and I refuse to spend that much. Another ""proper motivator"" for me in taking this direction was that I can install a MicroSD card up to 512GB in the same slot as the sim chip, which the Note 10 does not have in the North America markets (you have to move up to the 10+ for that). I'm not paying $150 more for the 10+ on top of an already outrageous price point just to get an SD slot (don't want the larger screen on top of that). The other good thing is that the 3.5mm audio jack is still there for wired headsets and buds. I don't want wireless as yet something else to charge no matter how ""cool"" they look. Never mind we still don't know long term brain health effects of Bluetooth.Finally, I did order a case that I also highly recommend for this if you are into a minimalist design made by FITFORT for only $15. These phones are not going to be around for much longer in such great condition in the next couple of years, and they likely will not get less expensive as I'm seeing even my old Note 5 in refurb form going for $300+ here. So if you want to upgrade an older Note or Galaxy from few series back but don't like the price or removed features of the Note 10 and Galaxy S10 over their previous generation, this is what you want. I see myself keeping this phone 3-4 years just like my 2015-era Note 5 and I actually paid nearly half as much for it.",2020年1月22日 在美国审核

Great product!,"Everything came as described and expected. The phone was in great condition with the plastic wrap still around it. The charger and its block were included. As stated in the title the phone is unlocked and mine worked just fine, I just popped my sim card in and got on with setting up the phone. The item came in a generic white box instead of its original box, which I didn't expect it to. I switched from an iPhone 6s to this and so far it is exceeding my expectations. I love the large display, the camera is speedy with great quality. Of course there are certain features that I miss from my iPhone but so far the Note 9 has enough of its own features to make me become a convert. If you've done research about the Note 9 you are aware of Bixby. I am not a fan so I downloaded an app to disable the feature. I do wish the buttons on the left side of the phone (Bixby and volume) were better positioned, because I think they're too far up but definitely not a deal breaker. All in all, this is a great phone and the certified refurbished option makes it an even more enticing option if you're looking to upgrade.",2018年11月24日 在美国审核

No problems with Note9,"I bought my used Note9 from the seller, Re-Cell.I upgraded from a Note3.Along with others, I think it's important that reviews name the seller as the ""adds"" seem to change sellers, so reviews are all clumped together from different sellers.The phone looks 99% new.I pulled the IMEI number and did a search to very authentic samsung phone and also to see where made as I did not made in China phone, even if used.No problems.All functions seem to work great, I have not found any issues or problems.Phone is fast, and the screen is awesome. Videos are amazing, I was very surprised at the clarity of the videos and the quality of the pictures. But, as I mentioned, I am upgrading from a Note3, which is still to me a really great phone.The Note9 battery seems to be little weak but still makes it through the day without a charge.The add states battery to be at 80% + strength, which probably is. I realize the the Note9 has a bigger battery and that was important to me, I'll still give battery life 5 star as I feel that's what Samsung gets for putting a nice big battery in there that can last all day.My phone is 18 months old according to the imei check.I did not test the fingerprint option.Overall very pleased and would not hesitate to buy a used phone again from Re-Cell.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核

It was Unlocked out of the Box,"I always wanted a Note phone since I got my first Galaxy phone over six years ago. Luckily with Amazon Renewed I was able to snag a Note 9 for under $400. I really wanted the Note for the S-Pen, that was the only feature my Galaxy S9+ did not have. The release of the Note 10 was a major disappointment for me which was one of the main reasons I looked at the year-old flagship Note 9. Unlikethe Note 10 which took several steps back, the Note 9 has the headphone jack, dedicated Bixby button (Extremely useful for remapping for various functions), MicroSD card support, and a fingerprint sensor on the back. All features I need as a power user.I was pleasantly surprised when I received the product and found it to be in near flawless condition with only minor scratches that aren't noticeable unless you explain the phone closely. The stylus was there and works well. The battery was in good condition and like-new. When I turned on the phone I knew it was running the unlocked firmware since I am also running the unlocked firmware for my Galaxy S9+ and it has no carrier bloatware. When I put my T-mobile SIM card it worked nearly instantly.After using it for two weeks there has been no problems with it so far, all features seem to be working as intended.I can safely say this is the best phone I have ever used and may be the best Note Samsung may ever produce.",2019年11月28日 在美国审核

"Looked brand new, but had issues","I was blown away at how crisp and new the phone appeared. The battery life met my expectations, therefore I was happy in that regard. Had no issues with wireless charging. However, the s-pen was dirty and had some nasty grime on it which I cleaned -- not that a big deal, but I suppose something to note. After that was managed I began to setup the phone. During the setup process I noticed a couple of times that I thought I pushed the screen to select a specific letter/number, but either nothing happened or the click selected a different letter/number. For the most part (approximately 98% of the time) the touch screen functioned as expected so I didn't completely pay attention to this intermittent issue until I used the phone for a couple of days where it became noticeable.Next thing I noticed happen to involve calling into a line where touch dial was needed to select options. Sometimes I was unable to select an option although in the call app it showed I selected a number. In addition, I had a 100% reoccurring issue with calling into a support line to receive a text to verify identification, but when I would swap back and forth from text to call again the call would not detect I selected a number. After this would occur, to remedy the issue sometimes closing and re-opening would provide a temporary solution. If that did not work I would have to power cycle the device for another temporary solution. For a workaround I would have to turn the phone sideways (landscape) to see the code that was sent to me so I could stay in the call without swapping over to my text messages to see the code.Lastly, the USB-C port was not consistent with charging or connecting to my laptop/PC for charging although the interface would click in place as it were securely connected. This issue occurred approximately 90% of the time which is highly noticeable. Sometimes thephone would not detect that I attached outlet power to it (approximately 5% - 15% occurrence). I initially thought my power adapter and or cord were the problem. I swapped both of those out, but the problem persist. In addition, when I connect to a laptop/PC via USB-C the phone is constantly detected over and over. Even if I deny the USB access the phone again is detected over and over. I tried this with a personal and work laptop, as well as my home PC which all shared the same result.I got to this last point then decided to return the phone as I know issues would have persist or become worse overtime. This is unfortunate because I was excited to continue using a Note style phone. My friends and family use iphone's. After recent discussions I finally caved in and decided to give an iphone a shot. I hope all the hype for these phones stands true.",2021年9月10日 在美国审核

Without official Samsung Stylus it inhibits some functionality of the phone. This is the reason I bought the Note in the first place. The stylus is not an accessory. It is part of the phone.

Best renewed phone with oem accessories!,"I'm impressed, bought this note 9 128gb (black Verizon ver.) a month ago from these guys with fear of recieving a used, scratched up phone with off brand charger and no accessories in a white box like others offered on Amazon. WELL I WAS WRONG!!! I received a original samsung box with everything it came with from factory in factory sealed plastic!!! Sin card pin, S-pen tips/Remover, original charger and cable, AKG headphones (sealed-new oem), charging port headphone adapter, and transfer cable!!! All ""OEM"". I was shocked!! Then with my OCD i checked the condition of the phone under a magnifying glass and light, not a SINGLE SCRATCH on the front, and only 2 very fine, almost invisible scratches on the back. Around the Bezels/Edges of the phone still had the OEM plastic liner/cover without a nick or signs of use. Overall I feel as if I scored big time and was lucky with the draw but then again, lots of other reviews for this purchase state similar experiences. Now last but not least, I waited a month to write this review for this renewed note 9 because I wanted to test the battery health and life. Phone holds a charge all day with continued use (I own a Business) as if it was new. I'd give the condition and phone accessories a 10/10 and the battery health a 9/10 for a supposedly used/renewed phone. Save yourself 500 bucks and buy from GoOverstock. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",2019年8月10日 在美国审核

Super Duper Happy!,"Thank you Hybrid IT! I was at first apprehensive about purchasing a used phone off Amazon or anywhere online with all the bad experiences I've read about, but I'm glad I took the chance, because I'm loving my Galaxy Note 9. It looks practically new! All it had was a tiny nick on the bottom corner which is barely noticeable. I ran the IMEI and I was happy to find out it is a clean phone. I'll probably be trading it in down the road for a note 10 plus, but for now I'm Super Duper happy with this purchase. Phone looks beautiful, it works wonderfully and I had no issues connecting it to my AT&amp;T service and transferring everything even though I am tech ignorant. It also was well secured in the package and it arrived in a timely manner. I had to pick it up from Fedex, but that's because the driver was too lazy to deliver to my apt now that the leasing office is not accepting packages during Covid. Anyways, that's no fault of the seller, but I would suggest maybe using UPS or Amazon delivery instead, FedEx falls short sometimes. Welp, that's my 2 cents. Hope this helps others who may want to take the leap. Just be carefully what seller your buying from. I will definitely be purchasing other items for Hybrid IT!",2020年8月16日 在美国审核

SIM card matters,"First, the phone received is like new - no, and I mean no, visible usage are all! The phone came with the Samsung box, complete, like a new phone. Second, and this is for those who posted reviews about not getting the proper provider phone; this may be helpful for such future incidents. If you ordered an unlocked phone, which my supplier advertised, it is possible that a different cell provider may come up after initial boot of phone - don't be alarmed. My example, I ordered a Verizon phone, but my supplier (Amazon) also indicated the phone was unlocked, this means not locked into a specific cell provider; after fully charging the phone it booted as a T-mobile phone - NOT A PROBLEM - why - SIM Card. Power off the new phone and insert the SIM card from your old phone into your new phone, the phone will reset, there will be a couple of messages, OK, etc. Once the new phone resets it will then boot using you cell vendor phone boot process; in my case, Verizon. Hope this helps. Also, I want to say again, I am very pleased with my new NOTE9. This vendor delivered as advertised. Sidebar: The process to migrate my old phone to my new phone was a snap. Samsung makes the process very easily with its automated software process.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核

I regret purchasing a phone from Amazon and also this seller,"I purchased a Note 9 from this seller in October. After about 1.5 months from the purchase the phone started acting up when I connected my headphones to it. I thought there was something wrong with my headphones so I changed a few headphones but it didn't resolve the issue. I contacted the seller to replace the phone afterwards and they refused to do it and said it was a few days after the warranty period.Also when purchasing the phone I chose the option of installments with no interest to pay for the phone, I checked it multiple times and made sure that I had selected that option when checking out. But after a month they started charging interest on my credit card. When I contacted Amazon they said the installments option had not gone through, they refused to take responsibility, told me it was my error, they refused to help and after calling them multiple times one customer service told me he'd elevate the issue and gave me a ticket number. After several weeks they still haven't contacted me. I had to pay the full amount at once even though I wasn't prepared for it in order to avoid having to pay for interest and Amazon never took responsibility.I had to pay the full amount at once for a malfunctioning phone and I truly regret it. If you care about getting the service you deserve, and dealing with responsible sellers/customer service avoid purchasing a phone from Amazon and this seller.",2020年1月28日 在美国审核

Everything I Hoped it Would Be,"I got this phone to replace my cheap, older phone I'd had for a few years that was about to give out. It seriously lacked RAM so it was impossible to have more than 2 apps open at one time without the phone going hot while trying to do something simple, if not outright freeze, crash, and reboot. The battery was also giving out too, so watching movies/video was a no-go if I wanted to have the phone last more than 4-5 hours.The Note 9 was a phone that I've wanted for a little while now, and after finding it for such a steal I decided to go in and get one. Overall, I really can't complain much. The phone came turned off with a charger cable and was pre-wiped and ready to go. I had a little trouble getting the phone to take my SIM card, but it turns out that the phone wasn't the culprit - I needed to contact my service provider and give them the IMEI number for them to switch it over. After that, zero issues. METRO PCS USERS - YOU HAVE TO CALL METRO AND GIVE THEM THE IMEI NUMBER IN ORDER FOR YOUR SIM CARD TO WORK WITH THE PHONE.After activation, it was easy to sync up my account and I've had zero issues with the phone in the month or so I've had it. The screen is bright and really responsive, the biometric features are hit or miss - the Face Unlock really only works in the right light at the right angle, and I've had issues with the fingerprint reader, but I think that has more to do with the case I bought for the phone than the actual reader itself.In the time I've had the phone, there's been no crashes of the phone or any apps. The phone does get a little warm during heavy use, but nothing that I've felt I had to worry about. Charging happens pretty quickly with the cable - I'm planning to get a wireless charger soon - and the battery life is exceptional. Even after watching 3-4 hours of Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Disney + and Amazon Prime Video, the battery barely took a 15-20% hit. Power Saving settings, if properly utilized, can stretch the battery even more. I work nights and if the phone is fully charged when I leave, then during the 75 minute commute to and from work, heavy use during two 15 minute and a 30 minute break and a few hours beyond that, it's rare that I I make it home every morning with any less than 40-45%.All in all, this was a great purchase and I feel like I'm getting more than my money's worth.",2020年1月24日 在美国审核

Update - April 2020,"I just received my new ""refurbished"" Note 9 and I love it! It did come in mint condition, no scratches or damage to the phone at all. So far playing with the features and setting up have been a piece of cake; pretty similar to my previous Samsung Galaxy 5 so that made it easier to set up. I am awaiting a sim card that I needed to order in order to operate the phone with Straight Talk phone service. But I expect it to be fine.The only thing I wasn't too thrilled with is the new glass design, ""curved edges"". Sometimes when just touching the edge, it takes you somewhere that you didn't want to go to. Other than that it's great. I am appreciative that I was able to get one at a discounted price because I couldn't afford this phone new. So thank you!UPDATE: April 15th, 2020Phone has 2 speakers, one on top of phone and one on bottom. The top speaker keeps shutting off and on, therefore making it very difficult to hear at all times. ALSO, texting photos are taking a really long time to go through. I never had this problem with any of my other phones before. Wrote to seller about getting another one because, other than that, I still love the phone and everything else seems to work fine to date. For now I give it a four star. Will update to a 5 star again if all goes well after hearing and working with seller.",2020年4月4日 在美国审核

Good deal,"I was a bit concerned about buying a ""Renewed"" phone, especially after reading several complaints here about the phone not being truly unlocked, and still bound to a particular cellular service provider. Fortunately, my unit came without any such issues. After three days of digging into software, I couldn't find any info that could help identify the previous service vendor, if there was one. My current provider is Tmobile, and the phone seems to be happy to work on their network without any issues.Speaking of software, the phone came with android 9 ""Pie"" OS preinstalled, as well as the usual Samsung bloatware, but that's it. No vendor-specific apps.The package contained the phone (Snapdragon 845 version), charged to half capacity, a Samsung's charger and a noname USB type C cord. It's the bare minimum sufficient to get the phone up and running. The phone itself shows some evidence of prior usage (for which I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5): the sd/sim card door seems to have been opened at least several times, and there is a couple of microscopic scratches on the back near the fingerprint sensor.Not a deal breaker for sure, just a minor annoyance.Everything the phone is supposed to be doing it is doing with gusto. And yeah, it is still a great device. As a longtime Note user, I can appreciate how much the brand evolved over the years. The upgraded S-Pen is so useful in so many ways, I can't imagine how most people manage to live without it. Maybe Note9 is not as cutting edge as it was a year ago, butit is so well-rounded in terms of features and capabilities that it's hard to find any other phone that's clearly superior to it, even among newer ones.The only thing I really miss is the IR blaster, which was present on some earlier Notes. It seems that all phone manufacturers decided to ditch IR altogether, so I don't really have a choice in this regard.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, especially considering the price.",2019年7月6日 在美国审核

Good but...,"So the device itself seems to be working just fine. When it got here the phone was gross. It had something stuck on it as if someone handed it to a small child with sticky hands then stuck it in the box.It says it comes with a Sim card Key but didn't, no big deal I have extra.It came with a screen protector on which I thought oh hey cool. I'd already ordered new screen protectors and decided to add the new one anyway since this one had a few bubbles. Well it had the screen protector on to cover the pretty decent sized gouge in the screen. Deep enough that when I run my fingernail over it, it catches. So I wasn't happy about that.It was also supposed to be t-mobile phone but when I turned it on it said ATT but a paper said it was unlocked and explained how to reset the phoneso no big deal.Over all I still like this phone I just felt $250 for it's condition was a bit much. Hopefully it continues to work and I don't have any issues with it.",2021年11月5日 在美国审核

Looks and feels BRAND NEW! Came Unlocked and factory restored - Verizon User,"This review should be two fold: one for the Samsung Note 9 and second the quality of the condition of the phone itself from the seller. In the context of it being a used Amazon Renewed Phone, got to say, wow! It has exceeded my expectations on both fronts but most especially the quality of the condition the phone. I haven't detected a single scratch on the screen or edges. Battery life is holding strong - a real improvement from the note 8.Set up was a breeze - just popped my Verizon SIM card from my previous phone (Note 8), signed into google which automatically started downloading all of my apps, media, ect, with all of my custom settings and preferences fully intact, I might add. And bam. Within 30 minutes I was making calls.Now the samsung Note 9. It's an unbelievable phone. A true flag ship - and I couldn't believe it was available at under the $400 price point. I will definitely be doing this from now on - buying 1 year old flag ships on Amazon renewed. It's just an insane bargain for what your getting - one of the best phones ever made, with little to no signs of previous use.5-stars!",2020年3月3日 在美国审核

UPDATED - Almost all aftermarket parts broke within a year,"The phone is what I expected for refurbished. With close examination, I can see one ding around the speakers and four pinprick-sized spots of missing paint on the top and bottom edges. None of these irregularities are noticeable at a distance of a few inches and are completely hidden by the phone case. The stylus had a sticky smudge the size of a baby's pinky nail that cleaned up easily with a micro-fiber cloth and left no permanent marks.The phone itself is an excellent upgrade. I had a Galaxy 7 (not a Note) which worked okay but was dated. I had to install and re-install apps to get them to work correctly, so I upgraded to the Note 9. The battery life is MUCH improved. My old device was dead in less than 8 hours, but the Note 9 has gone 24 hours on a full charge and is only down to 51%.I don't know how much I can add to this review to make it meaningful, but if you were like me and looking to upgrade but is sitting on the fence, go ahead and do it. I saved approximately two hundred dollars by buying refurbished, and my refurbished model is like-new with hard-to-notice scuffs, and it a huge improvement over my old device.UPDATED: 1 Year LaterWithin a year the charging port and the camera failed. I took it into a shop to be repaired, and found that all the part that broke were aftermarket. Now, I knew receiving a phone with aftermarket parts was a possibility, but when they opened the device they found missing screws and clear wear and tear on the internal parts. I like the device and it's functionality, but ultimately I'm paying for repairs that cost 50% of what I actually paid for the device. And, of course, all these issues came up long after the 90-day warranty, but all of it happened within a year.Buyer beware.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核

Best Purchase Dollar for Dollar,"I have Metro PCS and I was very interested in buying a device compatible with my service features such as wi-fi calling and caller ID. Not to mention full capabilities to utilize network connectivity.I ordered two other Samsung devices, both International versions and I had issues with both (A50 and A70). Both stopped receiving text messages after a couple of days. Tech support wasn't able to figure it out, I read all the blogs online and concluded that international versions are not 100% compatible, hence why they're cheaper.Then I found this, I was debating between the OnePlus 7 PRO and the S10+, but I also didn't want to spend too much. Then I found this Tmobile Note 9, OnePlus wasn't a challenger due to the lack of micro sd slot. It is unlocked. It is a Tmobile phone. (Tmobile boot up) Pristine condition. (Zero blemishes) Battery works as it should. (I had this phone before brand new). It doesn't include an original Samsung fast charger. This doesn't bother me as I have plenty.For the price it's hands down the best phone you can get, this is a flag ship device. Waterproof, expandable memory, 4k 60fps quality video, super vivid screen. This phone was $1000 brand new just a few months ago. I can't even tell its used!

"Great buy, performs like new, but minor cosmetic damage","I bought this product about a month and a half ago. So far I am very happy with my purchase. I upgraded to this phone from a Samsung S7 Active. I was very cautious buying a ""Renewed"" smart phone. However, I was pleasantly surprised.But I want to make clear that the quality of the product could vary from seller to seller as it is not directly sold by Amazon but third party sellers who meet Amazon's specifications. My phone was sold by D'tech Mobile, and therefore your experiences my differ depending on your seller as other reviews suggest some are better than others in terms of quality. But keep in mind Amazon offers a decent 90 return/exchange policy.Anyway, as for the phone cosmetics, this is a used product so I wasn't expecting a pristine phone. The phone had a few small dents on the corners indicating it had been dropped from a short height on occasion. The front and back glass were very clean and mostly free of scratches. There were a few very minor scratches near the edges of the screen that were only really visible if the light hit the phone at the right angle. The S-pen was also in good condition but it was obvious that the previous owner heavily used the pen based on the wear on the writing tip. But the pen was still very usable, and any defect was hardly noticeable. With the case and screen protector on, you wouldn't be able to notice any of these minor flaws. I considered dropping to 4 stars because of this, but reconsidered as it is a used product after all and doesn't affect the overall experience of daily use.Now for the performance quality. The battery life was excellent. Part of the reason I upgraded was due to my previous phone's increasingly poor battery life. The battery life on this phone is excellent even used. I get a full day of heavy use, and two to two and a half days with casual use. The screen of the phone is top notch. The phone overall is very responsive. My previous phone had significant lag between inputs and seeing the action on screen. This phone lacks any such delay. The processor is very fast even with daily use though it is almost 2 generations old now. Side note: the phone is very large. I have large hands with long fingers and have issues reaching all corners of the screen with one hand. Keep that in mind if you have less than average sized hands.Also, several other reviews have claimed that their product was not unlocked. My phone was unlocked and worked on my AT&amp;T network. Keep in mind that this is a GSM phone, and therefore only works with GSM carriers (AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). Verizon and Sprint are CDMA carriers, and it seems most of the reviews that claimed in was not unlocked were for these carriers.TL;DR: Great quality for the price. Don't expect a new product, but rather a product that performs like new. Your experience may differ based on seller.",2020年5月21日 在美国审核

"Absolutely great phone, but is still a used phone!","Love my new ""renewed"" Galaxy Note 9 phone, Samsung finally did the Note series right! This phone is fast, has lots of memory,has a large screen, great features and performance,s pen, water resistant,easily expands with up to a 500gb micro sd card.. I've loaded every app I ever wanted into my phones 128 memory and still have 85+ GB. Then I bought a 256gb sd card, (Samsung also),and downloaded another 13gb of Music Cds onto it. Absolutely no lag when scrolling through my CD list. Battery life if also fantastic. So far I've used it all day and all night long and still have 30 to 60 % battery life, at the end of the day.Still not used to the fact that I may not need to bring my charger along with me to work.. The price was great also, but the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars,is because it is advertised as T mobile GSU, ""renewed"", the phone I received was clearly used, the screen has a few scratches and the back and edges also have scratches and pits. Plus the phone was set to AT&amp;T. I was able to insert my T mobile sim card and T mobile came up fine. The only reference to AT&amp;T was after a restart.The startup symbol appears for a sec and then disappears, with T-mobile logo on top.",2020年1月29日 在美国审核
Fastest phone I have ever used on Verizon prepay [4.5 stars],"Crystal clear phone calls, voice to text is the best on this phone out of any phone I have ever owned in my life.<br><br>Blackberry KeyOne can choke on it! I've run with Blackberry for the last few years, they did a replacement upgrade when my phone was lost at the FedEx or UPS warehouse, and let me keep it as a backup when it was recovered. So service seemed great, but recently I had to roll back bc my replacement phone has been breaking down. I transferred everything to my original KeyOne only to discover they never actually repaired the phone when it was in for repair. Neither of these phones ever did voice to text correctly.Years ago, I had a Samsung Note 3, which I loved. It was a durable, high quality phone, that didn't slip through your hands. Only problem is, when networks moved beyond 3G, it became pretty worthless. If there was an upgrade option for wireless networks in phones, then I probably would not have stopped using it before this year.Unlike the Note 3, the Note 9 is a slippery phone, so you need a solid protective case. I bought a stack of cases with the phone to try out and my favorite is the Zizo Bolt Series with detachable belt hook. - Brilliant design and durable enough that I feel safe using this phone with that case.. I'll be doing a youtube video on the cases in a few weeks.. look for Joseph Pahrle to watch it.Overall, I'm just amazed by how fast this phone pulled all my apps in. It had every app from my old phone loaded before I walked in the door of the grocery store down the street. It was the fastest upgrade I have ever had in a smart phone. Absolutely love this phone!/!\ update.. photos are very good, but video stabilization is very weak. If they added 5-axis image stabilization to this phone, then it would be perfect!</br></br>",2020年6月3日 在美国审核

4g doesn't work but I can make phone calls....,"Excited for something new but I feel I was fooled, I thought I ordered the unlocked version but for reason I failed ..I guess.

But I tried to remain optimistic and go to set up phone and hear the t mobile chime, this was upsetting but again in a negative world I strive for positivity. So I continue thesetup things are looking good I’m feeling good, I make a call it works so no problem I can deal with the bloat ware.

"Phone marked as ""stolen"" in Verizon's database - can't be activated","I purchased the Verizon unlocked version of this phone.They sent me the fully ""factory"" unlocked version of the phone.I thought this wasn't a problem - should be able to swap my sim card.My sim card was the wrong size, so I took the phone to Verizon to get a new sim, and they said they couldn't activate the new phone because it was marked as ""stolen"" in their database.They confirmed that the phone was unlocked and COULD be activated by Verizon if it weren't marked as stolen.I know it's a gamble purchasing refurbished items, but I didn't expect an Amazon certified seller and refurbisher to be selling stolen phones.That's why I shop on Amazon rather than eBay.Good think Amazon backs this with their return policy.I'll be getting a refund.",2020年7月30日 在美国审核

Great Customer Service- please read details!,"Updated! Went from 1 star to 5 star..<br>So the phone was in excellent condition However it could not be activated on T-Mobile due to it was blocked on T-Mobile because it had an outstanding balance due!Apparently whoever had the phone before owes a balance on the actual phone and on their bill. Therefore it could not be activated so after Many many hours of troubleshooting as to why I could not get signal to make/receive any phone calls or text messages found out I was not able to activate it. I'm sure there is a way to know this before the seller is actually selling the phone.I probably should have gone with a seller that had higher ratings but I like to give everybody a chance because you gotta start somewhere however this was a major inconvenience of waiting for the phone, the troubleshooting and only to be let down that it could not be used.It was a Samsung Galaxy note 9 in Lavender 128 GB unlocked T-Mobile phone. I was refunded upon sending back. I took a gamble again, not knowing it was the same company that I ordered from b4. This time instead of ordering an unlocked T-Mobile phone, I ordered a 'T-Mobile' phone- or so I thought.. This one was a Samsung phone (not locked to Any company) which was still having problems with, wouldn't update on T-Mobile system -although once again in excellent condition... I reached out to seller and said that I needed not an 'unlocked' not a 'Samsung' only brand but a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 9 phone. AsSoon as I returned the phone they sent me out or replacement and I have not had any problems since! No balances were due, it was a factory T-Mobile Samsung phone. Updates are working fine along with network.My problem for not being very specific with the seller &amp; my purchase.. I give them a 5 for Customer Service &amp; a excellent condition of all 3 phones that were sent!Hope this review helped :)</br>",2020年2月23日 在美国审核

Unlocked as advertised,"I bought this phone for my younger sister who doesn't live in the United States. The phone functions well, and it is definitely unlocked. She placed her non-American Number in the phone and was able to set up the phone with ease. She only had the phone for 3 weeks so far, but she has no problem with the device.The phone came in great condition, no scratches, and not much notible scuffs. Looks pretty new. The phone is getting 4 stars because it didn't come with an original charging cord, earphones, and some other items that would normally come with the phone. It came with a generic charging cord, original wall plug, the stylist pen, and a metal pin to open the slot for your sim &amp; SD card.The generic cord stop working after the first week. So I recommend buying other accessories for the phone separately.",2020年1月8日 在美国审核
Fantastic New Phone!,My Galaxy S5 finally let me know it was time to retire.I bought this phone after careful consideration and comparison.The one that lost is the S8 Active.It lost only because of its age.This phone is brand new in the box!If it was previously owned it was never used or taken out of the box!This machine is fantastic!The fingerprint reader is a dream.I have 4 finger prints loaded into it - two from each hand so I can unlock with ease or use the pattern to unlock.Speed and memory are leaps ahead of my S5!!I think this is by far the best looking phone I've ever had.WIth an Otter Box Defender (knock off) case and a tempered glass screen protector I'm all set to go.I should have done this sooner!Excellent purchase!,2021年10月20日 在美国审核

Exactly what I wanted!!,"After almost 6 months of trying to figure out exactly what kind of one I wanted and watching YouTube reviews on countless phones,I decided to buy the Samsung note 9 and decided to give a try with buying a phone from amazon. I made sure to read the reviews on countless of the options amazon had for the note 9 and settled on this one, and let me tell you I am not disapointed!!!I am absolutely in love and very pleased with what I received.Despite some reviews claiming the pen and charger were bad quality I think they may have since fixed that issue because my pen and charger are both samsung and work fine. The phone is in perfect condition no scratches and even had a screen protector on it. I took the phone to metro to have my service switched over from my old phone and the guy mentioned it had 2 screen protectors on it? Heck I don't mind either way it was a nice surprise I'm clumsy, lol. The guy even said ""wow this is a really nice phone"". Overall not a single complaint thank you to the seller!!!!

Love my upgrade from Note 3 to Note 9,"I love the quality of this phone, especially considering it was refurbished. It came like brand new, no blemishes I could see. Worked perfectly. I was able to get it set up on a mobile phone plan with no problems at all. It takes some time getting used to the new type of pen and how to get it out (press to pop it out like a button instead of just yanking it out like older models). But i love the screen size, the art apps, and the camera is EXCELLENT quality. I feel like this is a solid phablet hybrid that can help me with any of my creative projects. I use it every day to take pictures, draw, use Adobe mobile applications, take notes, write to do lists and shopping lists, make calls, and watch YouTube. I would highly recommend this phone to any artistic person or anyone who loves previous Galaxy Note phones. I'm not a super technical person so I couldn't offer any comparisons between Galaxy S9, and all the other versions in the newest Galaxy lineup.

"Phone scratched, missing items, seller didn't respond","The phone did not meet Amazon's renewed item standards.It has scratches and mars visible from 12"" away.I am traveling so it's about impossible to exchange it and see if the next one is better, so I'm living with it.Luckily they aren't terrible scratches and I'm not a perfectionist any more.Also, the listing says only the headphones are not included, but the extra pen nibs, nib remover, cover, and usb-c to usb-a connector were not in the box as they should have been.Amazon says all original items are included unless specified in the listing.I wrote the seller about the missing items and received no response.It's not a deal breaker, I'm glad to have the phone. It just out of integrity.Buyer be informed.Also, mine is a Verizon phone. A note in the box said to ignore that and be assured it is unlocked. I ended up with Verizon, so I could not test how easy it was to use another provider.As for the phone, I like the way you can write on the screen without unlocking it. I do this for taking quick notes, especially for dream recall.I am not a fan of the curved edge, it's more trouble than helpful.You can't use a normal screen protector.I still haven't put my fancy $50 curved glass one on because I'm nervous I will do it wrong or it will look horrible.It is a bit slippery and narrow to hold.I like some of the new interface elements but that bixby button is a bit of a pain, getting hit by mistake every day.The battery can last days of you put it in minimal function mode.I had a note 3 before that was having too many problems with GPS and slow speed so I finally gave it up.I'm grateful I was able to get a refurbished upgrade.",2020年2月3日 在美国审核
Its great!,"I love it! The Note 9 is already a great phone, but getting a refurbished one for waaay cheaper made it all the more worth it.

There was only a tiny tiny scuff , but i am not picky, especially since it's on the back and i use a case anyway. Plus, the have a 60 return policy, so if the is something wrong with it it can be returned!",2019年2月21日 在美国审核
Excellent condition and unlocked.,"Buying used (or ""renewed"") phones is always a gamble, but it definitely paid off for me. The phone I received was indeed factory unlocked, and in even better condition than I was expecting. It had a very, very tiny chip on the bottom corner, a few barely visible scratches on the back, and some slight dirt/scratching around the outside of the USB-C port. The S-pen was also in good condition, and the correct color, but the tip (nib) was worn down a bit. A fast charger and cable also came in the box, both in excellent condition. While the phone didn't have anyone's account or info on it, it had already been through the initial setup. The first thing I did was a factory reset, which should ALWAYS be the first thing you do on a new phone.As for the phone itself... I couldn't be happier! After hearing that the new Moto G Stylus wouldn't have NFC, and a decidedly worse pen, I went for the Note 9. It's probably the best phone purchase I've ever made. Even though it's several years old now, it still beats the 2020 Motorola budget phones in performance for just $60 more (used).It has a headphone jack, unlike the Note 10, and I actually prefer having some empty space on the top and bottom of the screen to host the camera and speaker, as opposed to a hole-punch or notch. The battery easily lasts me 2 days at half brightness, at the highest resolution. Speaking of resolution, there are three options: 720p, 1080p, and 1440p. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in battery life between 1080 and 1440, but I also can't see any real difference in quality between the two. Both options look fantastic. The screen can get incredibly dim, and also incredibly bright. There are two speakers, one on each side of the phone. They sound good, however, only the top speaker is on the front of the phone (facing you), while the other is on the bottom (next to charging port) and can be muffled by your hand while holding the phone sideways. Tons of storage space, plus expandable storage if you have an SD card to spare. NFC (Google pay/Samsung pay) is supported, unlike most similarly priced budget phones. Wireless charging is nice and allows charging even if the USB-C port fails or breaks later on. The fingerprint scanner is quick and works great.The 12-megapixel camera is the biggest negative for this phone in 2020. Good enough for day to day use and even vacation photos, but the real draw (ha) is the pen, not the camera. Secondly, the battery can't be replaced without removing the entire front panel of the phone, which is made intentionally difficult. Not uncommon these days, but a negative nonetheless.The pre-installed Samsung apps aren't too intrusive, and I replace most of them with Google alternatives. The same can't be said for Bixby or the Bixby home. Luckily, you can disable the Bixby home screen, and you can now re-bind the Bixby button to open a different app, or open nothing at all! Facebook can't be uninstalled, but you can ""disable"" it, which is good enough.The S-pen is incredible. I didn't realize just how versatile the pen was before I purchased it, but I'm so glad I did. It has pressure sensitivity, a tiny button on one side of the pen, and even tilt detection! It's an active pen, so it communicates it's position and angle to the phone when held close to the screen, showing a dot or text cursor depending on the context. It can be set to disable finger presses when detected, so you can safely place your hand on the screen while drawing without causing issues! It essentially IS a drawing tablet, albeit quite small. It is far superior to a capacitive pen, like what the Moto G Stylus has, which doesn't have any of these features. The main downside is that the pen has a capacitor that needs to be charged. It's not a huge issue as it can be fully charged in 40 seconds (by simply inserting it into the phone), and lasts 15-30 minutes per charge. - Worth noting, mine did NOT come with extra pen tips (nibs), and the only way to get official replacements is to buy a new pen from Samsung (on Amazon) for $30. (Pen purchase comes with 1 additional soft tip and 1 additional hard tip). Or, you can go for a possibly less-than-quality Chinese replacement set for ~$5. If you are using a screen protector, the cheap ones should be fine.- Some sellers may be better than others. My phone came from CellGuru and they get a +1 from me.- I highly recommend a case and screen protector, as both sides of this phone are covered in glass. I also specifically recommend a glass screen protector instead of film/plastic. My film protector added lots of resistance when using the S-pen, to the point of being unusable for drawing.",2020年2月17日 在美国审核

Great phone at a great price,"Phone arrived promptly in absolutely perfect condition. Not a scratch or a blemish of any kind. Only minor quibble was that it only came with a sim card tray removal tool. No charger or charging cord. Not a big deal as we have a bunch of them anyway. Brought it to our Verizon store and they popped in a sim card and it was up and running perfectly. Used Samsung Smart Switch to move over everything from the old phone to the new one. So my wife now has all of her text threads, photos, settings, passwords and apps. Couldn't be any happier. Battery life is ridiculously great and the screen is bright and clear.Edit: my wife was about to throw out the box it came in and guess what? There was the charger and USB-C cord! It's a cheap aftermarket charger that doesn't do fast charge, but they did provide a charger. So this has been a perfect purchase. Couldn't be happier. Kudos to Amazon.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核
Quality will change depending on what seller you buy from and how lucky you are.,"Quality and choice of service provider vary greatly depending on the seller but all of them are pretty similar. Look for sellers who have at least a few thousand reviews and are above 85 percent positive for your best chance at a great phone with your choice of service provider. I got lucky and ordered a Verizon but got an unlocked, so it's really all just a chance thing. Also if you get the wrong phone, or a broken one, you can just ship it back and get a full refund within 3 days.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核

"Phone Arrived Clean, Nearly Perfect, Activated on Verizon Wireless Without Issue","I've been using this ""renewed"" Samsung Galaxy Note9 for a little over one month.It has worked without any problems and activated on Verizon wireless using the SIM card from my old VZW phone without any issues.I never had to contact VZW, it just worked the way it should once I put in the SIM card.The only criticism I have is that there is a clearly observable scratch on the right side of the screen close to the edge bend near the middle.The scratch is about 3/16"" long and is definitely visible from more than 12-inches away and therefore I don't think the phone was properly classified by the vendor as to condition.There is also a small scratch on the bottom of the phone, but this is minimal and I think it's within the grading classification given to the phone.So, all told I'm happy with the phone and I think I'd buy it again.A previous Note9 I purchased through another vendor went straight back for a refund when it arrived with a facacta power button that was incredibly soft and would clearly fail in short order.",2020年3月29日 在美国审核

But it should work just fine. My friend has this phone and I already know that it's quite fantastic if I have any issues all update my review.

Mostly great phone,"I bought a used Galaxy Note 9 from Celltraders. When I buy used, I always research the seller. You should always do that, ofc, but especially for used tech. As it turns out, I got a great phone but with one detail that's not as bad for me as it may be for others.First off, it was listed as locked to AT&amp;T, so I got exactly what I expected.My Note 9 was almost perfect. I mostly use my phone for gaming, videos, texting, and social media. All of that was awesome. Gorgeous details and screen. Great pics. Good sound out of the speakers. Lots of space because I got the 512gb version. Oddly enough, I rarely use it as an actual phone, which is why it took me a few days to realize the sound was a little tinny.To the person I'm talking to, everything sounds fine. But what I hear is off. It's not soft and it doesn't effect my ability to understand what's being said, but I've heard regular Galaxy 9s and it's not the same. That being said, it did take me a few days to actually use it as a phone and by that time, I'd set up everything the way I wanted. So I kept it and I have no regrets.Had I noticed the issue as soon as I got the phone, I may have tried to return it. But with the price a paid I'm happy.",2021年3月4日 在美国审核

High Quality Complicated Flagship,"Several years ago I bought a Galaxy Note 3. Great phone, never had a problem. Used it for several years. Everyone at work had an iPhone and since I work in IT, I thought I should get an iPhone so I would know how to use it. So I reluctantly shut down my Note3 and picked up an iPhone 6s. I really liked it but it was kind of small and somewhat limited- really nice phone overall though. What I liked most about the iPhone (besides the really slick GUI and the lightning cable) was that it was equipped with an NFC. I found I could use it to pay for just about everything. After a while though I grew tired of the whole iTunes thing and my eye began wandering. It landed on a MotoG7 which is really nice for a mid range phone. Runs crisply and reliably and has a lot of MOTO features that give it a very user friendly vanilla Android 9.0 experience. As of late, with the CoVid -19 onslaught, I began not really wanting to use my debit card and enter a PIN on some PIN pad at every store I went to. So I again went looking for a phone that had NFC, a good size with a vivid screen, and wireless charging. Samsung wants premium prices for their flagship phones so I looked for a phone with the features I wanted for the least amount of money. The Note9 fits the bill perfectly! I run my phones on the Ting network so I called them and they sent me a SIM immediately. I ordered this Renewed GSM Note9 and am thrilled with it. It ticks all the boxes and then some. It runs really well and has a very vivid display. The camera takes clear and brilliant pics. And... it has the NFC!! There is quite a learning curve with this phone. Samsung's OneUI overlay gives incredible flexibility, but it feels like it's trying to do too many things, too many notifications, too many reminders. But again, all of those things can be turned off and adjusted as needed. I ordered the phone on a Saturday and it arrived by Tuesday! This is significant since Amazon has been slammed by the pandemic and was showing a 3-4 week delivery window. Overall, great price, fast delivery, fantastic phone (literally looks and runs like new!!). It's good to have a Note in the stable again.",2020年4月9日 在美国审核

Beware of the Microphone,"I love everything about this phone except the fact that the microphone doesn't work.Everything else about the phone is fantastic, but if you want to talk on the phone, record sound, use text to speak features or anything of that nature, the microphone is so low you won't be able to.These features work fine if you have a headset or if you're using Bluetooth for phone calls, but it's irritating.Evidently, this is something that is a particular issue with a number of Galaxy Note 9 phones, so be aware of this before you purchase it. If it wasn't such a pain to go back through the process of getting a new phone, I would have returned it and found another one.As it is, it's manageable if you carry a headset everywhere you go.It's also such a large phone that you really need something to carry it in.Since the front and back are reportedly made of glass, please make sure you get a reliable case.Even with the case I purchased, I'm still looking for a clutch to carry the phone, as I previously had a purse/wallet that held my former Galaxy.I am sure I'll find something soon!",2019年11月8日 在美国审核

"Excellent phone bought through OCrack, no drama","I love my new (to me) phone! It's been a while since I bought my previous used phone, and some of the reviews had me a bit scared when I was looking through the Note9 listing. I bought my phone through the seller O'Crack and it's worked out. Arrived when they said it would. I was a little confused when I turned it on and a Tmobile logo came up, but the seller quickly responded to my email to let me know that it was unlocked, they just tested it with the networks before sending the phone out. Once I put in the sim card it was good to go and no issues with the transfer. Phone is in excellent condition, with no flaws that I can notice. Again I recommend this seller. And whether your experience is good or bad, make sure to state which seller you bought from in your reviews because it seems like reviews for different sellers were clumped together in this product page so some people had wildly different experiences depending on which seller they got.",2020年8月12日 在美国审核

Sprint is NOT T-Mobile when it comes to LOCKED phones!!,"Looks like a good phone to replace my aging Galaxy 11 that has problems processing stuff as of late. Ordered the T-Mobile compatible Samsung Note 9, specifically as a T-Mobile compatible service phone. Phone arrived within a week, so no problems there. Charged it up, and then turned on power to see the screen options. When it did boot up to the home screen, and I saw a Sprint Icon, I knew there was a problem.Although T-Mobile and Sprint are now 1, their phones are not. What was once a propriety Sprint cell phone, is still a Sprint Locked phone, and cannot be unlocked by T-Mobile. Taking it to my local T-Mobile store for help, and having a new SIM card inserted (as mine from my older phone did not work in the new Sprint phone), and trying again, did not help. Showed them my Amazon order, and the shipping box, both showed I ordered a T-Mobile compatible phone, but that was not the case. If you are selling something as a T-Mobile compatible product, you better make sure it is what you are selling it as, and not another brand. That is false advertising, or stupidity, on the sellers behalf.",2021年9月12日 在美国审核

Just like new,"Item came well-packed and in perfect condition. Even the protective plastic was still present on the edges and camera. I am not sure if this phone was ever used. Just as promised, the phone is carrier-free and unlocked. Not a mark or fingerprint on it.Everything is in perfect working order; the mic, camera, speaker.Do note: It only comes with the phone &amp; pen, a charging cord, charging block, and sim tool. Not the headphones, pen tips or other accessories that are bundled with a new phone. If you need those items, you may be just as well to buy new. If not, save yourself some money.I use T-Mobile. The phone recognized my SIM card and registered on the network instantly. I did not have to go through any extra hoops to connect to LTE+ or use my WiFi calling. I didn't even have to contact customer service to make sure the phone was properly recognized. Phew! The Android Pie update just got pushed to the Note 9 and it makes the phone feel even slicker.As for the phone: I am blown away by the battery life and UI improvements over my previous Note 5. I am not a heavy gamer but I do put a lot of strain on the phone with research, camera use, and design programs. The phone is large for my small hands, but there are a lot of ways to control the phone with one hand and voice. I am smitten with the remote control pen. I can get shake-free pics of my art and tiny things. The fingerprint recognition is hugely improved over the Note 5, it works every time, whether my hands are cold or have been in the water. The UI has added a lot of features I normally use 3rd party apps to change; such as an overall dark theme and improved Samsung keyboard. I highly recommend buying the app ""bxActions"" Button Remapper to remap the Bixby button to be more useful.I had an issue with the phone's charging block and the seller got back to me within hours to say they are shipping me a replacement. If you have any kind of issue this seller is fast, friendly, and happy to work with you. Would recommend!",2019年3月22日 在美国审核

Great phone,"The phone I ordered arrived in mint condition, not a scratch ding or scuff. It had an original Samsung fast charger. Works perfectly.

During the initial setup it asks for the SIM card,after completing it will still show as a N960U1 (T-Mobile is N960U) and will not have the T-Mobile software. However the VOLTE and WI-FI calling all still work on the T-Mobile network with a T-Mobile SIM. Overall very happy with the phone especially the battery life which is excellent.

"Great refurbished phone, ordered from re-cell","To start off, the Samsung galaxy note 9 is a massive upgrade from the Samsung galaxy note 3 that I had before which started dying of natural causes.A few things to note, this is my first refurbished phone, and as of writing this review I have had this phone for about a month.Upon opening the box I did an initial scan of the camera, screen and casing. The camera worked fine and didn’t have any scratches or issues. The screen did not have any scratches or blemishes and had a mirror like finish from a very lightly used or heavy duty screen protector. There were no cracks or defects anywhere except for the lower left corner, like it was dropped from a low height onto a jagged surface like side walk concrete; and the s pen was in used condition. Other than those two defects I could have sworn this phone was brand new never before used (based on appearance)The box from re-cell came with a charging cord, a well-used usb outlet plug (not an issue as it is now my new travel charger where it will get scratched up anyways), headphones with a mic (don’t know the quality as I haven’t used them, it’s just a plus to have them included.The packaging was really stylish it was a satin black with a shiny logo for re-cell. Inside everything was tightly packed to prevent movement when shipping and a note with an email to contact if there were any issues. There were none but it was nice to have the option.A month later after getting used to a new phone I can say there are no issues, it was a risk in my mind to buy a refurbished and based on a lot of review it is a risk. But I will say re-cell was a pleasure to buy from.",2020年2月26日 在美国审核

Great but NOT PERFECT,"Considering the price point for a brand new Note 9 is near a grand from nearly any retailer this is a steal!My experience so far has been a good one, Note 9 came UNLOCKED in a UNMARKED box that contained the phone, an official samsung wall adapter and cable.My gripes are that the cable that came with it broke when I used it only ONCE, yeah ONCE. So I want to warn anyone buying this to be careful with the provided cable.Thankfully the phone came with no scratches or any visible damage! The only downside being that the screen is burned in only slightly from whoever the previous owner was or Amazon charging it and leaving the display on (can only be noticed with shades of gray and not any other color).Other than that, the phone runs great!",2019年12月11日 在美国审核
"Great phone, a few surprises, but a good unit for me personally!","This is a south korean telecom phone that's unlocked, and capable of working on my Mint network just fine!This was a surprise, but after some app disabling, as well as some tweaking of the UI, I think this will be good for me in the long run.This phone has an OEM UNLOCK toggle, so I think I'll be able to flash this phone with custom Android 11 &amp;12 builds someday down the road.One other minor complaint: it came with the grey spen, not the yellow one that comes with this color phone model.That's ok, though- I'll probably buy a new one someday, and that's an awfully minor thing to complain about.Phone works great!

"Practically mint condition, unlocked, and works flawlessly!","I got my renewed Note 9 specifically from the seller ReFoned. The phone is basically brand-new, I can't find a single blemish, the battery is great, and it has the original (bluetooth) S-Pen. I was confused about whether or not it was actually GSM unlocked, explained below.As for the Note 9, I'm really glad I picked this phone. Upgrading from a Moto G3, this was quite an improvement. I'm also really satisfied by the S-Pen, I find myself using the phone significantly more often and for heavier-duty tasks, in part because I hate touch screens (oily hands all over the *screen*? insanity) but the pen means I never have to touch it. Plus, I find myself using it to draw pretty often, since the pressure sensitivity is pretty good even through a film screen protector. Two great bonuses about the Note 9 compared to newer models: No notch or holepunch in the screen for the camera, and it has a headphone jack.The rest of the review is informative, in case you (like me) are confused by whether the phone is unlocked or not:When I first put in my SIM card (from an AT&amp;T reseller), I got the notification ""SIM card is not from Verizon Wireless"", and it came pre-installed with Verizon bloatware, despite me specifically choosing the ""GSM Carriers"" version of the phone.However, all I had to do to get my SIM card to work was go into [Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile networks &gt; Access Point Names &gt; Add], and then fill out the APN according to my carrier's information (just Google your carrier + APN to get the info for yours). Now it works fine with 4G LTE, calling, and texting, and I disabled all of the Verizon apps.The phone is absolutely flawless now. I was worried before purchasing, but I picked out a seller that looked promising and replied to clear up negative reviews on their page, and I'm glad I did. I'm seriously impressed by how great the condition is, for way cheaper than buying new and much safer than buying used elsewhere.",2021年8月25日 在美国审核
Quality...ish.,"The phone has had no problems at all yet, but the problem I have is the inside of the camera glass is dirty. That's not something you can simply wipe away, I'd have to pay money or return it to get it cleaned. It's fairly annoying, it's not a small amount &amp; it's under both cameras. There's also a substance under the heart reader thing that looks like.. dried milk? but it doesn't seem to effect the camera quality &amp; I don't have the time or money to be able to drop ~$70 to get it replaced, so it'll just have to exist like that for now. Having a good amount of dust inside the camera glass could potentially make the camera inoperable if it tried to focus on the dust or obscured vision.

Not original S Pen,The phone came quickly and the overall look was fantastic. After working with the phone I noticed the S pen was not working for air commands. I let the seller D'Tech Mobile know of the issue. They replied with a canned response about reconditioned phones. The S pen is an integral part of the phone unlike a charger or cable. Without a solution the phone will be returned. There are a ton of resellers that satisfy their customers.*Update* The company reached out to me and presented a solution to the issue. I am still waiting on the promised credit; I am adjusting my star rating.,2020年12月11日 在美国审核

Perfect,"Ok realistic review. Quality 10. Battery life 8. Storage 10. Speed 10. Shipping 10. Accessories 10. Speakers 9. Start up 10. Oke everything about this phone is pretty well awesome. I gave battery an 8. I am on my phone none stop all day for work. It lasts about 10-12 hours from full to dead. That's with music streaming about 6 hours onto of my normal activity. Came with all name brand power cord and headphones. Pin works great. Camera is phenomenal. Hard drive was actually the 500gb not the 128gb that I ordered. No complaints!

Only a single microscratch on the screen, the pen works great, some of the paint is chipped on the side (covered by the case anyways). I upgraded from my good ol' S7Edgefrom 2015, so this is a massive improvement. As specified in the product's description, the charging cord is just a cheap replacement, but who cares.

The other complaint is the back glass, which has cracked twice now since I've owned it a little over a month, with no dropping of the phone whatsoever. I don't know if it was a faulty glass from the factory, or if the Otterbox I had on the phone was causing some sort of pressure related stress on the back, but now that I've switched cases I don't have any new cracks to report.

The no compromises device.,"All in all, it's a great device. Compared to some of the newer phones and newer technologies that are out there you'll have slightly slower responses.

But if you're looking for a phone that does it all and doesn't break your bank this is the one for you. It's got all of the features that you could ever want in a phone. Software/hardware wise, if you want to do it this phone probably has a way to make it happen.

I love buying renewed phones.,"Whenever I buy a used product, I always expect some kind of defect that would justify the price I'm paying for it. This is the third used phone I've bought over the past four years and this phone was the best of them all. The phone looks new and was unlocked with no carrier branding or bloatware. The slight discoloration around the camera rim is the only sign that the phone was pre owned. Everything else is perfect on the phone.

DON'T BE PICKY ABOUT THE PHONE,I bought my phone from GSM PROS cus I am sure amazon mixes reviews. The only thing my phone had a scratch on the screen but i put a glass protector on. now its like new and yes it did have pre-loaded app from AT&amp;T but disable them and they disappear. Look if you going to buy used phone for sometimes $300 less then brand new and complain about apps just save for a brand new phone. Also for me it did not come with the original charger or box with accessories. I had an S8 before this so i didn't care they come with the same crap. Although if you really want that stuff go to Mecari or something. they have the original box and all accessories for like $20. So basically just make sure it has any actual S-pen mine did come with one. Also check the IEM number to make sure it a real brand not some knock off one but if AT&amp;T is on it that says something already. Finally just test it with like the service you use and test it with others to make sure if you ever change service it will work there too.,2019年12月25日 在美国审核

Works great, I only gave four stars because the speaker on my phone is busted it's works but you can hear it's muffled. This would be a big deal for a lot of people but I use the fake air pods ( which are pretty good too) and my phone is always on vibrate anyways.So all in all I am very happy with my purchase, and am glad I did not get ripped off.

Read the Description.,"Galaxy note 9 Ocean Blue,Purchased from Wireless Experts, Inc.The product is true, everything works fine.My intentions were to use the phone with sprint, when it arrived, it was originally through T-Mobile (no big deal) upon further research the device is GSM Network only and for those who know Sprint &amp; Verizon use CDMA networks,Therefore I cannot use this device with sprint. Only with GSM Service providers (ex: T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, etc..)BEFORE BUYING:Learn what NETWORK works for your service provider (GSM or CDMA) and read the sellers description on the device carefully. If your still skeptical, contact the seller and test before delivery.IF YOU ALREADY PURCHASED:a quick google search“How to check CDMA or GSM” will verify what networks you can use. Test before returning.Conclusion:Don’t rush your purchase, this is Amazon third party territory.

Camera is insultingly good,"I love the speed. Compared to my Galaxy S7 this is a dream. The screen size is big but doesn't feel ""too big"".

Really crisp images, can't wait to play around with editing pictures again. Which is the reason I got the phone in the first place. The built in s-pen is better than any stylus you could buy for a phone. This one came with a clearly used too, but that's not a deal breaker. There were also a few very small and barely noticable nicks on the back of the phone under the back plate. Also not a deal breaker. Given the price, and that this is an unlocked phone, meaning no TMobile bloatware, this phone is 10/10. I didn't give a full 5 stars because while the batter is much better than my last phone, it's still not impressively good. Face recognition took maybe 5 attempts to recognize me to register my face.

Once my refund showed, I purchased this one that was VERIZON notated in the Listing, and it was unlocked. I had no issues setting it up with Verizon.I bought this phone because I was looking for an upgraded Note phone--mine was failing fast--and I chose this one.CONS:What I didn't notice in time of the (Limited refurb warranty) was that I can NOT get my images off my phone using the cord. I have turned off the preset features, tried all the recommended suggestions and it's not working. I am sincerely disappointed in that because I do take a lot of pictures and I will have to email them to myself until I can get a cloud backup (not using google) to transfer them to my computer. THAT SUCKS...The other thing I'm NOT happy about is when I use the phone on speaker. It is causing problems on the other end of the line and people can't hear me or it has bad reverb. So I have to use a bluetooth headset to make it work.IT leads me to believe this is probably what was wrong with THIS phone when it was refurbished and that refurb techs didn't fix that OR it's not fixable.PROS: it takes really nice pictures, and the rest of the phone works as it should.

Love it,So i have had this phone for over a year. I alwasy buy my phones full price because its cheaper and I can own it and do what I want with it. I cracked the screen after a month but got it fixed. The operating system is fast and nice. It comes with a lot of internal memory but I also put my SD card in it.

Worked for the 90 day trial and then quit,"This phone has been nothing but trouble since the 90 day return period ended. I have tried with two different carriers with the result that calling and texting are spotty to non existent depending on location. The company that refurbished it shipped it with a broken stylus that was taped together with clear tape. The email that I sent to them went unanswered. It's a real shame because I like the phone and the features it has, but just have not been able to make it work as advertised.

"As described!  Unlocked, in great shape.  Recommended item","Phone arrived well packaged with a USB c cable and fast charger.Completely unlocked and bored up just as it should.There were only a couple very minor flaws that would not show when using a case (as I am).The battery life seems decent enough but obviously it wasn't replaced which is somewhat disappointing considering the cost of this item compared with other used note 9's.There was a pre-installed screen protector though which was quite a nice surprise.Overall I'd give it a 4.5/5, only holding back 1/2 star for the somewhat unimpressive battery life.I would definitely recommend this seller.This is my first time buying a used or refurbished phone and if this is the norm I would certainly do it again!",2020年5月10日 在美国审核

WOW - Amazon Refurb is the way to go!  Just 1 small gripe (charger cable),"I was a little sketched out buying a used phone but figured it was worth a shot since Amazon warrantees your purchase for 90 days AND they're guaranteed to look like new.All I can say is WOW - mine very much did look brand new and I absolutely cannot tell it apart from a factory sealed phone fresh out of the box.In fact, still had the plastic on the front screen and bezels - maybe this is something this particular seller provides but I was surprised... nice touch.It was factory unlocked as promised.All I needed to do was install my VZW SIM and a spare 128GB micro-SD I had lying around and power it on.It was connected, up and running in under 5 minutes.Battery is 95% healthy according to the Ampere app, stylus works perfect and I couldn't be happier minus one caveat - the charger.It's clearly called out in the listing that 'it may not include the original charger' but the charger I received does not really work.It doesn't fast charge at all - mainly because the USB-USBC cable is junk.The wall plug itself is ok (Qualcomm PD 3.0) but the cable sucks and also does not carry data (tested on multiple devices).I ended up buying a set of USBC fast charger cables + a wireless fast charger w/next day shipping, so it wasn't a big deal... but my gripe is that the listing says accessories are 'fully functional'.Oh well - minus one star on that but the PHONE ITSELF and the Refurb program both get a full 5.",2020年11月11日 在美国审核

"Great Device, with two minus","So purchased this phone on 8/21/2020,Its a great upgrade from my S8+, better battery, camera, ram, processes, and already upgraded to android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 right out of the box, and soon UI 2.5 when released ""Showing that Samsung will support the Note 9 and the S9 and 9+ for those that are wondering for one more upgrade.The one came with everything that was mention acharging cable and brick and a preinstalled screen protector.Cosmetically the phone back and front glass looks brand new, but the side aluminum railing looks worn especially near the charge port and one corner which made me think that maybe phone was dropped at one point previously ""Reason i am giving it a 4 starts a little worn in those charge ports and i would give a 5 but it has significant paint missing near the charge port""Phone was a UNLOCKED model which many people complained about, which a lot of people complained they did not receive make sure you choose fully unlocked not GSM, or any of the carrier and you wont have that issue that many gave a bad review on.i do wish that it did come with the needle extractor for the note pin ""because that is i believe an important feature to have ""another reason i gave it a 4 stars"" now it not coming with any headphones i am ok with because refurbished headphones sounds bad lol.Butall in all i do think its worth the 350-400$ price tag. i mean it is a refurbished phone through amazon after all. If you want refurbished that looks brand new and gets everything go to Samsung web page and pay the extra 120$ if you want, but for most people this is a good price to quality for what you are getting..i would recommend getting this but remember the cons i gave which is the aluminum rails can look worn like mine where the paint is missing ""mine is near the charge port and one of the corners and you do not get the Samsung extraction tool for the pin to remove the tip."" Other then that its a great phone to get in my opinion, those two minus are the reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5.",2020年8月24日 在美国审核

Very happy customer,This phone is awesome! I love it. One tiny scratch on corner can only be seen if looking hard.I have it in a case anyway.

Overall OK,"Phone works fine. Screen had no scratches and arrived with a tempered glass screen protector on (thankfully because I dropped it the first day while waiting on my case and amazingly finally got to witness one doing what its supposed to and only cracked the screen protector and not the phone!) Shipping was almost three whole business days later than tracking was claiming it would be the entire time up until it showed up.Came missing the s pen which was disappointing,didn't get it until a full week later, but it was a brand new Samsung packaged s pen with the accessories which I was pleased with since those are like $60. there were major scratches that chipped all the paint off around the charging port, idk how or why they did that but I was worried whoever used to have this phone was really aggressive with their usage/care and it'd effect the functionality but other than that cosmetic flaw there's nothing wrong with the phone that I've noticed.. all the built in battery health tests pass very well.. says it had 90% of its battery capacity upon first scan. I still feel like for refurbished i paid too much for a used phone that originally was sent to me half missing and seemingly uninterested customer service but it is what it is. Im satisfied overall, I paid just under $300 after tax &amp; it was free to switch it to my active metropcs service in one phone call, also has no boatyard which I've never actually had on a phone before I love that part!If you're considering a refurbished phone at all might as well try it and save a few hundred bucks this way bc Amazon will at least make it better if its not what you were expecting",2021年7月9日 在美国审核

Fake S-Pen,"Got the phone. It works really well, very responsive. I'm happy with my upgrade so far. However, it did not ship with a real S-pen.

"Great Screen, UI is smooth, bad battery life","I love Samsung products, but somehow, they missed the mark on battery life with this phone.

YouTube, texting, Facebook messenger, Pandora are all things I run regularly on this phone. Battery life on the Moto Power, blows all other phones I have ever had out of the water.The phone is complicated. There are soooo many options that I think a user would not need. There are menus upon menus in the setting screens...It's almost like Boot Menu on a Windows PC. Lots of stuff in here most users do not know anything about, myself included.

However this has nothing to do with the seller or the specific device seems it is common on most Samsung's in this model range.I am a very tech savvy person (I work in the cell phone industry). I could not disable the ads with any built in settings and it was doing it before I installed any 3rd party apps. It was super disruptive.

Bixby Fail,"Rating is for the phone itself, not the condition. The condition was ""like new"" and I was very happy with that.I even got the OEM charger included in my box.The biggest problem? The most frustrating thing I have every experienced with a phone? Especially on a phone that costs this much?The Bixby button.The physical button on the side, in the middle. Right where your hand naturally holds the phone so you will CONSTANTLY hit it by mistake.After you hit it by mistake Bixby will take over and what you were doing is gone, poof.So normally if you hit the volume key by mistake (which is less likely since it's higher) then no big deal if your volume goes up or down 2 percent from one wrong tap.Hit the Bixby button by mistake and it opens itself full screen and no matter what you were in the middle of is taken away.Samsung will not let you uninstall Bixby. They won't let you disable it. They only (recently) give you the option of assigning the button to another app, but not an option that just does nothing if you push.And if you double tap (thinking you are changing the volume) it will STILL open Bixby full screen regardless of what you remapped to.Since I can't set it to do nothing - whatever app you remapped to takes over and the screen you were on is gone.I've got to where I don't ever do anything in landscape mode because I know as soon as I rotate the phone in my hand I'm going to touch it by mistake.Bixby is no where near as good as Google or Alexa, can't do all the things G or A can do, but they try to force you to use it. Google or Alexa is not forced on you. You don't want it? Don't install/remove widget/tell it to stop listening for wake up. If your stuff is good people will want to use it, should not be shoved down our throat.Some of my other complaints I think are Android Pie's fault so I won't mention those.The camera software I hate, it's constantly changing the brightness even though the lights in the room I'm in are staying the same. Also if I override the software and brighten it up - the brightness will default itself back to normal if you tap the screen where you want it to focus.So the physical camera may be better than was in my old Note 4, the software makes it aggravating, even the editing software for pictures is worse than my Note 4, but this costs double what my Note 4 did.The speaker on bottom instead of on back or front firing means it gets muffled if you hold in on your chest in bed or place it on a charging stand.The headphone jack on the bottom means I have to hold phone upside down so the jack doesn't get in the way/bent over.Good things? It is fast, responsive, battery life is good (so long as you are not playing a game). Charges fast. Brightness is good.I saw in the news the new Galaxy Fold for $2000 also has a Bixby button. So they haven't learned yet and this will be my last Samsung Phone. I've had only Samsung since the flip phone days.You pay this much for a phone it would be nice if you get to decide how you want to use it and what apps you want to use.",2019年4月18日 在美国审核

I fully understand there may be some quirks ordering refurbed items, and I'm glad they were so quick to take the rma for the DOA os.

It’s ok,"The phone works perfectly fine. However the phone has ALOT of dents and scratches on it, it’s missing the paint on the back of the phone and side in areas. There’s a few deep scratches on the screen",2020年5月23日 在美国审核
"Good for the price point, wish it was less scratched","Have been using it for 2 days and so far I'm happy with it. The box was generic but I got the Samsung fast charger in it, so that's a win based on some other reviews, and the sim card tool. Works for tmobile, no issues. Battery so far is great, no glitches *knocks on wood*. There were some noticeable scratches here and there but nothing major (a case covers them) except the back camera has a big scratch (nevertheless it doesn't seem to interfere with the camera so far.)I'll update if things go south. Came with a 90 day warranty (the box included a warranty paper with the vendors info.)",2019年11月3日 在美国审核
"Electronics are great, hardware is worn","The phone itself functions perfectly. Battery is long lasting and charges well. Arrives in out-of-the-factory settings to set up like new.

Check the Camera,"First phone had a thick scratch on one corner. I didn't want to chance that it was defective and I'd be blamed for a drop, so I sent it back. The replacement phone looked fine, but the camera was defective: fuzzy pictures; could not scan/read receipt/product bar codes, QR codes, or checks for deposit through apps. A couple of days after setup, I tried to use it for a mobile bank deposit - scan in check front and back using camera. Camera took blurry photos. Had to use my S7 Edge, no problem.A few days later I was trying to scan in a bar code through a merchant app that I've used many times. Again, fuzzy view, but this time the scanner didn't work at all. Could not read the bar code. Tried QR Code, no luck. The scanning line kept going up and down not detecting the code.Called Amazon and rep tried but could not fix problem. Amazon transferred me to Samsung support. Samsung rep could not find a solution either and determined the camera was probably broken or there was a settings error. She told me the phone was still under warranty. She didn’t check the IMEI or whatever its called, so I doubted that as this was refurbished, although sold as having a US warranty. But hey, I thought I'd give it a try. She gave me a ticket # to take it to [authorized repair shop] for a free fix or trouble shooting in person. Since I could not exchange it for a replacement with Amazon (only 1 replacement allowed), I decided I’d return it.The next day, I decided to check in with the repair shop to see if I might change my mind, depending on what the tech found since I was still hoping this might be a setting problem and pilot error. Taking that full body case on and off alone was enough to make me briefly consider keeping the darn thing.The [authorized repair shop] rep checked my phone settings and the camera, and determined the camera was broken. They had the replacement part. She checked the phone code with Samsung and said the phone was just out of warranty, but that she could apply for an Extended Warranty and Samsung was pretty good at accepting that. No charge to me. I debated but decided that other things might also be wrong.So, thumbs up to Samsung and the [authorized repair shop]. Thumbs down to seller that tried to pass off a phone with a broken camera. Maybe they didn’t check the camera beyond basic photo taking, but they should have and that alone should have alerted them to a problem.Love the phone, so I bought a new one from Amazon to avoid any ""renewed"" issues and get a real warranty. More than I wanted to pay, but good for a new Note 9. At least I hope it was new!",2020年2月26日 在美国审核

Update:  Open the box phone won't work,Update:I purchased a new charger cable and Box. This allowed the phone to charge. The ones that were included with the phone when purchased were terrible. They were the reason why the phone would not charge and I was getting a water in the phone error message. After spending that amount of money I had to turn around and spend another $20 to buy a good charger and cable. That's the sellers problem. The phone is probably the best phone I've owned to date. It's got a lot of great features the camera is great and it's user friendly. The phone gets 5 stars but I would have to say the seller gets one star got putting junk in the package.Open the package. Very generic and cheap charger. Plugged in the phone and received an immediate error that the phone won't charge. Turned on the phone like the back-end same error phone won't charge.

"Works fine, but piece of junk cable and not what I would call 'like new condition'","The phone itself works just fine. I personally have had no issues getting this phone to work with my service provider as I use T-Mobile as a service provider and the phone itself was previously locked to T-Mobile.I think potential buyers should note, however, that the product description CLEARLY states that the phone will not work on Sprint, Verizon, Boost, Virgin Mobile or any other CDMA network, so a lot of these negative reviews are from people who didn't take the time to read the product specs.The two issues that I had with this phone were that cosmetically it's advertised as being in near perfect condition and mine had a few major gauges on it. It looks like the previous owner did not use a case or screen protector at all, to be honest.The other issue was that while I understood that I would not be receiving any manuals or original packaging, it was supposed to come with a certified cable, which was definitely was not the case. It did include a cable, but the cable was so bad, that even with the phone running with just the absolute most basic of functions, I kept getting an error message basically saying that it was exerting more battery usage than it could renew with the piece of junk cable I had received. Amazon did agree to furnish me with a new cable, but it would have been nice to have a functional cable from the get-go, as I had to make a mad dash to Best Buy just to make sure my phone would be up and running for the next few days.Not a bad value for the price, but if you buy something refurbished, I guess the lesson is to keep cosmetic expectations on the lower end of the spectrum, and expect a few hiccups.",2019年10月5日 在美国审核

Happy so far,"Recieved my Note 9 in the color I ordered. Came with 1 tiny scratch on screen (so small only noticed when cleaning to put on protector) and scratches on one outer corner (not large enough to be concerned with). Being a ""renewed"" phone it isn't surprising that it isn't completely perfect. But the physical flaws are minute. I'm new to android so I might not be the best on a tech review but everything so far seems to be working well, the phone was indeed factory unlocked, and was easy to use through my carrier with proper SIM. The battery doesn't seem to last as long as it says but honestly is probably because I'm still trying to figure out how to turn off extra sounds and notifications. In my opinion (as of now, only 4 days with it), seems to be a good deal for price.Oh and I seen that some mention wanting to know where/company reviewers recieved their phones from... the company on my packing slip reads: Tech Excahngee out of Brooklyn NY (as well as) TECHEXCHANGEE.

"Beat Up, Used, Dirty, &amp; Broken","For close to $500 after tax, you too can buy a completely used and beat up cell phone! These ""renewed"" phones are absolute crap and is actually a scam. I ended up ordering three of these phones and floating $1,500 out just trying to get a phone that wasn't completely jacked up. the first phone that I received was all scratched up on the back glass and after turning it on and spending an hour getting it set up I realized that the edge of the screen had dead pixels on it. The second phone came and the front glass touch screen was completely scratched up so I didn't even bother turning that on. The third phone came and the back glass along with the front glass was completely scratched up as well. this phone was even showing silver on the bottom where the paint had all been scratched off and scraped. Again I didn't even bother turning on that piece of junk. so in the end all three are going back and I won't be ordering another because all they are are used phones that are completely messed up and they aren't even ""renewed"" at all. Usually when electronics are refurbished they use completely fixed cosmetically and any major hardware issues are fixed. These phones are just shipped right from the previous owner by the looks of it. What a waste of time and money. For $486 these phones should be spotless!",2020年6月11日 在美国审核

Inspect The Quality of renewed devices don't buy into the hype of the word renewed,"The phone Works great, battery life is excellent. The one thing I can take way is inspect your device once you receive it, Take it out into direct sunlight and examine it. Don't be fooled by the words renewed nor by reviewers that say my phone was in almost brand new condition, that may not be the case with your unit. Of course I don't expect the device to be flawless but I didn'texpect the condition to be in the words of that famous kiss song(Catch Scratch Fever) On the front and back of the phone. I was going to the return the phone but I lost the Bluetooth SPen, went to Amazon a mistakenly bought the non Bluetooth Spen thinking it was the original so I am not going to defraud anybody by returning this phone without the Actually SPen. I will save up $65 dollars and purchase the pen later, Overall Solid Device if you lose the pen just consider it like a S9 Plus with a boxy shape",2021年5月16日 在美国审核

Disappointed (December to March),"I got this phone beginning of December. The S Pen was not connecting with the device right from the beginning, but I decided to overlook that. Then, during phone calls, one of the speakers was going on and off. It still is. And now (March), top of the cake, when I record videos or just voice messages, there is huge white background noise, even when I am using headphones. Therefore the phone is pretty much useless for the scope. I am highly disappointed, wasted $350, and now I cannot even return it unfortunately, because the return window is gone. The phone had all these issues just within 3.5 months from purchase. I had way higher expectations from Amazon. Sad.",2021年3月12日 在美国审核

Note 9,"The device itself is awesome! I purchased this used (or refurbished?) and the phone I received from this particular company was ok in looks but in the package there was a distinct battery smell. I turned the phone on and everything seemed to work fine, however when I went to plug it up, I couldn't due to the batter port being damaged. (Guess that's why I smelled battery?) So, I informed the sender and they told me to return the phonefor a new one or for a refund. I wanted to give them another chance so I opted to get another phone. The 2nd phone came in 2-4 days later, after I sent the other phone back. So far this phone is doing well, only thing about it is the speaker is not in the best shape. On my calls ppl say that they can't hear me well when on speaker or sometimes it will randomly make it where others can't hear me on the speaker. It's not bad enough to send back but I am not sure how much longer the speaker will last. Overall, fairly decent for the price given the features, age, etc.",2022年1月27日 在美国审核

I will say that I got a bit worried once I started up my phone it said that my sim card( from cricket wireless)was incompatible with the phone( from verizon).

At least for today everything has gone very smooth. The condition of the phone is very nice, minimal scratches, a few notable dents on the body of the phone but nothing that couldn't be covered up with a good case.

"First Amazon Renewed Purchase, will be my last","I bought this phone on August 26, 2020. It's now February 17, 2021, and I have to pay to get it fixed. I paid $416.22 for my phone, now I have to pay another $100+ (depending on what parts need to be replaced) to fix it. I could have bought a new mid-range phone with that money, I didn't, but you can. When I try to charge my phone, a Moisture Detected Error pops up. I've tried almost everything out there that was recommended online to fix it. I've cleaned the charging port, tried a different wall charger and cable, rebooted it, tried charging in safe mode, I've wiped cache partition, almost everything! Except for a factory reset, I refuse to do that, I shouldn't have to do that.When I first received the phone, cosmetically it was fair. It came with that dent/scratch near the pen, it didn't bother me, that's to be expected with a second-hand phone. In retrospect, what I'm about to tell you guys is sketchy and dishonest on their part, but they fooled me, so I guess it's not that big of a deal. Beware of the following. My phone came with a tempered glass screen protector, I thought ""Wow, how nice, they even threw in a screen protector for me!"" Wrong!! Like a month and a half ago, the protector was practically falling off, so I just took it off. And lo and behold, the screen is littered with scratches. You can't tell in the pictures because I already put a new screen protector on it, and like I said, the scratches don't affect the screen quality. But I feel cheated. Performance-wise, then and now, it's great. Some of the reviews on here say, that their phone didn't come fully unlocked, but thankfully, mine did. No problems there.I hope this review helps you make your final decision on whether or not to purchase this phone or any other Renewed device. This is my first time ever purchasing a second-hand electronic device, I always buy new. If you think about it's actually not that bad, $500+ for a flagship device. But, not even 6 months with the phone and I have to pay to get it fixed!! Roll the dice, maybe your experience will be better.",2021年2月17日 在美国审核

Screen Burn-In issues,"My experience was initially good with this product but only after 2-weeks of use I have screen burn in where my navigation buttons are. My use has been very light on and off use which mainly consists of watching YouTube and reading. My screen brightness is always at 30-40% (unless in direct sunlight) with adaptive brightness turned off. I'm very aware of AMOLED screen burn in issues and usually try to mitigate it by having my brightness low and using dark themes to not use the pixels too much. That is why it seems improbable that my use would cause this issue. More than likely the previous owner burned the display out and the refurbisher did a poor job of vetting the phone as in ""like-new"" condition. It's essentially a ticking time bomb of when those pixels are going to die.Overall I'm very disappointed in a product like this and expect better support.I only give 2 stars: 1 for the fact that aside from the screen burn-in, there was no visible damage or scratches on the body, and 1 for the battery that was in decent condition and not completely shot.",2020年3月31日 在美国审核

"RENEWED: Great Price, But battery wont last through a day, replacing battery is difficult.","I purchased this phone because of all the features.One of the features that sold me was the long battery life.This phone can be fully charged in the morning and by noon its at 25 percent.It definitely will not last for an entire day, unless I just dont use it at all.I thought the phone was supposed to have 85 to 90 percent battery life left, mine did not.I might return it because this is not acceptable and to change the battery is a pain because you literally have to heat the phone to soften the adhesive and pry apart the adhesive and try not to damage anything.Don't know if I could do that without breaking it.So i guess I wasted time setting the phone up since i will most likely return it.If you can afford it,get a new phone NOT a renewed phone.Especially since changing the battery is kinda difficultThe actual phone looked like it was brand new without a single scratch on it,and it works fine.It is a great phone.It did not come with any accessories except a generic charger and plug.If you know how to open the phone and change the battery than this would be a great deal.",2020年3月9日 在美国审核

"Seems to work fine, but scratched, packed w/ crappy screen saver hanging off, &amp; generic accessories","Having been heavily involved in the mobile phone repair, refurbishing and reverse logistics business for a few years, a few years back, I expected more from an Amazon certified ""renewed"" product and seller.I received the Note 9 today after a 5 day shipping time (thats with PRIME).First off, the phone is in a bubble bag, inside a generic white box, with NO spacer or even bubble wrap to hold the phone handset from flopping around inside the box that is at least 4 inches longer than the phone and the generic ""Ashley"" charger and cable were all moving around as well.The battery was at 1% when I turned it on, and the phone had to be charged before I could set it up.The back of the handset has significant scratches on the lower edge (see photos), and there was a cheap glass screen saver attached to the front of handset....which I quickly discovered interfered greatly in the touch screen operation on the right side. I removed it immediately and was relieved to find that at least the touch screen was fully functional.I tested all functionality with Samsung's internal 'secret code' test mode and all checked OK, though the S pen seemed to hang up a bit.I will test the handset fully tomorrow with SIM card on a T-Mobile MVNO network.Assuming it all tests well, I will keep the phone, but think at this price at least the 'renewed' (we used to call it refurbished) wouldn't be scratched and original accessories would be included, and that the seller would at least charge the handset before shipping....and think about protecting it in the box for transit.",2019年12月3日 在美国审核

Had no idea Back of phone is also glass,"Its a decent phone I like a lot of features, functions and capabilities of this phone. Ut Nothing's super stellar enough to specifically mention. But overall it all works just fine. A bit slower than i expected and a weak signal at times, seems to be a bit finicky about the charging cord, battery seems to drain quicker than I'm used to. Biometrics are a bit on the slow side to recognize me. Non of those are a a deal breaker for me. The only thing I despise about this phone is how fragile it is! Its got glass on the front and glass on the back, even though I have it in a sturdy leather wallet case with a screen protector I somehow shattered the back glass ???!!! In less than a month of owning it! I've had my IPhone 11 for well over 1 year and not a crack, dent, scratch anywhere on it.

Incredible value,"Totally blown away by the quality of this renewed Note 9. The phone looks like new. It is totally awesome. No scratches on the screen, none on the back or on the edges, it really does look like new. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 (4 1/2 if I could) is the packaging it arrived in. It could easily have been damaged, as the only protection was the padded envelope. But the phone is amazing. To think that this cost over $1000 when new, and believe me, it looks and performs like new, it is a great buy. Once loaded up there was the new updated Android 10 and the new 2.0 UI from Samsung. Without seeming like a parrot. This really is like a new phone. ....... Highly recommended.",2020年5月2日 在美国审核

Not as advertised,"The model I received was a note 9 sm960f which is the Exynos variant. Which means it’s a cheaper version and not as good as the American snapdragon models. In addition the phones screen is more weathered than my s8 that I used until the s21 came out. The frame is also dented and the phone was quite filthy with grime and debris still stuck in the ports. Hardly what I’d call refurbished. In addition the big giveaway is the fact it still has all the telstra bloat ware from Australia. I wouldn’t recommend it unless they discounted it heavily, and even then it’s a stretch.",2021年11月23日 在美国审核

I went back to my S9+ which has crystal clear voice commincation and dictation.

I got a lemon...,"I am a huge fan of the Samsung Note flagship. I really wanted to get the Note 9 because it was the last Note made with a 3.5mm headphone slot; the Amazon renewed was my only option given the budget I set for the phone.Pros:- Even though it is renewed, the phone came with only a little scratch, not more than 1mm in length on the back of the phone, which is acceptable for a renewed phone- Good battery life- Fast fingerprint-unlock recognitionCons:- Many times, the charging slot does not recognize the genuine Samsung USB-C and charger; it either shows it is charging slowly or detects moisture (I know the phone is 100% dry). I had to purchase a wireless charger for that reason. That can become cumbersome when I am on the go and I need to charge my phone- Flashlight in the back is not as bright as my Note 8 that I also own- AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I HATE ABOUT THIS PHONE: the person on the other side of the phone call hears an echo of his/her own voice. I have to use headphones or a Bluetooth headset all the time to have a coherent conversation with anyone",2021年3月31日 在美国审核

This is the second time I boughtthis phone on Amazon and both times they were not the factory unlocked model! My other Samsung Note 9 was unlocked but a Sprint model. For me, it is important to have the factory unlocked model because it does not contain all the bloatware like Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and all the other carriers pre-install on their phones. You cannot delete their bloatware and it wastes a lot of space.",2019年7月3日 在美国审核

My carrier is Verizon and I have never had call quality issues.I know the microphone works well because there are no issues with video or audio recordings.Apparently I'm not the only one who has experienced this voice-quality problem with a Samsung Note 9. I tried the online solutions, but to no avail.Unfortunately, unlike other purchases where I usually get 30 days to ship the item back after I request a refund, in this case I got only one day. I used 89 of the 90 days we get for certified refurbished phone purchases, because I really didn't want to return this otherwise beautiful phone. I wanted to try all the suggested fixes to the problem before giving up. As a result I only got one day to ship the item back afterward. I didn't realize this until it was too late.

Great Phone with a Known Software/Firmware Issue,"Overall, I am happy with my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 .When I initially received my phone, it came in the original box and it was working perfectly.However, after a month my phone began randomly restarting.After doing some investigation, it turns out that there is a known firmware/software issue with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 where the fingerprint scanner gets moisture inside of it and the phone tries to recalibrate the scanner by restarting.Constantly.After some trial and error I got my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 to stop restarting by not allowing the fingerprint scanner to be used to unlock my phone.I can still use my fingerprint to unlock apps, but not even hard restarting allows for me to use my fingerprint scanner to unlock my phone.Everything else on this phone works wonderfully and I would recommend it to anyone, so long as they are happy using iris scanner instead of the fingerprint scanner to unlock their phone.",2020年6月19日 在美国审核

It's a Verizon unlocked phone not factory unlocked. Faulty battery or charger.,"Advertised as a factory unlocked but it was a verizon phone, although it was unlocked and I was able to get my T-mobile sim card to work with phone with not much of a problem. The problem was with the battery- it doesn't seem to hold a charge. After charging to fullovernight, In the middle of the afternoon it will indicate that I only have 15% battery life. That has happened 2 times now, both times strangely enough at 15%. Not sure if it's the generic (cheap) charger, that came with the phone or the phone battery itself. I will test it out with a few more charges and see, or might have to get a better charger, which means I have to spend extra money for :(!<br>I might need to return, but really don't want to because of the inconvenience especially after transferring all my files over to new phone.</br>",2019年10月21日 在美国审核

Everything works on it, sans data (That will be fixed when a new SIM card arrives from my provider) the fingerprint scanner works, the iris/face recognition works wonders. I enjoy this phone, However, the reason this product does not get 5 stars is that I did not receive the crucial part of this phone. The S pen is a very crucial part of the phone and one of the main reasons that I bought it. This product even mentions the S pen inside the description of the product so there is no reason why it shouldn't be with my phone.

I hate this phone. Causes much stress,Don't use facial recognition. Gave battery life five stars.Had a Note 5 and loved it. While I was ill for a year it disappeared.One cannot block calls on this phone unless you memorize the number and go through a couple of stages and then type it in. That makes no sense to me. Why would I want to memorize the numbers of robo calls or any other spam calls. Even worse I cannot hear the phone if it sends a text. On my old phone I could make the ringing of the texts louder than phone calls. I spend hours on the phone with Samsung to no avail. They don't know why Samsung made the newer phone less user friendly. It causes me great stress every day. I truly HATE this phone. There is no improvement from Note 5. Only user friendly options removed.,2022年4月11日 在美国审核

Excellent Phone but with missing box accessories and incorrect charger,"I really like and am enjoying the Note 9. I am very disappointed about not getting the correct accessories in the box when I opened it. First off, the charger I received was not a Fast Charger. I was given a regular 2.0 Amp White Charger. This was the same charger that came with my SG5 back in the day. Lastly, I did not receive the S-Pen extra Tips, S-Pen Ejector Tool, Earbuds or Headphones, Sim Tray Ejector Pin, USB Type C to USB Type A Adapter, and finally the User Guide.This is unacceptable for buying a high end product. I'd like to know if I am going to get compensated for these missing items or get them replaced. How can you sell phones and not include the accessories or the correct charger? The Note 9 has a 4000 Mah Battery. How can you charge this phone without a Fast Charger?I am very unhappy about this purchase.

Recently purchased and Already giving trouble. Phone keeps restarting.,"I purchasedphone about a month ago. Was very hesitant to buy but took a chance. Phone looks new. Justabout 2 areas had fine scratches but apart from that it appeared good.<br>Battery life sucks, even with little use it just dies. Recently started noticing that phone restarts it self. Not sure how long it has been doing it but until recently I started noticing as it happens now about every hour. Tried resetting the phone but nope. Didn't help.I haven't dropped the phone or done any damage to it so I'm assuming its the phone itself.If your thinking about buying this phone to save some money, think twice.

Not quite as described - 1.5 Stars,"My note 9 broke so I looked online for a replacement. Despite those around me saying not to I decided to try a renewed phone. Now I'm not sure how I feel about it after a week of use.Here are the defects I found after a week of use:~The pen doesn't work. As you can see in the photos, the pen doesn't click in all the way and hangs out slightly. This results in the pen not charging and being unusable.~In the description, they say there are no noticeable blemishes from 12 inches, but I can definitely see them from 12 inches. You can see the major blemishes in the photos.~Every now and then maybe 30% of the time the speaker seems to die off. It sounds like the speaker is being covered up and it is hard to hear the person on the other end of the call.~Battery life seems weaker than my previous note 9 which I had for about a year. So, either my previous note 9 retained more than 80% capacity or these ones currently don't have at least 80% capacity as promised.~Data is a bit spotty from time to time. I didn't have these problems with my previous note 9.I'm still debating if I should return it. Just don't expect the ""Product works and looks like new"" promise they have in the description.**EditDecided to return.",2020年2月27日 在美国审核
Do not buy phones from Amazon.,"I would not recommend buying a phone from Amazon. The phone I ordered was supposed to be unlocked and not tethered to any network. It specifically says in the description that it's not.But yet I get the phone and first thing I see is all the verizon logo stuff pop up. It's a Verizon phone. I can text and call but it will not allow me access to my data plan. Will not allow me to update APN setting to fix this either. The seller game me some b.s. excuse saying that the phone is unlocked from any carrier, that the reason it's showing verizon is because of the SIM they put in it to test it put all the Verizon stuff on there automatically. And that all I need to do is pop in my carrier SIM and it will remove the Verizon stuff and replace it with my carrier stuff. That is not how it works.",2021年12月9日 在美国审核

They turned it on for me to make sure everything was okay with the phone. Turns out it was for T-Mobile. Seriously!!! You can’t use t-mobile phones on Verizon and even if it were an option I purchased a Verizon phone. I paid for what I wanted not for what the feel I wanted. Contacted them they pretty much told me oh well. That I could use it. No I can’t. Not even an offer to make it right. Just told oh we’ll send it back.

"Phone is great, but here's the catch.....","Note 9 is operational, in good condition, works as it should. But, here is the catch. They sent me a GSM ATT note 9, instead of the advertised Verizon CDMA note 9. In my situation, it wasn't the BIGGEST deal because I already used a GSM carrier, but was going to go to Verizon. So, the phone still works for me, but, if this were to happen to someone else that had say Verizon and did not want any notion of swapping carrier, this would be problematic for them and they would have to take the time to send it back, get a refund, or send it back to have another sent which raises the risk of it happening again. Best part is when you opened the sim tray, they left in a very beaten old Verizon sim in there like they were trying to insinuate that it was Verizon restored when it was in fact not. Long story short, be careful where you order from.",2020年4月18日 在美国审核

Fully unlocked i think not locked to tmobile,Let me start off by saying the phone is awsome but it is completely false advertising to increase sales. These phone are 100 percent not unlocked as the description claims that they are is a blatant lie then when i ask this seller if they had one that was truly unlocked they tell me to look through there inventory. No thats what you are for breed. You should know your inventory. Although they did send it out and got to me two days earlier tgan expected and the phone was absolutely flawless.

Pro Tip- These Phones are Not Unlocked,This was not compatible with my carrier and tech support could not get it to work. The seller should really sort out which carriers these phones work for and give us options to make sure we are able to order the correct devices. Based on the other reviews it seems like there is a 50/50 chance your phone will work or not. I guess one solution would be to return and rebuy this product over and over until you eventually get one that works. Hopefully Amazon can provide a better solution.,2019年12月6日 在美国审核

"Fragile, poorly balanced, bad notifications","I love this phone. Don't get me wrong. But the screen is so fragile, and easily scratched, and the phone is not balanced right. Regardless of where I put this phone it always falls. And when it falls it hits the screen. My note8 lasted me well over a year and never had this problem. The first week I had this phone the screen just cracked for no reason. Now I dropped it with a case and the corner of the screen shattered. We're talking a four foot drop with a case broke this screen. That's two screens damaged with this phone. My note8 regularly traveled with cheap cases or no case and it had literally no scratches and I NEVER had to replace the screen. I could put my 8 anywhere and it never fell, and if it did, the screen was FINE.My aunt has the same phone. She regularly has no notification sounds or the screen won't light up so she can answer the phone.Between the fragility of the screen, the balance, and the notification issues I'm not impressed with how much it's worth.",2019年10月12日 在美国审核

Read before you buy!,"So I go through straight talk and I was looking for a better phone without having to pay an outrageous amount. Last year I ordered this phone ""UNLOCKED"" only to find out that it was still locked to only Sprint and AT&amp;T. Normally probably wouldn't have been a problem but I live in an area where both of those have no service here. Disappointed, however it was my own fault and should have thought about it before hand. Verizon is the only service here that works amazing in my area so I just ordered the VERIZON edition and can't wait for it to show up around the 9th. That being said. The phone I ordered last year was AMAZING. No dents, scratches. Everything worked better than expected. Phone was in absolute perfect condition and packed very well. I think it even arrived sooner than expected! Even though I made the mistake of ordering the wrong one, I still quite enjoyed using it as a back up for pictures and games that I can't normally download on my measly J7. If you have read into this comment so far, Just be smart about it. Just because a phone says it is unlocked, doesn't necessarily mean it is unlocked to your specific carrier.Pick the service you actually want. If your provider isn't listed then contact the carrier you go through and ask them what works best with their service. That simple. If I would have taken the time to actually ask what would be best and compatible with Straight Talk I wouldn't have made that mistake in the beginning. Anyway, Excited for the new one to get here soon! Can't wait to get rid of my J7! :)",2022年3月3日 在美国审核

I had it plugged into USB 3 cable, only after I realized that it would not charge using cable (did try other known good USB 3.0 cables).

My main issue is I need to take this with me when traveling, and I do not have the available time to return &amp; replace now, so I am stuck with the phone. By time I get back the return period will have ended. Still no idea if phone works well or not, very frustrated this had to happen and certainly a lot of bad timing. However phone was obviously never tested or checked, so I assume I will have to buy a new one soon.",2021年12月13日 在美国审核

"Screen burn, other problems","After a few day's use, I noticed that some icons and status bar (from an older version of the OS lock screen) were burned into the screen. Noticeable on a white background (like when drawing, which is where I first saw it), very noticeable against grey or blue. Color-cycling app didn't ""fix"" it completely. Definitely does not meet the standard of ""unnoticeable at arms length"".I had to pay hundreds of dollars to have a new screen put in. And then even more to have the battery replaced and a new back installed when they discovered the old one had blown out some.The included charger (or the phone itself) doesn't fast charge.The camera (still) has a bad internal glare at night with flash activated (when exposure is high) that I never saw with my S8.It's a Note 9, so it's a good phone, but overall this particular one was pretty messed up, and even after spending a bunch more money on it, it's still not in perfect shape.It was a gift, so I don't know who specifically fulfilled my order, but they should be fired until they improve their QA process.",2021年1月19日 在美国审核
"Im not a verified customer, However Im a real homie.","Heres the facts. The hard facts.I got my Note 9 from Sprint, in a nutshell Sprint is a 2.5 Star of 5. But this aint that.The Note 9 is a beast of a product. Fragile sure but its a power house. I upgraded to this phone from the S7 so maybe I just think its so awesome coming from a 2 yr gap, but Im sure I know my tech and I know what impresses me.Believe me if you want, this aint even my account my grandma has unlimited prime so I just be using this lol. THE NOTE 9 IS A BEAST! Anything you could want in a phone. However I will leave my Pros, and Cons.Pros:- Im going to make this short...... You couldnt be unhappy with this phone. No compromises.- The facial and eye reading stuff makes unlocking a breeze in tight situations where you can particularly touch your finger sensor or draw in your code. Just facial is faster but face and eyes are best security.Cons:- I feel the curved edges make screen protection difficult. Ive went though 3 tempered glass protectors, all cheaper ones. Havent tried whitestone yet because of price, however I have tried Ni-Shen liquid adhesion, Wehasi 2 pack, and also WTOSE's protectors, none of which worked well sent all of them back.- Cases made for this phone, because of the curved edges, make it difficult to find the right case, I sent 1 back and got an otterbox symmetry series case, which also does not fully protect the screen in a drop because the lifted beveled edges do not protect the screen when dropped on a jagged edge.Overview:Its the best phone Ive had. Im not really rough on my phones so I dont mind the edges and I pay insurance through a carrier, so its not a major deal to me.Buying this unlocked you take on the full responsibility of repairs so I cannot speak on the seller, nor their product. This is simply a review on the phone itself.",2019年3月26日 在美国审核
Do Not Buy,Bought this as a replacement for my Note 5 which I enjoyed until it abruptly failed to turn on one day. Tried replacing the battery to no avail so I replaced it with the Note 9. I loved this phone until after owning it for 1 year and 2 weeks. While using my phone today the screen abruptly dimmed/faded and took on a green hue. It is functional but it’s terribly ugly and puts a strain on the eyes. I will NEVER buy another Samsung phone again,2020年6月21日 在美国审核

I'm very happy with it.Works perfectly.However, I know that occasionally refurbished phones work great until they don't.Sometimes they start out fine and after a few months, you run into an unknown or unforseen glitch.

"So far, so good","I got this product for my fiancee, since he needed an upgrade from his Note 4.He was going to a get refurbished one from ebay, but when I read the reviews for the refurbished phones here, I figured if it is almost as good as new, then why not? It has been under 2 weeks since he had it and he just activated it last weekend, but he likes it so far.Longer battery life, the GPS tracker is not as slow, and he has more camera features.He did mention about the phone using more energy when he is using it to take pictures and video (the phone gets warm to hot), since the processing of pictures uses more energy (?) Is this common for Note phones (or the Note 9)?I would not know since I am an iphone user.The Note 9 also uses a different charger from his Note 4, so he had to buy the additional accessories.But so far, so good.",2019年2月26日 在美国审核

Samsung Certified Renewed Does Not Equal Good Quality Control,"I was gifted a renewed Note 9 to replace my current Note 9, because AT&amp;T's 3G sunsetting arbitrarily means they cannot support any phones that aren't specifically US versions.

Samsung renewed is the way to go!,"I have a Note10+ that I bought new almost two years ago and I love. I mean my phone has it all. My husband's old dumb phone is now obsolete so I wanted to get him something as awesome as my Note10+, but money is tighter now than it was two years ago. The Samsung renewed Note9 looks brand spanking new! It came in a new sexy Samsung box with all new doodads. It has the same warranty as new. This phone sells for double the price as new on Samsung. So half price for a phone you can't tell is renewed is a no brainer. From now on if I ever need to upgrade, I will do Samsung renewed. But I sure hope that doesn't happen for many many years.The phone itself is pretty darn close to as wonderful as my Note10+. I can tell the difference in the camera, but I'm a photographer.It works the same and has an artillery of functions built in. It's fine for my husband. The phone is slightly smaller than the Note10+, but barely a difference. I think this screen is possibly safer from breaking than the Note10+, as it doesn't go all the way to the edge.I don't like the Bixby button on the left side, as I have a power button there on my phone, so as I was setting up the Note9 for my husband, I've repeatedly pressed it, bringing up Bixby. But I imagine it will be no problem for my husband as he does not have that habit.The finger print scanner being next to the camera seems like a bad idea. My husband keeps touching the camera to use it, but hopefully he'll get better at it. On a Note10+ the finger print scanner just shows up on the screen when you need it and then disappears. Much better.The pen is great! You will love using it. It is not a dumb pen like in other types of phones, but a bluetooth that can do stuff to blow your mind. There's this dude I will mention further in this review, he can help you learn all about that. I recommend an app called Sketchbook for drawing and art stuff. While the Notes app is good, this one has a ton more features and art supplies. I just discovered it today, thanks to my daughter's recommendation and it's a pretty big difference. It's free and apparently beloved by many artists.The phone updated to Android 10 and One UI 2.5, in case anyone wants to know. I think that may be as high as they go.Pretty much everything else works the same as the Note10+.I think we got a great deal and I'm happy my poor husband finally has a smart phone.Something I recommend to everyone I know: We do BYOP on Tracfone. We do not select their low monthly payments, just the occasional adding on of data and minutes. It's so cheap there and they use AT&amp;T towers. Same great coverage and we don't have ridiculous monthly payments. Since this is his first smart phone I had to buy a year card with them (normally $120) and I found a $50 off coupon for that at TracfoneReviewer online. There's always coupon codes for tracfone there. With my Note10+ I spend no more than $160 a year for minutes, data, text, and time. That's it. It's always been enough. I highly recommend Tracfone. Don't sign up for a monthly plan with them. It's not necessary. And you can always do that if you find you need it. Also their prices are upfront. No added fees. Ever. Just saying. You're already thrifty looking at a renewed phone, go all the way! Save money. We've been using Tracfone for 17 years at least. If you think you are interested in doing that, make sure to order the Tracfone Sim Card kit with this phone. It is usually anywhere from $1 if it's sold by Amazon, or $5 from a private seller. Free if you ask Tracfone, but be prepared to wait forever for it to arrive. Depending on where you live you could end up using Verizon, AT&amp;T, or TMobile towers. The Tracfone website let's you know which SIM card you will need.Now, this next piece of advice is gold. There's this awesome tech guru on youtube called sakitech. He has 1.5 million subscribers for a reason. Look for ""250+ Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Tips, Tricks and Hidden Features"" by Sakitech and set some times aside. Go at your own pace. You too will be a Sammy guru when you're done. You will know how to do all kinds of stuff on your Samsung Note9 (or 10+ if you go that route, he has a video for that too). I'm so glad I saw his Note10+ video. It helped me to get more out of my phone from day one. And he is easy to understand.Oh yeah I noticed the bad reviews in this listing. That was for other sellers. As long as it says SHIPS AND SOLD BY AMAZON, and it is SAMSUNG CERTIFIED RENEWED, you are golden. If not, as you can see from the bad reviews, well you're playing the Amazon seller lottery.Okay, I've done what I can here. I like helping people and I hope my tidbits have helped you.

I got what I ordered (an unlocked used note 9),"Ok I get it. Some people say they didn't get what they ordered. I did. I got a note 9 in excellent condition and unlocked. It works with metro PCS (T-Mobile towers) and had no issues getting put on my plan. I'm not saying other people didn't have issues but I will be ordering a second one for someone else on my plan. I don't know why some orders are better than others and if I get a bad phone on my second order I will update this one as well as saying so on the review for that one, but as for now I got what I wanted and I'm not sure the ""scam"" is on the sellers side. Just remember people want stuff for free; so if they think a bad review will get them something for nothing they will put heart and soul into it. Our society is sad and there's definitely alot of ""I deserve"". Just tell people you got what you got. Don't talk crap about something if it's not true. If you wrote a bad review for something and it didn't deserve it then you should be ashamed; then again if you were able to then of course you won't feel bad about doing so. You think every company can afford every sing person getting free stuff. It's sad... Just so sad. People like that don't understand saying ""they can afford it"" means bankruptcy. Imagine how many people say it every day. You think you are the only one trying to scam a company? You are not even close to the first person to think of that ""scam"". You are just another freeloader trying to get something you don't deserve. Stop ruining small business trying to make your life better. You will still be bitter and angry that no one likes you. Just because you have a new phone doesn't make you cooler or more important and telling people you got it for free because you cried about something makes people like you less. Pay for what you get and get what you pay for. If you don't like it then send it back. Stop expecting to get an amazing deal because everyone is thinking just like you; make money and don't get taken advantage of.",2021年12月3日 在美国审核

It came in great condition with a Samsung fast charging cable and box and the sim card removing tool. I put my cricket wireless sim card in and it was good to go. I'm very happy with my purchase so far and its pretty awesome they give you 90 days to return it if need be.

If you are hesitating, keep in mind that most providers have a ""Bring Your Own Device"" option, so check with your provider.The seller was very helpful, and offered support for any problem that may arise. Having an unlockeddevice is essential, but sometimes the model number could be an issue with your phone service provider. No worries though, because that can be resolved by ""flashing"" the device.

"A great, heavily customizable phone","I bought this to replace a Pixel 3a XL. So far it has been a great replacement, with comparable battery life and several great features (although it can feel a bit bloated at times). The best part is I was able to use the same third party launcher (Nova) rather than the default to keep my home screen clean and apps well organized. The pen is fun to use although it takes some getting used to, especially for drawing. One thing I can do without is the Bixby button, but you can change it so that the button can open apps or functions so that's neat. Overall this is a great phone that I'll hopefully be using for a long time.",2021年12月10日 在美国审核
Very dissatisfied. Not worth it.,"I received the phone and it looked decent for a used phone. The ""sim removal tool"" was a paperclip. It worked but they should just say a paperclip because I almost threw it away because it's not what the description said. The phone worked great for about a week then it started resetting and powering down on it's own at random times then almost constantly. Also the battery dies very quickly. After a day or so of trying to figure out what was wrong with no solution, it started working normally again. Then a few days later it starts messing up doing the same thing again. This time I contacted the seller and they ran me through the normal things that I found on google that I already tried. And when all else failed they wanted me to send it back. I couldn't send it back right away because I don't have that option at work so they offered a partial refund. I assumed on a $270 purchase it would be at least 50% but they offered $25. And after I told them that it was an insult to receive such a low refund for a malfunctioning phone that I had for a week, they stopped responding altogether.",2021年7月15日 在美国审核

Great phone,"So far the phone is pretty good I've had the phone since January 24th and it's now march 26, It's been pretty good it serves its usage for what a phone should do. The battery life is great I normally don't need to recharge it everyday usually its 2 or 3 days. The response of the phone is perfect, Apps install super fast compared to my old phone and tablet.My only con to this phone is I would have to go to a store to get the battery replaced if the battery ever goes bad but great phone nonetheless.",2022年3月27日 在美国审核

Quality and fast &amp; capable customer support.,"I was very concerned about buying renewed for $400 items, especially a cell.But Hybrid IT was right on top of customer care.The main thing is the phone works well &amp; not looking damaged.The accessories were secondary.However, this one came with the phone and charger (not oem).The charging cable was a slow one and I mentioned it to the seller. In less than a day, a customer rep called me to handle it. She said they would a refund me,( a very fair $) to get a cable here. I found a fast cable at a dollar store, plugged into their adapter, and all is well.I would buy from Hybrid IT again.I did not test all of the ph capabilities yet, but it covered all my concerns so far.It doesn't matter that it was a sprint unlocked. I put in my nano sim from T-mobile and it moved seamlessly.Same with the smart switch from my pre-owned Amazon Note 5, all moved over fine.If all renewed and refurbished worked this way, there is no reason not to buy.",2020年8月31日 在美国审核

At first after connecting it to wifi it will start doing all the updates and it might take a whole entire day till it gets the latest version. I also bought a cover so it will protect it.

Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Review,"I had the Note 8 and wanted to upgrade, and upgrade I did. Had a few issues with this phone at first, but most turned out to be Tmobiles fault, the rest were due to apps I installed. All in all I would say buy this phone if you wanta powerful smartphone that is both functional and looks good, even more so than the newer note 10, not so much the 10 plus though. If you have the money and absolutely have to have the best that's out there buy the Note 10 plus, otherwise this is the better value. Very pleased with this purchase.

So relieved,I have always bought my Samsung Notes new but when my Note 8's is camera broke it was time to look into an upgrade. The days of me paying a $1000 for a phone were long gone in my head so a new Note 10 or 20 were out of the question.The Note 9 however has always appealed to me as the last great Note series with even better battery life than the newer Notes.It was selling at a good price for a renewed version on Amazon so I took a leap of faith and bought one.I say a leap of faith because one I had never bought used and two I had heard horror stories and read horrible reviews about people who had such bad experiences buying renewed phone.I was a bit skeptical to say the least but I bought the Note 9 anyway and I can honestly say I could not be happier with its condition and how quickly it was delivered. I would not be able to tell that the phone had ever been used before because it came in perfect and pristine condition.I even received an actual Samsung charger with it which many people in their reviews complained the seller would send some cheap knock off charger instead.Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones and only time will tell if the battery lasts and everything keeps working as great as it is now but for now I am thrilled with my decision to buy the phone.,2020年10月17日 在美国审核

Phone locked to Sprint,"I ordered this phone as a replacement for my Note 8 after the screen went bad, and upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised that it looked brand new. It arrived 2 days ahead of the projected shipping date, but I was unable to activate it. Upon further investigation, I discovered that it was locked to Sprint. I contacted Sprint to attempt to unlock it, and they stated that they couldn't unlock it without specific information about the previous account that it was linked to, which I would have to obtain from the seller.I then contacted Amazon customer care, and they stated that as Prime Mobility is a third party seller, all they could do on my behalf was email the seller and submit a request for them to contact me. The seller contacted me in less than 24 hours and informed me that they were unable to unlock the phone for me or provide the information necessary for me to have Sprint unlock the phone, and that I would have to submit a return request, leaving me to have to shop around for another phone and wait additional days with no functioning phone or spend money out of pocket on a cheap phone from walmart while I wait for a new phone that meets my needs to arrive.I am very frustrated, and for the price, I expected the product that I ordered to be as advertised-fully unlocked to all carriers.

"Similar to new, with one small defect","I purchased my product from Hybrid IT. Looking up my IMEI number, my device was originally purchased about a year and a half before I bought it (in March 2019). My model number is SM-N960U1, which means I got the US Snapdragon version that was originally factory unlocked (despite me purchasing an AT&amp;T locked phone). The original owner apparently used Sprint on it, but after uninstalling the Sprint software it worked just like a normal factory unlocked processor.For anyone looking to purchase a Galaxy Note 9 two years after its launch, know you're getting a great phone hardware-wise but which will probably stop receiving software updates soon. I plan on using the Microsoft Launcher after OneUI Home started taking 10% of my battery life, and switching to LineageOS once security updates stop later this year.Pros + It came in rather good condition, albeit with a couple small scuff marks along the side and some dust in the speaker grill. + Almost all the features I've tried so far seem to work without issue (WiFi, Bluetooth, most S Pen funtionality, Dolby Atmos, DeX, wireless charging, heatbeat sensor, iris scanning) + My battery health was 93%, well in excess of Amazon's minimum of 80% That means my battery capacity is 3700 mAh instead of the original 4000 mAh, which is enough for my phone to last a good 6-7 hours with the screen on right now.Cons - It came in a nondescript box (no markings, definitely not original), with no particular packaging material aside from a bubble wrap sleeve. I also received no original documentation and none of the replacement S Pen tips/tip remover that normally comes with the Galaxy Note 9. The tip provided seems to have been one of the softer ones - softer than my preference, but OK. - The S Pen's EMR technology works properly, but it's wireless connectivity seems to be shot. Either the internal supercapacitor is dead and can't hold a charge, or the wireless communication circuitry is broken. It's also possible that this is a cheap clone S-pen without wireless capabilities. - It wasn't updated to the latest OneUI version before factory reset, which required an hour-long download before I could reliably use it---Minor pluses that aren't really device-specific - Using bxActions to remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant worked!Minor issues that might not be device-specific (none of my friends have a Note 9 for me to compare to) - None of the GCam ports I've tried work on this phone - The mechanical shutter is quite loud for some reason - The face unlock/iris scanning reliability is a little iffy - Fingerprint recognition takes a while to register when using LastPass",2020年8月23日 在美国审核

This phone stole my heart. Goodbye Pixel 4!,"I'm obsessed with this phone. It's definitely big, and took a small adjustment period to get used to holding my phone with two hands lol. It's super light weight. Battery life is pretty solid, and it has so many battery saving options to extend it even further. The screen is super adjustable, from the lighting/dim/dark mode, all the way to this thing called ""edge"", which is the edges all around the screen. I'm obsessed with the edge color flash! I love that I can do 5x6 icons and fit more of my apps on one slide. I have straight talk and after a little bit of customer support, I got my phone fully working with a new sim. It comes with a fast charger, and it takes a C charger, which is awesome cause I had a pixel 4 before and it took Usb C as well! I'm so grateful to finally have a fingerprint reader back too! The space on it is a lifesaver. The stylus and drawing apps are awesome. They even have a tattoo ink style of writing that, again, I'm OBSESSED with. You can take pictures and stuff with the stylus as well. This is probably thee most customizable awesome phone I've ever held in my hand. And I've been all the way from iphone to Android to Google pixels. So far I definitely prefer this phone to the pixel 4. I had the pixel 3 before and loved it the most until this one.

So far a great transaction and product - Note9,"Any concerns I had about buying used were lifted by this transaction and the virtually new Note 9.. Have used it for over a week and tested everything. Transferred my sim from my old Note2 and worked immediately after rebooting.Having used Samsung Note phone for over 7 years, I was pleasantly surprised by its speed and overall generally better layout of everything.And the screen and brightness are a vast improvement over the old Note2. Battery life is also quite amazing.This unit comes in a plain box with a charger and usb to usb c cable.The seller was IBuzz and was fulfilled by Amazon.",2020年11月18日 在加拿大审核
"Calidad a buen precio, pero accesorios deficientes","Ahora mismo lo estoy probando llevo 4 días con el y hasta el momento todo va perfecto, con la excepción de que llega en un empaque muy muy diferente al original, pero yo creo que eso es lo de menos ya que al tener un celular de esta calidad por ese precio vaya, no hay problema alguno, lo malo es que el cargador con el que lo recibí se calienta horrible y no carga el celular se tarda horas. Tuve que conseguir otro por que la calidad del cargador deja mucho que desear, seguiré utilizándolo esperando que todo siga perfecto.",2021年3月10日 在墨西哥审核
Excelente Amazon,"Es la segunda vez que compro un producto Renewed y afortunadamente me han salido muy bien, en este caso era importante ya que no era para mí…Sólo hay dos detalles a considerar.1. El distribuidor DHL abrió el paquete, se nota como fue cortado e incluso mayugado para meterlo y sacarlo del empaque que Amazon envía. MUY MAL. Yo me espanté terriblemente porque bien podían cambiar el paquete por otra cosa y se haría irrasteable el mismo. Ni si quiera tuve que abrir la caja esta vez con un cutter o tijeras, sólo meter mi mano que cabía perfectamente…2. El celular venía descargado en su totalidad, lo que significa un peligro ya que al ser importado y puede ser un viaje largo, la batería al llegar al 0% definitivo puede morir y llegar al destinatario sin poder utilizarae.Afotunadamente ninguno de los inconvenientes pasó a una tragedia…Recomendaría que si Amazon contrata a otro distribuidor externo, como lo fue DHL; el destinatario les tomara sus datos e incluso una foto de cómo recibe y por quién recibe, por si hay algún inconveniente como a mí me pasó.Los puntos realmente buenos que tuve con el proveedor fueron que éste me dio cargador, cable y adaptador originales. También me dieron la plumita para sacar la sim o la memoria. Lo cual me sorprendió mucho ya que al comprar estos productos te dan accesorios genéricos.Sin duda alguna recomendados.",2021年11月8日 在墨西哥审核

Stop researching phones and get the Note 9!,3 days in and I can already tell this is the best phone I have ever had. Phone arrived very fast and in mint condition. If someone used this phone they must have been very careful with it because I would have assumed this phone is new. It has small but important features like the LED notification light and the headphone jack that the Note 10 does not have. And of course wireless charging is built in and is a huge game changer. Even though its almost 2 years old this is the best phone you can buy in my opinion.,2020年7月4日 在加拿大审核
Awesome phone,"Got this phone to replace my Huawei p20 pro. Was used to front mounted fingerprint sensor but am finding the rear mounted one on this phone is more comfortable to use.The camera has a ""single shot"" feature that automatically pics out the best pics and small clip videos over a set time which I thought was pretty cool.Am loving the stylus function as I can edit things quickly on the go, or let my daughter play with the coloring book when she's bored.Phone is very responsive, with a very good battery life, and beautiful display.Absolutely a worthwhile phone and I highly recommend ",2021年10月10日 在加拿大审核

"Like new condition, fast delivery, works in Canada, excellent customer service","We have just received the phone in perfect condition. Ordered a new cheap Lucky mobile SIM for my mother in law who arrived in Canada to help with kids, It works well in Canada. She is happy. Thank you Toronto Cellular very much!In our situation ordering new expensive phones makes no sense as we have small children, and few new phones have broken displays. Fixing is expensive, so, the option to purchase refurbished from Toronto Cellular instead of repairing was an excellent idea. We have purchased 5 phones from Toronto Cellular within 3 months already and only one needed warranty replacement. Exchange was easy, fast and efficient due to excellent customer service. Hope there will be no need to change any one again. And we know where to order in case kids break the phone again.Thank you Toronto Cellular for your excellent service.",2021年12月9日 在加拿大审核

Not for Canada,"I am very disappointed with this product. The phone itself is amazing, and came in great condition, but stating that it is fully unlocked is an outright lie. The phone I received is a Verizon model,with the CSC locked to verizon. This means I cannot get software updates unless I have a Verizon sim card. Also, since this is the US snapdragon version, I cannot unlock the OEM to do any firmware updates myself.Nov-19 security is not ok with me, nor should it be ok with anyone else. This phone should not be sold in the Canadian marketplace if it cant be used properly in Canada.

Phone itself is like new,"Arrived a day early. Overall good condition, there was only a single scratch on the back which isn't too noticeable. Battery seems to be new. It didn't come with the original box and the unofficial charger was in very bad condition and speed was only 0.7 amps (very slow) however that was expected since the listing said so. Came with the original S Pen which is also in like new condition, didn't notice a single scratch on that. Got it for my Canadian Public Mobile Sim and all the features work perfectly. (Some reviews said that they couldn't send images via text/MMS, but I never had that issue.) The phone I got was truly unlocked and didn't have any carrier-related bloatware. Also for those wondering it does not come with a screen protector. Overall satisfied!Edit: forgot to update this review in a while. Started noticing problems with the original phone on the second day, the signal was very poor no matter where I was and it had a hard time receiving/sending messages and calls, seems like the antenna was defective. Sent back and ordered the same one again, this time it was a good working one. Also it arrived with the stock Samsung charger, cable, sim tool, screen protector and a 1 month koodo trial sim. Only things I've noticed is that the fingerprint ready came very scratched but it still works very quickly. Currently using the phone for several months and still no issues.",2021年3月15日 在加拿大审核

Beware buying from this company,"So this is my second time buying a Note9 from this ""certified refurbished"" company on Amazon.The first phone was in great shape, and worked well (for three weeks). One day it just shut down, and never turned on again. I took it to a Samsung authorized repair center, and they said there was water damage (not recent) and that the motherboard was covered in rust.I've never had this phone come close to getting wet by any means, so obviously it was water damaged prior to me taking delivery.I ended up sending that one back, and getting another one. The second one looks like it was beat on pretty bad by the last owner.

A bit disappointed,"Bought the ""Canadian Version"" of the refurbished Note 9, but I'm not sure it's actually the Canadian version and there are a few issues. Most annoyingly it's got ""OMADM"" installed (system app that can't be removed) and as far as I can see that would be for Sprint (American carrier). Every time you restart the device it's going to unsuccessfully try to register the device through OMADM and you'll be left with a notification you can't delete unless you go through a fairly involved process to force stop the application (which you will need to repeat every single time you restart the device). Secondly, about 60% of incoming calls don't connect (the caller hears a few beeps, call drops, does not forward to VM). I don't get a ton of calls so not a huge deal but certainly disappointed.",2021年9月22日 在加拿大审核
