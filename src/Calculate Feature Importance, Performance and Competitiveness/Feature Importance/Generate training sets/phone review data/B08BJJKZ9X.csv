Phone looks brand knew.,"I bought this phone for my son that lives in Jamaica as a Christmas gift.You see I was so nervous and skeptical to buy this phone. because of the mixed reviews.the phone came with a charger, the pin to pull out the SIM card draw, a receipt and a instruction card if you’re gonna send it back. The phone and everything mentioned was packed in a nice box.The phone is clean and looks brand new. no scratches or scrapes. it’s also unlocked which is what i payEd for. Everything on the phone seems to be working fine for now, I’ll update later if anything changes. So far I’m happy with my purchase. no complaints",2019年12月7日 在美国审核
Best smartphone made (not kidding),"I’ve owned my iPhone XS Max for a little over a month now. Let me say this, I started with the original iPhone and kept them through the 4S. I made the switch to Galaxy, and had those through the S6 Edge. Made the switch back and I can tell you my user experience is better than any phone ever. I was definitely the one that argued Galaxy are superior. For many reasons they are. I’ve played with the X, and was disappointed.Pros:Battery life is superior to anything I’ve ownedReception hands down is the BEST. I can use it without issue in the big department stores that plague everyone.The feel of this phone is luxury at minimum. It’s flawless in your hands.It’s faster than any galaxy or iPhone I’ve ever used and tried (Note 8 and S9)The apps are just designed better.I am a very heavy user and stream EVERYTHING. I have never had an issue with reception, speed or lagging, ever.3D Touch and face recognition are super fast and user friendly. I’ve noticed face recognition gets better with use. It’s constantly calibrating, which means as you change, so it does.The camera, hands down is such an incredible quality. Both features and image quality.You know this about iPhone, and ignore marketing of other companies, it’s BS.Wireless charging is lightning fastSeamlessly connects with iPad and they automatically update each other with apps etc. THIS is super cool!!!The speakers are incredible! I actually have to turn it down a couple notches as it’s very loudThe new Gold is just absolutely stunning. The backing is a pearlized gold and the trim around it is a classy and metal gold. StunningCons:PriceyNo headphone jackAll glass (doesn’t bother me as I am extremely careful with my phones) but the average person that drops, you need to put a case on.No headphones includedNo cable included (I bought a 5 pack from Amazon anyway beforehand, so it’s a non issue)The notch. Bit of an odd eyesore but in turn I get HD quality calls and reverse camera functionality)Overall this truly is an incredible device.",2018年12月9日 在美国审核

Beautiful phone with amazing performance.,"6 Months Later update - Still acts like I bought it yesterday. Everything is so smooth, fast, responsive, battery health is still great, and there have been no issues I know of whatsoever. Still have no regrets with this purchase and love this phone! (Original review is below.)<br>First off, I would like to provide my experience with purchasing a used phone. I was very hesitant with this one. But Amazon has a wonderful return policy so I thought, if it isn't what I'm expecting, I can always return it.The things I was very concerned about with previous reviews is if the phone had been wiped correctly to be set up as a new iPhone, if the phone had been previously stolen, if the phone is truly 'unlocked', if the storage space was as I ordered, or if the phone was even a genuine Apple product in the first place!Upon opening it, I did find some light scratching on the front and back glass. Of course, this is to be expected. I'm very happy that there's nothing major at all. The stainless steel band is SPOTLESS.I powered it on, it greeted me with Apple's famous multilingual 'Hello' screen. And THANKFULLY the phone was indeed wiped properly before handed down. I set it up with my Apple ID and went straight to settings. I checked the Serial Number at Apple's website. And was so happy that what I received was a 100% genuine XS Max. I was also very happy to discover that the storage was what I ordered and that yes, the phone is unlocked. I also checked the battery health which is at 98%. Leading me to believe this phone had only been used lightly before.Everything checks out, I am thrilled! Coming from an iPhone 8 Plus, I notice that the phone feels equally as good in my hand. But the smoothness of the stainless steel just adds such a premium feel to it. And have I mentioned the gold is absolutely stunning!? I'm really happy I chose the XS Max over the 11 Pro Max. Mainly because of the rather strange looking new camera design.Being a huge fan of Touch ID, I was very upset about having to switch to Face ID. But honestly, it's actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Its quicker, more secure, and more convenient that your phone just knows that it's you.Now, Performance. This phone excels at pretty much all that I ask it to. Games are faster and smoother than I've ever experienced on a mobile device. (Even the Note 9 I had.) And the new OLED Super Retina Display makes movies, videos, and pictures just incredible. The blacks are SO dark, they blend in perfectly with the outer screen. The camera is unbelievable too. Photos are sharp with detail and the colors are impressive.So overall, my experience of purchasing a used phone couldn't have gone smoother. I am very happy with it! Just make sure you buy from a seller with a bunch of great reviews and you'll most likely get a truthful and legit product like I did.</br>",2019年12月20日 在美国审核
Review,"INTROI bought the iPhone XS Max on the first day it came out on September 12, 2018. I purchased the 64gb gold model. I have owned other iPhones in the past such as the 6 and 8 plus and many other Apple products. I’ve also had Androids and many different types of PC’s. In this review I will focus on mainly the camera and battery.IDEAL USERThe ideal user for the iPhone XS Max would be someone who has owned an iPhone before. The reason I say this is because it has so many similarities to its previous models such as the format of the apps. Also, the shortcuts on this new iPhone are extremely similar to the old generations.CAMERAIn my opinion, the iPhone XS Max camera is one of the best and offers amazing advantages. There is this new feature where you can now change the depth of field of a picture that has already been taken. Another plus is that you can do this to photos that have taken by both the front and back camera unlike androids. Some androids can also adjust the depth of field but only before the picture is taken and not after. I use this feature all the time and improves the picture dramatically, making them look professionally taken.BATTERY LIFEThe battery life for the iPhone XS Max is the biggest battery that has ever been on a iPhone. It can even last an hour a half longer than its previous model the X. I start off my day with a fully charged phone every day and stream music, watch videos, roam social media for hours and it does not die. It is at a low percentage, but it still has battery. So basically, one full charge can last you the whole day maybe even two.OVERALLOverall, this phone is good phone for anyone who wants to upgrade from their older generation model. The camera will never fail you, it’s the best on the market and offers many editing abilities with the camera. The battery is so big on the XS Max that you won’t always need to carry your charger with you. These are the only things I could talk about in a short review because this phone has so many advantages.",2019年2月15日 在美国审核

So far so great!,"I was initially skeptical about buying a used phone, but the experience so far has been great. I've been playing with the phone for the past few days and held off before writing a review to test things out. There weren't any major scratches/dents on the device, with an exception to some small scratches on the stainless steel bezel. Those were probably inevitable anyways, and can easily be polished out with a Cape Cod cloth. The screen didn't have any scratches visible to the naked eye, and was in very good condition. One thing I have noticed is that when turned off the device takes sometimes up to 20 seconds or more before powering on, which I don't know if is common for iPhones as this is my first one. Another thing I thought I would be worried about is the battery health, which hasn't been a problem. In fact, the model I got was at 100%! This makes me believe it was either recently changed or Apple has some serious durability on their battery, as I've gone over a whole day without charging when starting at 100%. Everything feels fast, and works as it should. I also had some time left the original apple 1 year warranty, so should be covered for the next few months.<br>Overall, I can't speak for other sellers, but SikkSound gave me a very good phone! However, I would recommend buying from a reputable seller on Amazon if you're going the used route, and to be able to make sure you can return if there are any problems, since it can honestly be a crapshoot from what I've read in other reviews.I will update my rating if anything changes or goes wrong with the phone.EDIT: After using the phone for just a few months, there is now a speaker problem with the speaker. It has a very noticeable distortion when playing audio. I haven't exposed it to water or dropped it at all. I'm considering doing a return.</br>",2019年7月25日 在美国审核

Amazing and in Mint Condition!!,"Amazing deal!! The phone is in mint condition and everything works and looks like new. I purchased the fully unlocked (all carriers) renewed premium phone sold by Amazon. Renewed premium phones come with a year replacement or return on them plus a guarantee of at least 90% battery life. The regular renewed phones only have a 90 day return or replacement window and at least 80% battery life. My battery shows 93% which is excellent for a used phone. The phone is super fast when surfing the web or playing games and the camera is incredible. I love the facial recognition feature and the speakers sound amazing compared to my old iPhone. It was packaged with care in a nice box which also included pamphlets, a sim card key and a charger with cable. I am so happy I purchased this and highly recommend purchasing renewed premium.",2021年4月6日 在美国审核
"Buying ""Renewed by Amazon"" experience - The iPhone XS Max","So, I recently made the decision to move back to Apple from Android and was not going to spend the $1000 on a ""renewed"" device when functionality wise, the XS max and 11 Pro max are very close.With that, I chose to go down the Amazon renewed route rather than taking a chance on ebay simply due to the ability to very easily return the device if it does not live up to Amazon's renewed standards, never mind having a 90 day return window if something does not go as expected (remember, this is ""renewed"", not NEW so by this time, most bugs or hardware issues should be worked out and if not, you will know pretty quickly and be able to return/replace).<br>So there are two things I would recommend when buying a ""renewed"" device.First, just don't buy right off the main device page, but research the vendors that Amazon uses as all of them are not equal in quality or customer satisfaction.I learned this the hard way.Second, I will say that MOST of the devices you will receive, cosmetically will ""look"" brand new, which in my book passes the first test.I did have a device that looked good, but had internal hardware issues and I had to send to send it back. twice.(This goes back to the vendor research and their ratings).In all, the phone I received from CTS warehouse was nearly perfect both cosmetically and function wise AND I got a brand new third party charger &amp; cable (You really don't NEED Apple branded), which also works perfectly.So, before you press the buy button, do your homework on who the vendor is otherwise, Amazon's ""Renewed"" program is probably the best one out there for saving hundreds on a device that looks and functions like new rather than taking a chance on ebay.</br>",2020年10月18日 在美国审核
Satisfied!,"Ordered: Unlocked iPhone Xs Max Silver-(256GB)<br>I’ve seen a few one star reviews, so here’s a full honest review.The phone arrived sooner than expected. The packaging was light, but also secured. After un-wrapping the phone. I’ve noticed it had no front/back glass scratches or cracks. However, it did have hardly noticeable chips on the metal sides. The phone was also a little dirty around the edges and camera. (Which was easy to remove and back clean!) As promised the phone was unlocked with 256GB.</br>",2019年12月4日 在美国审核

was a bit hesitant buying renewed but this phone is beyond amazing!,"So I ordered this phone in early January, using it rn to type this! i've been using it for about 3+ weeks now. I was pretty hesitant buying from amazon renewed since i’ve never purchased their refurbished products before. Before this phone i had been using an iPhone 7 plus for about 3 years so this definitely was a huge change!packaging: i do want to add amazon said it would take about a week to come with amazon prime but it came about 2 days early, which was really good. This phone came nicely packaged with a box from the company. They also provided a charger (an off brand one but it worked just fine)i purchased the rose gold with 64gb. I did realize this was the lowest amount of storage but i was coming from 128gb that was way too much for me, so this was definitely the perfect amount, not too little at all.Just the overall look of this phone is really nice and aesthetically pleasing. I really love how the screen takes up the whole phone and just looks really sleek and nice. This phone came with no scratches from what i could tell and looked in perfect condition. Face Id is also a really nice feature that works so quickly compared to touch ID.overall the price isn’t the cheapest but it’s definitely worth it in the long run. In my opinion, this is one of the best iphones to date (even better than the 11) and if you’re hesitant to buy this phone i would say just go for it because it’s by far the best phone i’ve had (((:",2020年1月21日 在美国审核

Thank you for selling great products!!! A++++,"I was concerned at first buying a renewed product from Amazon, but I have to say that the entire experience has exceeded my expectations. Not only does Amazon back the product for 90 days but the seller (buyspry) provided a product that was pretty much brand new!!! BUYSPRYS customer service was excellent. I originally bought two iPhone xs that arrived in practically brand new condition. Battery health were at 85 and 90%. After a few hours of usage I decided I actually preferred the xs max. So I bought two more phones from BuySpry and return the xs. I was refunded quickly by the seller. I received my 2 iPhone xs max and wow wow wow. I thought the first two phones were brand new. The iPhone xs max I received were absolutely brand new and as the pictures show battery health on both phones are 100%. almost forgot, the seller includeds screen protectors on the phone upon arrival. I will never buy a new iPhone again. When a phone cost more than my mortgage payment it kinda ridiculous. Thank you buyspry for supplying a fair price and an amazing product!!

"Was not Like New, not in excellent condition","I have always purchased renewed cell phones and never had a problem, until this time. This phone was supposed to be like new, in excellent condition, with minimal signs of wear. I had taken it out of the box, and it had a filmy cover on the front and back. I thought That was awesome until I suddenly noticed something looked amiss under the protective cover. I lifted it back to find a chip in the bottom of the screen with the telltale spider crack going out in several directions. Trying to give the seller the benefit of the doubt I held it out at arm’s length. Definitely noticeable. And a huge problem for the longevity of the phone. Scratches and dings are one thing. A chip in the screen with connecting cracks? Come on, now! I just paid over $700 for this phone and don’t need to go pay for a screen replacement on top of that plus all of the time and stress to go with it.<br><br>I immediately initiated a return request, which was approved and surprise again! I get to pay the return shipping on a product that arrived damaged and was not in the condition the seller promised it would be in.And now I’m left wondering if they will try to assess a restocking fee even though the phone doesn’t look like new and is not in excellent condition.I’m pretty upset at this.</br></br>",2020年3月11日 在美国审核

Additionally there were no scratches and the software seems fast and responsive. IMPORTANT NOTE:I saw a lot of reviews saying that people didn’t know this phone was locked to AT&amp;T which it is. Read the description it clearly says it is an AT&amp;T locked phone. I knew this when I bought it but thought I’d make that clear for everyone. Additionally unlocking an iPhone from AT&amp;T is super simply just visit Att.com/deviceunlock it’s that simple.Also STRAIGHT TALK does I repeat does work on this phone without the need to unlock, as long as you have the AT&amp;T network compatible SIM card.

Loos like new and works like new,"Maybe I'm cheap or old fashioned (or just old), but spending $1100 on a new iPhone sounds like a waste of money. But buying a used cell phone can be a challenging experience. There are always the bad reviews left by people that didn't get what they wanted or thought they ordered. There is always the worry about ""What if there is a hidden problem later?"" that plagues your mind. With the Amazon 90 return policy, I decided to take the chance and order one and I also ordered the 3 year product warranty. This phone looks as good as new. It seems to be 100% functional so far as well. With a 3 year extended warranty, it is better than buying new from Apple because new Apple products only have a 1 year warranty and they charge more for their extended warranty than Amazon charged me. So I got a ""looks like new"" and ""works like new"" iPhone with a 3 year warranty for $350 less than new. Sounds like a good deal for me. I'll definitely explore more reconditioned tech items from Amazon in the future.",2020年12月10日 在美国审核

Face Recognition works so great, it recognizes so fast even in night time.

The battery life is at (as shown in image) 94% capacity, which is higher than their minimum of 80%. There were NO scratches, dents or any other damage anywhere on the phone. It came with a protective screen sticker (removed when putting on real protector and case), and an actual apple brand charger/cord.I upgraded from an iPhone 6s 16gb to the iPhone XS Max 256gb. The set up was extremely easy - my SIM card fit into the new phone and I was able to wirelessly transfer everything from my old phone as well through the prompted set up screens.The volume is WAY better than my old phone. Like, in a huge and substantial way. It's amazing. The screen is, obviously, bigger and the quality is definitely way superior. The phone is fast, connected to my bluetooth devices without any problems, and connected to my Mac automatically when I signed into my Apple ID.16gb on my old phone wasn't enough for apps and to keep up with current software updates - now I am able to complete updates without worrying I will have to delete things. As minuscule as it is, playing Pokemon go used to have issues with it's AR mode (which directly related to the phone and software updates not being performed) and now there's no issues at all.

"Perdi todo mi dinero, tengan cuidado.","NO COMPRARLES, TENGAN CUIDADO.Desde febrero hice la compra sobre este producto para finales de ese mes lo recibí, resulta que en ese paquete vino un Samsung Galaxy S7 Active con un cargador de iPhone, el paquete venia sellado con las etiquetas de Avianca aun como que no lo tocaron o abrieron, adjunto las imágenes (borre los datos por seguridad).Esta empresa dice que no vende Samsung, hace poco vi una publicación en su tienda que tenían varios Samsung. Al tener este problema inmediatamente me comunique con Amazon para ver que tocaba hacer, se hizo la apelación del reembolso perfecto lo aceptaron ellos y me mandaron las etiquetas para devolver el pedido, se habló por teléfono que mandar ese artículo era costoso y que igual iban a dar el reembolso de lo que gaste ya que era un gasto innecesario, seguí todos los pasos de Amazon, rápido mande el artículo, después ellos decían que no habían recibido nada, cuando el paquete lo firmo alguien de esa empresa misma persona que me contestaba correos, desde ahí se puede notar que no querían ser responsables por sus actos, ya verifique el paquete con el número del tracking y si llego a mi dirección, pero cómo es posible que le pongan $100 por si se pierde ese artículo, ni siquiera yo le puse que costaba eso a un teléfono de tan bajo valor.......si eso fue lo que recibí no sé cómo esperaban que yo mandara un XS Max si nunca lo tuve, algo ilógico por no decir otra palabra.... Solicite el IMEI del teléfono para rastrearlo y no me proporcionaron esa información, en qué momento le tiran la culpa a un cliente por comprar un producto, al final me decían que yo era el culpable de eso, o sea… En ningún momento dice “Reembolso total”, me ofrecieron un “Reembolso parcial” y no por lo que había comprado, sino por un feedback que les hice, les importaba más el review, claro así no se dan cuenta las demás personas de como son, yo sabía que al quitar ese feedback esa empresa iba a deshacerse de mi como si nada.Sean más responsables y los denunciare por redes sociales para que se den cuenta de cómo son.",2020年6月18日 在美国审核
Absolutely nothing wrong with it!,"Looks brand new and battery life is exceptional! I don’t use facial recognition but it does work perfectly. Apple still has a ways to go to achieve really top notch photos. I’ve been using a Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 with its 16 megapixel camera and it is much farther along in all categories but the XS Max is usable for now. Apple needs to step up their sensor development to stay competitive. Everything else is nice to use. I still find it weird that the word intuitive is used to describe iOS software. I find Android to be more to my liking. But I switch every few years and Apple seemed fun to try again. Staying away from the Two-Factor trap, though. When you try to change to another platform it’s an exercise in frustration to get your phone number released. I had to register a whole new Apple ID. But very happy with the company and the actual phone.",2020年12月19日 在美国审核
It’s ok. Too expensive considering flaws.,"My biggest worry was that it wouldn’t work with US Cellular. But in three minutes they had popped in a new card and had added it to my line, no problem at all. I was surprised to see that it had 100% battery capacity. I couldn’t find a scratch or dent anywhere on it. It literally looks and performs like a brand new phone. I highly recommend buying from this seller. It may not be new but it definitely seems like it. With my budget I could either get a really good older iPhone or a basic cheap new(ish) one. I’m so glad I chose to buy refurbished.After having it a few months, I’m not quite as giddy. The flaws aren’t enough to make me regret having this phone; I just regret paying so much for it. This phone has two issues. 1) The lower volume button does not push in or pop out. It’s like it’s just there for looks. The increase volume button works fine. So I have to swipe down on the screen to lower the volume. Not ideal but it can be lived with. 2) Occasionally the playback is garbled on videos I record. There’s no rhyme or reason; sometimes the recorded sound just goes out. Playback is silent or muffled with electronic sounds at random times. The microphone and sound are great when I’m talking on it.I find it hard to believe these flaws were not noticed during the refurb. Then again, it took me a while to fully notice them. Again, I don’t mind that this is my phone. I’m ok with it. But it should have at least $100 less than what I paid.",2021年11月7日 在美国审核

I have been looking on every website and even face book market place, but felt better using Amazon since I can return if anything was wrong. I got the phone days before the anticipated date or arrival. The phone has no scratches, nothing is functionally wrong with the phone. Also came with a screen protector installed.

Much more than I expected,"Although a renewed item at an excellent price, this phone arrived in pristine condition. No sign of wear at all and not a mark on it. 95% Battery life. I had an issue with the blue tooth that I resolved by reseting the Network Settings. Amazon tech support was excellent but ended up handing me off to the seller when we couldn't seem to rectify the problem. The seller responded very quickly...but with a busier than usual volume message (we seem to get a lot those lately). I did the network reset on my own and let the seller know. They responded right away and said to contact them again if I have any other issues. Over all I'm very happy with both Amazon and the seller's responses. I absolutely love this phone. I thought it might be too big, but my old eyes really appreciate the larger screen.",2022年2月3日 在美国审核
Legitamate,"Got the max specked option. Came unlocked as mentioned, paired with boost mobile under a preexisting family plan. I ended up needing a new simcard to connect the iphone, costed little over $10 buying direct from the boost website. Activation, well you can look up how to do that. Otherwise working great and then some. Battery came in at 99% its original capacity, so if you're a perfectionist well so much for that. I'm fine with it, full charge lasts me a full day of use.After it was all said and done, (including sim and shipping, no activation fee) this costed little over $500 cheaper than if buying new directly (compared to black friday prices).

My main phone,"So far this has been my main phone for about two weeks since receiving it through the mail. It’s completely unlocked and affordable . The battery life is definitely decent 6-7 hours of heavy usage. The Oled screen is absolutely gorgeous and the blacks look beautiful.Pros &amp; ConsConsTwo camera setup - for me the camera is amazing from the older iPhone I had before but for some people the two camera setup could be outdated compared to the other iPhones on the market.It’s a 2018 IPhone!! So your by purchasing this phone you have to understand the chipset and form factor is already 3 years old.ProsSCREEN QUALITY- THE OLED LOOKS INCREDIBLE WHILE GAMING, WATCHING MOVIES &amp; simply web browsing.The processor is still packs plentyof power even if it’s the 2018 A12 Bionic chip. The phone is still snappy and still very fast.There’s really no cons to this phone and the shipper even put a glass protector on the phone for me. So I have zero complaints and in two months I’m purchasing another device from this shipper.Last thing! If your coming from a IPhone XR, 8plus, 7 plus then this price for under $330 for a IPhone XS Max unlocked and still getting updates until 2026 is definitely worth it!",2022年5月15日 在美国审核

IPHONE XS MAX wold from BUYSPRY- AMAZING CONDITION,"iPhone XS MAX 258gb Space Gray - Sold from BUYSPRYThis review is for anyone who is skeptical about buying a refurbished IPhone from amazon renewed- Chillax. Theses phones are GREAT.Specifically from the seller “BUYSPRY”Honestly so impressed with the quality I received the phone in. I looked and looked and looked and I can’t find a single scratch, dent, error anywhere. It appears whoever previously owned this device either returned it without even using it or didn’t even take it out of the box. The battery health is at an amazing 100% which I was not expecting at all. After being so skeptical about it for a week straight I finally decided to try it out and boy am I glad I did. I can’t reiterate enough how good the condition is.**Remember not all phones come from the same company that refurbishes them. Some companys have better reputations than others so make sure you check all of them and chose the one you feel the most comfortable with. Also remember- Higher price DOES NOT necessarily mean higher quality. Mine was $700 and it’s FLAWLESS**",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Perfect condition iPhone.,"The phone is immaculate. BuySPRY practically sold me a brand new iPhone. It has almost little to no scratches if looked at closely, and has absolutely no issues. I recommend the buyer. The only issue I have which isn’t much of a real problem at all is that the phone doesn’t come with headphones. I don’t have an iPhone headphone adapter so it’s annoying a bit. Otherwise the phone is great and the charger isn’t cheap, it works well. If you are skeptical about buying a renewed iPhone, just do your research on the sellers. Also my phone battery health is at 96% which is pretty good to me. It lasts all day until 3 am with normal use.After about 8 months of continuous FaceTime use the iPhone has problems functioning on facetime and crashes everything when it’s overheated and sometimes the brightness fails and doesn’t fix itself.",2020年5月20日 在美国审核
I’m Truly Amazed,"I have to say this phone is way beyond my expectations. When I was making the purchase I was looking at it said renewed model. My expectations were not completely high. I was thinking it will have some types of scratches or something to indicate some sort of use. This phone was way past like new when I got it. It looks like someone used it for a few hours or so and decided to send it back. THIS iPhone XS Max has no visual defects as far as I can see. The battery when I looked was 100% overall and in the description it says at least 80%. I was not expecting this phone to be so perfect. When I was setting up the phone and doing the face lock I was all smiles the whole time. I say and all honesty I am able to get over 24 hours of battery. The battery is overpowered. I will state I have Max at full brightness all day long and the battery is still good. I’m not a heavy user but if you are a casual user like me then this phone will get you through. I don’t know if you will get one from the same seller as I did, but if you have the chance I have the feeling you will get a good one. It feels so good in the hands. I was coming from a iPhone 7 and when I held Max it was like fate. I have big hands so this is perfect on all fronts. If you have big hands and you’re looking for a nice size phone then this phone will get it done.",2020年7月9日 在美国审核
"Apple Iphone XS Max, 512GB, Silver – Fully Unlocked (Renewed)","Apple Iphone XS Max, 512GB, Silver – Fully Unlocked (Renewed)<br>Sold by: Gryphon CommerceUsed IPhone are expensive so I always purchase them as Amazon fulfilled (which are rear these day) or amazon Renewed. That is my insurance policy against ripped off by 3rd party sellers.Battery health is at 90% which is not bad for a used phone. Condition of the phone is excellent. It has been a over a month now and is performing as expected (no identifiable defects).In the past few years, I have had to invest in used IPhones for my kids because American school kids have formed a “closed IPhone network”. If your kid does not have an IPhone, then they are left out of the Facetiming and group chats. Many of them do not even know of Android. The closest thing they know of an android is a Samsung.As a parent, all you can do is to ask you kid to suck it up and use his or her being avoided/left-out, to study. But life does not work like that for Gen Z. They are so sensitive to belonging at this age that you don’t want to add to their stress and depression by adding to their isolation from friends just because they can’t be reach by Facetime or the exclusive iPhone chat groups. So, as a concerned parent, and for the sanity of your child, you hit the used IPhone market for affordability while I myself continue to use a cheapo Android phone.Going through this process for 3 teenage kids, I have learned a few lessons.Thoroughly check the performance of every function immediately after you receive your phone. Your return window starts counting down the day it is delivered. I find TestM (Check Phone &amp; Report App) very useful. It will test every functionality on your IPhone. Start using your phone immediately so that if there is a defect that is unacceptable, you may catch it before it is too late.Although the price of IPhones are exorbitant, I have grown to appreciate their value. The first IPhone I purchased was in November, 2016, an Apple iPhone 6s Plus 128GB Unlocked(Certified Refurbished), Almost 5 years after it release, it has received all updates and is running the latest IOS 13. You don’t get such long support life from most android phones (except probably Google Pixel). It has gone through 3 screen replacement and it is still prodding on.</br>",2020年6月19日 在美国审核

"iPhone Xs Max, Space Grey GSM Unlocked","My Amazon Renewed (refurb) iPhone buying experience.I'll assume that anyone considering shelling out for an iPhone will have at least done some cursory research &amp; knows the actual features of the phone, so I'm just going to speak to the condition &amp; functionality of the specific phone that I received.First off, the unit arrived on time. I opened the box, removed the plastic &amp; closely examined the phone, repeatedly. For all intents, &amp; purposes, it was cosmetically a new phone. The only real, tangible sign of use is that the max battery life is at 91%. Touch screen, camera, calls, video &amp; music playback, all great (&amp; that speaker, coming form an iPhone 6 Plus... Wow!). Shiny new iPhone with a big fat phablet screen. I ordered it in April; it's now early July &amp; I've had no issues.

Perfect condition!,Came in mint condition. Practically new. Fully unlocked so I could just swap my StraightTalk SIM card over and use my old iPhone to transfer it easily. 256GB storage is amazing. Camera quality it’s out of this world. I love it! Only downside was the shipping time. It took a little bit longer than the typical Prime Free Two-Day shipping.

Mine was thrown in a padded envelope no box, no paperwork with a short little bad idea of a USB wire but that didn't bother me cause I had an old apple wire I use. I've done 2 software updates on it plus installed all my apps and it works perfectly. I would recommend this phone, it's great!",2021年5月4日 在美国审核
Better than I expected worth the risk.,"Is my first time buying a renewed IPhone since im upgrading from iPhone 7 plus to XS Max, I crossed my fingers to hope the phone actually work percectly, when I opened it is look almost like brand new phone like condition, I was surprised I thought is going be just a clean phone with fews scuffs etc it actually looks flawless when I recieved it, when I turned on it works pretty smooth no problems at all just start off fresh. Anyway I’m happy with my new phone I just purchased and it’s worth the risk to buy renewed iPhone from 3rd party seller, and also it came a day earlier.",2020年8月28日 在美国审核
Relieved and very happy about my purchase!,"I had to buy a new phone after my 6s finally decided to give out on me. I didn’t want to buy a new phone at full price, but was initially nervous about putting the money down on a refurbished phone that wasn’t directly sold by Apple.<br>It was a great decision! The shipping was fast and the package was well wrapped and protected. The phone looked practically new and came with a screen protector already installed. The battery was even charged when I turned it on, so that was a plus. Works exactly as it should, and I had no problem popping my SIM card in and using my cell service after restarting the device (I use straight talk) so the phone was truly unlocked.Overall a great experience, I got exactly what I paid for (color, size, gb) and I couldn’t be happier!</br>",2020年5月10日 在美国审核
A,"Best Experience for 2 reasons-1. ""I purchased through Amazon"" and 2.They are ""a Trusted Seller"". I have not had to call them, all was done online. Service has been GREAT!It was a big risk but seller did not disappoint. My Iphone XS Max, arrived sooner than expected, it very discretely and securely packaged, aesthetically pleasing, it was spotless and ready to go, fully charged and ready to go! It is beautiful and of great quality!!! I purchased the insurance plan but have not had to use it, but feel confident that with this seller and Amazon, if I ever run across a problem, they will not hesitate to fix it. Truly Grateful, unlike other sites, Amazon waited months before inviting me to review my phone purchase/experience, naturally allowing me time to use it, so I was looking forward to posting an honest review. Very Happy Customer! :)",2020年8月28日 在美国审核

I've tested every feature and all are working.The SIM from my iPhone 5c worked immediately when I powered it up and went through the setup, and I made my first call within three minutes of opening the box.I saved at least $450 in buying a renewed phone instead of a new one, yet I essentially have a new phone.I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.",2019年12月3日 在美国审核

Fluently Smooth Speed &amp; Loving It!,"So far, everything with this phone, has been impeccable, and I haven’t had any technical difficulties at all. The only minor con that I would infer to is that it didn’t include any earphones for the iPhone XS Max; but that wasn’t anything I really worried about. I just purchased a Lightning Headphone Jack Adapter, so I could transfer other earphones with the device universally, so that’s what alternative I used to get around the missing headphones in the box. There also wasn’t a SIM eject tool either, but thankfully, I had one from my iPhone 6s Plus I bought. Nonetheless, the iPhone XS Max itself has been a very immaculate powerhouse, with the 512 GB internal storage, and the 4GB of RAM that has the phone operating at a unique speed. There may be some negative and dismal reviewers that didn’t like theirs, but don’t fret over their reviews; I’d say that it’s up to you to make that finalized decision for yourself.

I would definitely buy another phones in the future,I was very skeptical about ordering a iPhone from Amazon Renewed but I decided to do it. It was in almost perfect condition the only type of wear on it was around the speakers and charging port where you could see a case had been at one point. The screen was perfect without any scratches which really surprised me. The phone look almost brand new. The only think I wasn’t extremely happy about was how it was packaged. It was in a phone box with bubble wrap around the iPhone and that was the only type of protection it had. But rather than that it is a great product. The shipping was very fast I got it in 4 days. If your not for sure about buying it just do it. And even if it not in good condition you can return like my sister did because it wasn’t in very good condition and they sent her a new one and if I didn’t know better I would have said it was brand new.,2020年8月21日 在美国审核

They provide an appropriate charger, mine had a screen protector on as well. It was in great shape, no scratches that you could even notice (I took screen protector off to inspect better and put my own on). Keep in mind every phone is going to be different, it depends on the shape of the phone when they receive it and how to person turning it in took care of it.

The phone itself was in perfect condition on the outside. (Looks Brand new) but once I powered the device up it would intermittently shut itself off and it was frustrating. Once I got the phone to stay on long enough to set it up there was a warning saying it wasnt an apple original battery and it wouldnt work right. I am going to send it back in and request a refund because the phone didn't even function like its supposed to. Aesthetically it's perfect but it doesnt function correctly.

I love this iPhone and would recommend the seller to everyone!,"At first I was very skeptical of buying a refurbished iPhone because (1) I read a couple of negative reviews about the seller and (2) I've heard horror stories of customers buying a refurbished iPhone (from any seller) and couldn't use it. But I found a great price on the XS Max and decided to take the plunge and order it. Now I have no regrets of buying this iPhone! The phone is practically brand new.. it arrived in excellent condition, and it was easy to transfer my info from the 7 Plus to this. The only thing is the battery got really hot during the initial setup process. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. Otherwise, I love it! If you want to buy an iPhone at a reduced price, I highly recommend this seller.. you won't be disappointed!",2020年5月31日 在美国审核

Poor QC - Speaker Issues,"I knew that a used phone is ""used"" so I tempered my expectations but what I received was not worth the money spent.<br>The phone was acceptable in all exterior aspects except for a large section on the lower corner where it was obviously dropped against concrete or asphalt due to the pitting involved. The screen was good and without issue.The battery will last about 5-6hrs with moderate use and a check says it is at 85% capacity (still acceptable).The speakers were my major issue. This phone was water damaged, no doubt what so ever. The speakers were horribly muffled and the sound quality was atrocious. I was going to return but I spend 3 days playing music at full volume along with downloading a ""sonic"" app. After the 3rd day, the speakers are acceptable although nowhere near what they should be.Overall this purchase should have been $100 less than it was. This phone is not refurbished, it was cleared and boxed up after someone turned it in.Look elsewhere, this is not a good purchase.</br>",2021年1月31日 在美国审核

Poor policies - wasted my time,"The sticker on the back of this phone said it was not tested. It came to no surprise that this phone had a half green screen when I turned it on.Company tried to make ME pay for the return shipping of their defective product. I sorted it out with customer service (at first they implied that I should pay it because “it’s only like 6 or 7 dollars” - but agreed to reimburse me if I included receipt for shipping). It’s the principle!They wasted my time. They didn’t take the time to test their product and then cost me my time to call them, buy a new gift instead, go to the post office to mail (they don’t offer pre-paid labels), write my first Amazon review, etc...They should offer pre-paid labels, test their phones and not charge return shipping for defective products. I wouldn’t do business with a company like this ever again. Treat your customers better!!",2021年1月3日 在美国审核

Fully refurbished and looks like new!,"I was a bit nervous when I made the purchase but I read reviews and compare on the company's site to Amazon and what I found was they graded their products based on ware and tear. The higher the price on their site, the item was closer to practically new and the lower the price, they had some scuff so keep that in mind and compare both amazon and the supplier's site.The package was not in the amazon box as I originally thought and came with anon-apple charge base but I had my own. The phone looked practically new with no scuff marks so I was very pleased that for the price, I got such a nice phone. I am researching another for my spouse as well instead of going to Apple. You can find way more attractive prices with 3rd party vendors, just be sure to do your comparative research.",2020年3月7日 在美国审核
REFURBISHED Xs MAX A DEAL ?,"I reached out to seller prior to purchase and specified model for XsMax- global unlocked phone. Seller responded in time but could not guarantee a specific model yet promised global unlocked version. I took a chance on this expensive model and am happy. Build, battery life, aesthetics were like new , no visible damage . It came with screen protector pre-applied and off market charger- lightening cable. I waited for full month to post this review to see how it performed and likesaid I am happy so far. I can provide update if there is a issue in 90 days later. I will recommend and buy again from this seller.",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Great value,I bought this phone for my son and it arrived in pretty much perfect condition. He’s been using it for about a month without any issues at all. I was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone online but I’m so glad I did. The price was reasonable and I had every confidence that since this came from Amazon directly that I wouldn’t have any issues returning or exchanging it if I needed too. The OLED screen is my sons favorite feature and the reason he wanted this model specifically. I’m considering switching myself after seeing the difference lol. The battery arrived at 94% capacity which is exceptionally good for a refurbished phone. I would definitely recommend this option for anyone who doesn’t want to spend an arm and a leg on a brand new phone.,2021年7月5日 在美国审核
battery is dying fast,"It seems like there is something wrong with the battery! the first day I checked the battery life it was 98% so I was happy, a week later its 96%, 3 weeks passed it's on 90% of its health! I wonder what it would be after 2-3 months, 50%?",2020年2月16日 在美国审核
Buy without fear,"First of all, the seller has a full 90-day refund policy, so you don't need to worry that you will get stuck with a problem phone.Having said that, replacing and setting up a phone is a pain, which we had to do.My girlfriend and I each bought one.For mine, everything was great except that I could not get visual voice mail to work, despite numerous calls to Verizon and Apple customer support.Verizon told me that it is not a Verizon phone, so that may be the problem.Each time someone called or left a voicemail, I would receive a text message of gibberish.I would have to call *86 to hear if I got a message.I ended up giving the phone to my son since he doesn't use voicemail.My girlfriend's phone had no problem with visual voicemail -- also through Verizon -- but she had a different issue.Callers could not be understood on 3-way calls, which her family is doing a lot of right now to settle her father's estate.Ultimately, she exchanged it for the same phone from the seller.Also, you should note that the screens you get may not be original Apple, which I don't think is a problem.All the phones get shipped with a screen protector over them.The technician in the Verizon store peeled ours off so that we could inspect the screen.He said protectors can hide scratches.In our case, the screens looked fine when we held them up to the light.From a certain angle, we could see a tiny blemish with the phone off,but it was imperceptiblewhen using the phone.You may want to inspect your screen carefully when getting the phone.In the end, we got two renewed phones for less than one phone's price at Verizon.Buying this renewed phone is well worth any time it takes to return it if something is off.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核
Worth The Price For The Quality,"I always said “When my 6+ can’t make phone calls any longer, I’ll buy a new iPhone”.Well, I had the second battery swell in this model iPhone. It just pleads apart on the left side. This one is the second one from Apple to replace the original battery “belly”.This iPhone was received in spotless condition. It could have been packaged in the original box &amp; it would pass as brand new. Working great - have to get used to the no button arrangement.",2021年7月22日 在美国审核
Terrible phone,"What a mess it’s making of my personal info/sites, apps, texts, etc…Lost several good features I liked on the 7Plus.Supposed to have tons more storage, but now Apple is telling me I cancelled my storage (I didn’t) and wants me to RE subscribe for more stoeage cuz phone can’t back up anything. What happened to all this storage??Storage was the reason I bought the phone in the first place!!!I think I’m gonna return it…not worth the price",2021年6月11日 在美国审核
"Worked like new, looked like new (from the front)","I was pleasantly surprised at the phone's aesthetic condition; it looked nearly new even up close, with a few minor, hard to see scrapes or scuffs on the back (not on the screen or bezel). Works like new, all the accessories work like new, battery seems to work as well as a new XS Max's should, everything seems to be running well.Only thing I would ask the seller for is maybe a guide or a link to a guide on how to activating the phone (especially for items like this that are locked so certain carriers)? This was my first time using a locked phone and it took a surprising amount of frustration for me to just unlock it and restore it from an iCloud backup on a Mac. Not the seller's fault I didn't know that though, and there was nothing wrong with the phone whatsoever - it came exactly as well as advertised.All in all very pleased!",2020年8月26日 在美国审核

Pudo ser un Poco mejor...,"Compré este Xs Max un sábado y me llego un miércoles (eso que tenía prime), Luego llegó en una caja súper fea muy débil, mala presentación y eso que escogí al vendedor según su crítica “Kiss Electronics Inc” que parecía tener buenas críticas. Lo malo de su presentación es que el dispositivo llego con un temperd glass y estaba quebrado, me asusté tanto por que pensé que era la pantalla ya que es de esos temperd glass que cubren toda la pantalla y me costo distinguir del susto por lo quebrado, ya quitándole eltemperd glass quebrado, revise sus bordes y estaba impecables, luego la parte trasera tiene marcas por uso (extraas) pero no son visibles tan fácilmente hay que tocarlo para darse cuenta de esas marcas de eso, la pantalla tiene algunos rasguos por uso pero ya con un Temperd Glass del mismo que venía queda excelente, conforme a su autonomía vino con la condición de la batería al 96%, desbloqueado de fábrica, el cargador era genérico así como lo anunciaron pero no me importo ya que compré un cargador carga rápida aukey, la batería está excelente, la pantalla es OLED y es una maravilla, no ha sido abierto, pero he notado que subiendo los altavoces el sonido suele distorsionarse un poco, no se si es normal. Para el precio que me lo vendieron esta bien, esperaba algo un poco mejor pero cumple con lo prometido, tal vez una recomendación sobre la manera en la que lo empacan, ya que he comprado un iPhone X normal de otro vendedor y ese venía tan excelente hasta una regalía de un Cover y un glass, todo bien cuidado en una caja súper fuerte, pero en cambio esté más bien me dio miedo por qué hay una pequea probabilidad de que el producto lo lleguen a quebrar por un mal empaquetado.Si tengo algún problema actualizare..PDTA: el celular lo ocupare en Centroamérica",2020年3月14日 在美国审核
Great!!,"Was hesitant to try buying renewed, and even more so when it wasn’t Prime, but I purchased from NetworkStore and battery is 100%, no damage to the phone whatsoever, Face ID is flawless, and the display is perfect. It came with an offbrand lightning cable and wall charger, and no headphones, but that’s very minor at this point and they work just fine. Swapped SIM card and everything activated right away. Would recommend (especially with the 90 day guarantee)!",2020年7月27日 在美国审核
"Good for ""Renewed.""","It's perhaps been close to 2 months now since I've made this purchase. First off, my phone usage is not extensive, only limited to text, calls, uncomplicated photo-taking, YT and Streaming.Performance-wise this is not bad at all. Screen is clear, photos taken are crisp and true to the 24mpx, it's good even for distance and etc. Battery life is above average, better than my Samsung (sorry), if I do have to have an ongoing conference or streaming and internet use, I have to plug it in just for my own security. Roughly the battery life lasts 1.5 days without internet use.Pretty much meets my needs. But I need to mention that it has blacked out without warning 3x already, total power off,all of those times occurred while the phone was charging, strange that...Most importantly here! - this did not come w/ the original power charger cord (Apple product). It came w/ another brand and it is problematic, in fact I am fearful when I use it because in truth, it is not compatible. Maybe compatible in terms of the physical connections but it's like it's being 'rejected"" when it's already plugged in. I am using an ipad charger for my phone and it works.",2021年1月29日 在美国审核

GREAT VALUE FOR A GREAT PHONE,Battery health came at 100% which is very impressive for one of these refurbished products. Also the condition was Like New with a couple scratches on the screen. Adding a glass protector took away the look of any scratches on the screen so if you plan to add one the screen should look flawless. The back and edge of the phone look great. Everything’s worked really smooth so far and I’m happy with my purchase.,2021年3月22日 在美国审核
"Was cautious, but amazing purchase.","Due to all the negative comments and reviews i was hesitant to buy this refurbished and was worrisome the entire time it was on its way to my house. When it arrived it was sealed alright, not the best but wasnt losely packed in anyway. What i found was very suprising. Phone was reset correctly, in beautiful shape, no scratches on front or back, full functionality and 100% battery health. Yet it did have a few wear marks on the corners of the phone (not on the screen, the edges) it was 100% worth it and i wouldve prolly put those there in the first month anyway. This phone was in someones hand for a handful of weeks if that it looks like. If every phone comes in the condition i got mine in, id say this is a steal. If anything goes wrong i will update, but so far, 10/10.",2020年5月14日 在美国审核
"Arrives Like New, Cheaper Battery Parts…","So… The initial unboxing was very pleasing. Firm packaging and well put together.

The screen seemed to be original OLED and what seemed to be pristine original casing and parts but the battery. Shocked to find out the drop in battery life from what I believe to be a cheaper battery. No I don’t use fast chargers, I use original Apple charger cable and block to avoid the drop in overall battery life, but here we are. It’s where my prior phone’s daily battery life was at. It’s understandable to fix up with cheaper alternative parts but I would think Amazon would’ve gone higher quality parts.",2021年6月15日 在美国审核
Best phone that I have owned!,"Love this phone!Lots of memory, great price and easy to set up.It did not come with a SIM card but that took 5 minutes to correct.I would make this purchase again in a heartbeat! It came in the original box and all of the normal Apple stuff inside.",2020年1月29日 在美国审核
Great Deal,Wow! I was a bit Leary to buy a refurbished phone. And this seller had an 80% positive rate which I was also Leary of. I went ahead anyway due to amazons return policy for this phone. And wow! This phone looks like new. Not a smudge or scratch anywhere. I even had to peel plastic off the screen. Sure it was in an aftermarket box with an aftermarket charger but I use aftermarket chargers already anyway. This was a great deal. This phone is awesome!,2021年3月27日 在美国审核
iPhone XS Max review,I will say for buying two of these phones both were in excellent physical condition. Everything worked properly from the Amazon Premium renewed box. Bought mine in April of this year and they still work. I will be honest I wad expecting to be ripped off but I was surprised on how good of condition the phones were physically on the body and the screen. I would suggest the premium renewed version if you want the phone to be more flawless physically. All in all happy with my purchase.,2021年10月13日 在美国审核

Looks good,"So I got a long extended charger with my phone, which I thought was a plus, rather than the short original one. Until I put my new phone charge and it didn’t charge. Thanks for a BROKEN charger.As for the phone itself, seems like everything’s good. Last phone I bought from Amazon turned on and everything but once I put the SIM card in it still said no sim, no network. Took it to Verizon, the gave us a new SIM and still nothing. So I’m just waiting for my SIM card to come in to make sure everything works!",2020年7月2日 在美国审核
Iphone review.,"Iphone came quick, had some issues. Can't really say it was a bad phone but can't say it was a good phone either.Well deserve 3 stars. Not bad. The iphone came perfect. Hardly any visible scratches or dings. The only draw back about the phone is the speakers from the bottom and ear piece appeared to be damaged. The sounded shot like a car speaker that went bad. Tried to clean it thinking it was dirty and nothing. The seller which is very professional gave me some options if I wanted a replacement or refund with expedite shipping but this refurbished phone is like a gamble, waiting for this device to ship out and a new device to come in would be about a week and half turn around. Customer service is top knotch. Please note that the iphones dont come with original charger or charge box nor ear buds/ may come which dont. Now the screen and other functionality where perfect as it came be. No glitches, cracks etc. No lagging nor dead pixels. The touch was very responsive.The screen felt oem and not after market. (After market screens tend to have a discoloration in the quality response and depth of color of the screen, the words are not as crisp and tend to have a amber affect look rather then the iphone bright white). Charging port is perfect and battery life was at 93 percent which is perfect almost new. Such a shame I had to return it but will do business is the future for other phones.",2020年10月26日 在美国审核
Pick your seller carefully,"So, to start off with, it's an iPhone Xs Max. If you're looking for a review of the phone itself, skip this one. I ordered and I was very worried seeing a lot of people posting reviews about the condition of the phone they received. I carefully selected my seller who had a 90% positive review status, and while paying about 20 bucks over the lowest price, received a phone in what can only be called excellent condition. I would not be surprised if you told me the previous owner bought it and didnt take it out of its box during the entire duration of his ownership. The battery health was measured by the phone at 95% and it has no problems lasting me all day, and the exterior is completely flawless. Not a scratch, not a scuff, nothing. I did however take off a point for presentation. I was greeted with a fairly beat up cardboard box, and a generic charger that was dirty and a NON MFI power brick (I had bought a fast charger from anker at the same time anyway, highly recommend). All in all though, I would rather the seller skimp on the stuff that's not necessary or easily dealt with, especially when they're giving you a phone of phenomenal quality at a price that competes strongly with refurbishers who put far less effort into renewing phones",2020年3月9日 在美国审核

Pretty reasonable referb,"The phone ended up coming a day earlier than expected which is always good. When opening the box the phone did come with a charging cable and adapter, but in my case the adapter that It came with was not a fast charging brick and did not work. Big woop I have my own so no biggie there. Upon closer inspection of the display there was some small bump like scratches on the top right of the screen and back of the device. Almost like the previous owner keep it without a case in their pocket with some hard objects like keys. I'll be honest It's not really that noticable unless you tilt it on a 85 degree angle. Now onto battery. They did promise no less than 80% and mine was at 83% which is kind of a bummer but not too bad especially considering how hard it is too find this old of a device with a perfect battery. The speakers are kind of weird. Like the earpiece when you listen to music it has kind of a high pitched scream that only a younger person would be able to hear. It's not bad but not as good of quality as my OEM bought iPhone XR. Overall for this price point I would get one if you want a newer iDevice with an OLED display if you don't want to shell out thousands of dollars for a new shiny phone.",2022年2月22日 在美国审核

Marginally acceptable.,"This refurbishedtelephone functions at the low level of acceptability. Almost everything about it is substandard from what I would expect. The Camera functionality is marginal. The screen quality is at the same level. The battery life is probably what should be expected from a refurbished product.The biggest problem encountered was the fact that when the phone was restored from the cloud, Apple apparently thought it was a foreign device from another market area. They kept locking me out. I tried to reach technical support for the Amazon seller and received the usual next week maybe answer. That situation is nothing short of maddening. I tried to work with Apple. Since I am a half technical guy I was able to fool around with it until I finally resolvedthe matter although I’m not sure how. Perhaps perseverance? But may God help people who don’t have the ability to deal with those kind of things. That because there is no technical support to speak of.It’d be said that the level of customer service from Amazon shellers is generally awful. I’ve made this point in several reviews. It is ironic because a big portion of Amazon’s success has to do with their service but they don’t expect their sellers to come even close.And if you’ve ever heard the runaround try to talk to Amazon customer service about their sellers. You will get a lot of niceties and no help.",2022年5月10日 在美国审核
An ALMOST Like-New Experience,"To summarize, here’s my experience buying this product:The packaging is solid and the box came with a charger and sim ejector.The phone’s condition was decent, not perfect but good. There were a few micro-scratches on the back and slightly deep annoying little scratch on the notch, and it is also worth noting that the speaker grill was dirty upon arrival, but nothing else cosmetically. In terms of the condition of the battery, the phone displayed a battery health oh 86% capacity with isn’t bad.The phone functioned completely as expected, like a new phone. All the features work fine and it seems to perform like any other phone of its kind would.Overall: I’d recommend it. There is good value in buying this phone refurbished, and I believe it is worth the money. I’m a bit upset about the previously mentioned notch scratch and 86% battery health, but overall, it is still a great deal if you have weak phone and are in need of an upgrade.",2022年2月10日 在美国审核

Good coming from the 6S,"This Iphone XS Max works as intended, really easy to setup if you are coming from a older gen version.Everything on mine works well, and overall cosmetics are in perfect condition. Looks like the previous owner had a case on and installed (still on) screen protector.At first glance the battery life indicated 100% health, after a day of usage it dropped to about 92%. Not a big deal, its a used phone, if it need be you can always replace the battery if you want. Coming from the 6S the XS outperforms by a long shot. I get about 8 hours of mixed screen time per charge, which should last you throughout the day with one charge. I thought I would miss Touch ID/fingerprint but the FaceID works very well. And the lack of AUX port is unfortunate but I come to realize bluetooth technology sounds a lot better than the ones years ago.The thing is you might get one with blemishes or different battery life, it all depends on the seller so make sure to check their description. Otherwise this is a good phone, I just wished my refurbished unit had a new battery,",2020年2月14日 在美国审核

FAULTY Dot Projector,"All in all the phone was a very good value and at the price it was I was super sketched, but I bought it and I've used it for a few hours. The Amazon ad said it was renewed and in near new working order, HOWEVER, the Dot Projector is broken and therefore Face ID and portrait mode with the front camera will not work and there is a 1% chance of it being repaired. I have been a loyal Amazon shopper and a loyal Apple consumer, I feel this listing was falsely advertised, as the phone was described as ""Professionally inspected and tested to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by an Amazon-qualified supplier, who is not Apple certified."" It also said the supplier performs a full diagnostic test, replaces any defective parts, and throughly cleans the product. A broken Dot Projector tells me this product was either NOT fully tested, as whoever tested it would've also found out that since the Dot Projector is broken, the portrait mode on the front camera does not work, OR it was tested and knowingly sold with a broken Dot Projector. I normally don't even write reviews, however I feel people deserve to know that the attractive price of this phone comes at the sacrifice of Face ID and Portrait Mode with the front camera.

Pretty disappointed for almost $600 (in depth review),"(I am a tech reviewer, so I notice a lot more than an average person would) Upon receiving the phone I noticed a major red flag when one of the pentalope screws on the bottom of the phone was hanging out because it wasn’t screwed all the way in and the screen was raised slightly and sticking out of the body of the phone. It was at that moment that my heart dropped as I wondered of all things that they could have changed out for cheaper parts. Not only is the screen, not oem, but the battery isn’t either. This phone was supposed to come with an OLED screen which is one of the main reasons I bought this phone over the xr or iPhone 11, but it’s obvious that this screen is just a cheap lcd panel. 3D Touch is useless, and it’s not very bright compared to the oem panel. Moving to the battery, it’s decent right now as it is a new battery, but I’m scared for long term reliability of it, because I haven’t had a very good experience with aftermarket phone batteries. Besides all of those things, the phone works pretty good for a 2 year old device, and I wouldn’t have an issue if I paid maybe 400-450 for this phone but when I’m paying Almost the same price as a brand new one, I expected higher quality or at least oem quality parts :(",2020年11月16日 在美国审核

Renewed phone looks brand-new.,"For a 2-year old phone, this was a pretty nice phone. The only scratches on it were very faint and you had to angle it under a light to really notice them. The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because I noticed that the ear speaker and the speakers on the bottom of the phone seemed to be a little dusty. Yes this is what happens when you buy a used phone and it didn't really bother me, but just thought I'd point it out. The last reason for the 4 stars was because the speakers on the bottom of the bottom seemed to be blown or partially blown. They just sounded pretty raspy and I compared it to a friends phone, which is the same exact phone, and it was very clear that this phone's speakers were a little blown. You really only noticed it when it was above half volume. To me this is something that should've been fixed. To most people though, it probably isn't super noticeable though.",2021年1月15日 在美国审核

Phone is damaged,"The phone I received did not match the product description on the page.The screen is damaged. The product description says the phone will be in ""excellent condition"" with no damage visible from 12"". The damage on the screen is visible from more than 12"". The gouge is very deep.I didn't turn the phone on before starting the return because the gouge in the front screen would be too aggravating for me to want to keep the phone anyway. It would be very distracting, and I wonder if it would impact the phone's ability to produce an image under the gouge.The phone arrived with a tempered glass screen protector on the screen, over the screen the damage. This felt a little underhanded to me.The glass back also looked to be a replacement non-OEM part. That wouldn't be a problem, necessarily, except it looks cheap and blocky.I initiated a return and will purchase another phone.",2022年6月19日 在美国审核

Would Recommend,Got mine in two days (Faster than I expected). Phone was in really good condition minus a couple tiny scuffs on the edge. Battery capacity was at 91% which is good considering they have a minimum of 80% to sell. Received mine through Verizon Pre-Owned. It also comes with a SIM tray remover if anyone was curious.

But while checking out this great like new iphone (according to Amazon) there is a one inch smear on the lower right corner which looked like a finger print, but it's deeper than the top glass there's seem to be some sort of mark underneath the screen which cannot be wiped away. Darn I thought I'd finally the perfect phone, I guess I have to return it. The vendor is Kiss Electronics don't know how they're involved in the distribution of these phones but the phone was delivered by fedex and the company also has a good rating they seem to be an OK store, but I'm not going to pay $630 for a cell phone with a potential bad screen on it....

Worked fine for 5 months then the battery exploded.,"When I bought this phone I knew it would have some defects because it was ""restored"". The battery significantly decreased in max capacity over the last 5 months from 86% to 62% and I had an average screen time of 3 hours and 48 minutes a day. This morning a random Green Line appeared on my screen and I had no idea where it came from. Then just this afternoon whilst I was taking an nap after work I heard a loud pop and found that my phone had expanded several inches out of the OtterBox case. My battery was like a swollen ice pack BUT the touch screen still worked! So I called Apple support who told me to immediately hang up and shut off the phone as it was liable to explode, due to gases being released inside the lithium battery. So fair warning to any who purchase a restored phone. Chances are the battery isn't in great shape and you should probably at least get the battery replaced when you buy it. I had noticed my max charge decreasing and kept putting it off. Now me and my OtterBox case wish I had. ALSO IF YOU SEE A GREEN LINE ON YOUR SCREEN IT COULD BE YOUR BATTERY STARTING TO EXPAND WITH GAS AND PRESSING UP AGAINST THE SCREEN.",2022年6月24日 在美国审核

Oh and because of issues with delivery on this item and another at the same time I talked to Amazon about the condition and they didn't seem to care.----I incorrectly assumed that the ""like new"" premium renewed experience would lend itself to being purchased as a gift, I was wrong. The protective plastic was improperly applied and was crinkled and bubbled and looked like this was a return. The box was crushed and torn.In short, it didn't look, ""like new"".My fault in trusting Amazon.

Nothing that alters the function of the phone, and still great condition for being used, but slightly bothersome.-Battery health is 90%-The seller I bought from (BuySpry) was kind enough to include a screen protector. That being said it came installed slightly crooked. Again, not a big deal at all, just thought I would mention it.

"front facing speaker is nearly inaudible, cant use for actual phone calls","this is the 2nd iPhone XS Max that i have purchased and they both have more or less dead front facing speakers, you know, the speaker you put up to your ear to actually use the phone... that is what this is. a phone. and because of this you are always required to either use a headset or speaker phone which uses the bottom speaker, not the one on the front of the phone.how in the world are these being tested ?music doesn't play out if it either, not in any type of audible manor.so.. what should I, as the buyer do? pay Mac to repair it when the seller claims that these units are fully functional and yet it very clear all they are doing is rudimentary tests on them ?no, i will not pay to have it repaired, i paid over $500 for a fully working 3yr old phone...and that is exactly what i expect to have.this is the only iphone model i have ever had that has dead front facing speaker issues, and there is ALOT of articles about it online, and their attempts to fix it in the article are all b.s. nothing but kindergarten troubleshooting that have never resolved anyones issue.its no wonder there are so many of these as used on the market.Also the battery is only rated at 88% battery life, how is this acceptable?",2021年3月6日 在美国审核

Junk.,"I purchased a ""refurbished"" iPhone XS Max. Physically the phone was in almost perfect condition, internally was another story.Phone would reset every 30 seconds while powered on, not even giving me the chance to be able to set it up. Extremely slow and wouldn't charge. I couldn't even keep it powered on long enough to connect it to iTunes to do a full system restore(troubleshooting method)Overall, extremely disappointed. I've read other reviews and was surprised that so many others have came across a plethora of issues as well.Amazon, you need to remove your ""Amazon Refurbished"" backing from this seller. It's pretty obvious that they are peddling junk. Honestly, you should remove them from this platform all together.",2021年6月2日 在美国审核
Almost a good deal.,"I received my re-conditioned iPhone 10sMax in four days. My first impression was mixed but excited.There are three significant scratches on the sides of the phone that go through the color that weren’t noted in the description. This wouldn’t have stopped me from buying it but weren’t a welcome surprise when I opened it up.The next but more significant problem occurred two weeks later when I had been using the phone for a week after switching out my older model. The earpiece speaker is completely inoperable in stereo listening mode for music and faint for hearing calls make on the phone. I hadn’t noticed earlier as I usually use a connected headset to make calls. What’s very disappointing is the sellers response which amounted to: return it for a refund or we’ll pay $30 towards repairs.Let’s be clear, I understand it’s reconditioned so I didn’t complain to the seller about the scratches on the body, I do however think a disclosure of them is in order for a $700 used device. Additionally, I believe the term re-conditioned means working as new and tested for proper operation. Very dissatisfied with the response from the seller.",2020年1月26日 在美国审核

Disappointing - it feels like I was harmed by an old friend,"Purchasing a renewed cell phone involves 4 critical (and inseparable) buying decision components. Each component is as important as the hardware itself, and all 4 components make-up the Buyer’s final buying decision and subsequent purchase experience:1) The Hardware2) The Warranty and Related Seller Assurances3) The Customer Service (pre &amp; post purchase)4) Overall value of the purchaseUnlike a new, factory-fresh telephone; a renewed telephone has a greater risk of failure, long-term usability issues and cosmetic imperfections. The obvious reason for this is a phone’s unknown history of use, maintenance/care, and ultimate reconditioning processes.The following will describe, in as much objective detail as is possible, my recent purchase of an iPhone XS Max from the Amazon Renewed Premium program. I will briefly describe myself, as an Amazon Buyer, to add helpful contextBUYERTo date, I have made 697 purchases with Amazon across 3 accounts in the US, Mexico and UK. My return ratio is 2.3%. Purchases mainly include high-end electronics (computers, phones, printers, networking gear, headphones, etc.) and unique household items. I am a Prime member who maintains and gifts book related subscriptions, and regularly gift Amazon Echo devices to family members. In short, our household(s) use Amazon frequently and Amazon has become “a family friend” that we have learned to rely on.1 - Hardwarehttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BFMH5GZ?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details . iPhone XS Max – The Apple flagship of late 2018The packaging was a 9”x 5” x2” white Amazon box with the phone and a charging cable. The white box was placed in 12’ x 10’ x 5” with 3 small bubbles. The white box “rattled around” in the outer packaging.The exterior of the phone was clean and scratch-free. The screen was protected with a sheet of soft plastic.Battery Health = 88%. Unlocked = Fully. iOS received = 14. iOS updated to 15.5.The configuration of the phone was a “quirky” and the screen flickered from time-to-time. Because of this, I called Apple Support (I have an account) to help evaluate the phone and assist with the configuration and pairing to my existing Apple accounts. The TSR connected with the iPhone XS Max and diagnosed that there were issues with the display module and (possibly) the antenna. The inability of the phone to recognize most nearby Bluetooth devices was thought to be the caused by the antenna issue. The Apple TSR suggested I return the phone. At this point, I had the phone for approximately 6 hours.Disappointed (I needed the phone and had already purchased another $65 of accessories), I agreed with the Apple TSR and she helped me annotate the precise reasons for her diagnosis. My next step was to contact Amazon, for the promised Premium Support, to describe the issues.2 - Warranty and Related Seller AssurancesI contacted the main Amazon Prime number and described the issues (At this point, I was in possession of the phone for less than 20 hours). I was transferred to another department that handled Amazon Renewed Premium matters.Rep 1 – after describing the issues to the Rep and the Apple diagnosis, the Rep agreed with the Apple TSR and suggested I return the phone. I opted to have the purchase price refunded to me (to have some time to consider my next purchase options and availability). The Amazon Renewed Premium Rep told me it could take up to 180 days for a refund! I asked to speak with a Supervisor.Supervisor – agreed the phone should be returned and stated that the return policy allowed up to 180 days but said that 25 days after they received the unit was more normal. She also stated that I had to pay for the shipping from Mexico back to the US (which has not been not normal for amazon.com returns from Mexico since 2015). Is this a new “standard return policy”? Why was it not clearly described on the website, they knew where it was going?I paid extra for the Amazon Renewed Premium phone and the assurances that I would be fully satisfied. When I made the purchase, that assurance gave me a “warm fuzzy feeling” and the confidence to complete the purchase of the phone.3 - Customer Service (pre &amp; post purchase)Pre-Purchase: Went smoothly. I read all of the materials, decided on the higher costs Amazon Renewed Premium version and paid for it. The order was placed on 11 May and it was received at my home in Cuernavaca, Mexico on 15 May. I paid USD 525.70 ($429.00 – phone, $8.24 – shipping &amp; handling and $88.46 for the import fees deposit). Please note the cost of shipping.Post-Purchase: Not a good experience. Details can be provided, upon request. To make a long story short, the refund and return process was an unexpected shock. The hardware/phone is defective and I promptly reported it. There was no reason for the sub-par treatment of the return. I offered to pay for the return but asked Amazon to arrange it through their low-cost contract rates – they refused. My cost for the return (via DHL) would be USD 95.35 and a 3-hour round trip drive to the nearest DHL office. Since 2015, I have not been asked to pay for the return of a defective device. Even DHL (the contract RMA carrier for Amazon) was surprised that I had to pay, and they handle Amazon returns every day.4 – Overall Value of the iPhone PurchaseI securely packed the iPhone XS Max to assure it would arrive safely, and sent it via DHL at a cost of USD 95.35. That now brings the cost of this phone to $621.05.Despite the claims that Amazon will reimburse me for shipping, I have been told by an Amazon Prime Rep that I can expect to be reimbursed no more than $20 for the return. If true, I will take at least a $73.35 loss on this purchase.I will not purchase another phone until I have received the full refund for this one. That means I will be without a phone for up to 180 days.Buying a renewed phone has not been the experience I was hoping for. The hardware was defective and the warranty/assurances/services I believed I was getting when buying from Amazon Renewed Premium did not materialize.Summary Rating1 Star – Hardware (iPhone XS Max) – defective1 Star – Warranty and Relate Seller Assurances1 Star – Customer Service1 Star – Overall ValueAgain, when buying a renewed product, it is impossible to detach the actual product (hardware) from the other components of the purchase. It is simply the nature of selling and buying renewed products.",2022年5月23日 在美国审核

I then called customer support, and he was talking crap. I am amazed how he ended working for amazon. I have been without my phone for 2 weeks. I got the same phone and that was defective too, i had to return that. for the same phone they have been sending me craps. Man, you shouldnot worry about money. TIME is what matters most.

It is basically buying an used phone without looking at it first,I bought the renewed one because I think new iPhone is way overpriced. I bought it last year but forgot to submit the review. My purchase was a bit of disappointment. It didn’t come with genuine Apple charger. Phone shows scratch marks all around bezel. Luckily screen is OK because there is a screen protector. But the protector was put on slanted so it is an eye sore itself. But this was not seller's fault I suppose. So far the phone itself functions OK and hopefully it will last a while.,2019年11月27日 在美国审核

Scammed,Ordered the phone and it worked like brand new. I was so happy. Within the first week it crashed on me and it would not turn on. I did a special reset on it but the phone kept crashing over and over again. I went to return it through UPS so I could get a replacement. I even let the seller know I returned the original. They told me it was up to Amazon to send out the replacement. The replacement never came and now Amazon is saying it was all up to the seller to send it and Amazon told me that the seller didn’t know if I had returned the original even though I sent the seller a screenshot of my UPS receipt detailing my original phone’s return. Somehow the seller cancelled my replacement phone and didn’t tell me anything about it but they were happy to take my $421 except I have nothing to show for it. This is insane.,2022年5月7日 在美国审核
A little sketchy,"The iPhone I got 100% does not possess a genuine Apple screen. The colors don’t look right, the bezel around the screen is noticeable bigger than genuine screens I have compared it to and to top it off the screen isn’t even installed correctly. When I push on the bottom left corner of the screen it makes an audible snapping sound and you can physically feel it move deeper into the phone. Force touch barely works if you could even say it works at all. The battery life is horrific, it is currently 1:25 pm my time, I took the phone off the charger at 7:00 am and the phone is on 40% with light usage. The only reason I am not sending this phone back is because I cannot afford to be without a phone. I would not trust buying a phone from an Amazon dealer again.",2021年9月9日 在美国审核

Works great but screen installed incorrectly resulting in crack writhing one week,"This item is as described correctly in many ways, the battery, facial recognition and other features work as new. Unfortunately with my purchase it seemed that it was not the original screen, this is not a problem except the replacement screen appears to be installed incorrectly causing it to stick out further than it normally would. There is a small gap that you could put your fingernail in and ant certain angles you can see the phone light on the inside. This is not what I would expect even if the phone is refurbished the installation should still be done properly. The screen is secure but it is not level, causing one side to stick out further than the other even if it is just millimeters, the reason I bring this up is because even with a case there is already a very small crack in the screen right on the end(where the screen sticks out the most). I am not sure if this problem is standard or just the item that I received but a crack in the screen in less than a week of owning it is a problem when I haven not dropped or mistreated the device at all. The other features work great but because of the screen I can not recommend this product.",2020年12月8日 在美国审核

The phone I was sold was blacklisted back in 2019.,"Thought this renewed phone would be perfect for my preteen daughter. I check it out when it arrived, and everything seemed to be in working condition. I bought it in November, to give to her for Christmas. Long story short… due to me having to be out of town a lot for work, I didn’t get service hooked up to it until February. After activating it, it was suspended by my carrier. When I called to find out what the issue was, I found out the phone was reported stolen and blacklisted back in 2019. And since I’m past the 90 days (by a week or two), I’m out over $400.

Damaged Speakers on phone. Distortion sound even when phone is asleep,"Can not believe that they sent out a damaged device out to me knowing how much money I spent on it. Everything seemed to be okay until I went to play something to check speakers on phone, it started making this awful distortion sound. Over and over everytime I tried to play anything...even when typing on the keyboard the awful sound kept coming up.There was no way of lowering the volume on the phone so it wouldn't be as loud, and even when I would push the side button to put the phone on sleep mode/closing all apps, the sound was still there. I am so disappointed with this purchase, and can't believe they are stating on description that it's in great working conditions. I contacted the company and they asked if I wanted a refund or a replacement, I went ahead and told them to send a replacement to give them another try. It's been about a week now and I have not received anything or heard anything either. I emailed them and they gave me a very board answer that it's in transit...not sure if it's the damaged one I sent them or the replacement they are sending me. Will keep you guys posted.",2020年4月15日 在美国审核

Better than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge,"Ok here is my review of my new iPhone XS Max.It replaces a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.<br>Battery:The battery isexcellent and here’s why.Obviously the antenna in the Samsung was awful because I would use 30% of the battery traveling from Central Massachusetts to western Mass, a 50 mile trip but there would be spots where it couldn’t find a tower and the battery usage skyrocketed when that happened.This is not a problem with the iPhone, so the antenna must be way better, or whatever technology it is that’s different from Samsung, it’s better.I could never get through a day without needing to recharge the Galaxy.I use the phone a lot for listening to music (battery drain), Google searches, Instagram and Twitter.With the iPhone my usage has not changed if anything has increased due to the novelty of the new phone yet I have been able to get through every day (except the day of purchase when it was not fully charged out of the box) without charging the battery during the day.The iPhone, also doesn’t burn a hole in my pants pocket or heat other objects when it’s battery consumption is high.Antenna: Continuing on the antenna subject, I work in a Home Depot and the Samsung had issues getting reception and wifi in the store.No such issue with the XS Max.I also don’t lose reception where I did traveling on the road to western Mass.Music and speakers: The speakers in the iPhone are head and shoulders above the Galaxy and sound much more professional or like they are bigger.The sound is rich and full bodied and I don’t mind listening to music on the phone.Copying music to the phone took (6) minutes as opposed to an hour compared to the Galaxy when I had to do that when the Galaxy was new.That’s over 3000 songs if anyone is counting.The music interface is iTunes which was a learning curve but a quick one.I liked the music player I had in the Galaxy better but I’m still learning iTunes.Music also sounds better on my car stereo coming out of the iPhone than it did from the Galaxy.I had noticed this when my son would play a song I had on my phone using his iPhone in my car, the quality was significantly better coming from his phone which I thought was strange, but the same phenomenon exists with my new iPhone and my car.Siri: Where have you been all my life?Siri's functionality is far superior to the Galaxy’s S Voice.I don’t have to touch my iPhone to send texts, play music etc. I just have to tell Siri to do it, even if the phone is locked.This is a huge advantage over the Galaxy S Voice which is supposed to do the same thing but I could never get it to work consistently or even at all.Facial Recognition versus Finger Print Scanner: The iPhone facial recognition wins again.The only app I have needing finger print recognition is my bank app, but I am still able to use it by typing the password in.All other apps I have use facial recognition, Amazon, Starbucks, and other apps needing credit card authorization.There are more facial recognition apps than finger print scanner ones.Facial Recognition works even in really low light like darkness.Speed.The iPhone is Faster period.My Starbucks app took 30 seconds to load on my Galaxy, on the iPhone it takes 5 seconds; that’s significantly faster especially when you’re in line at the drive thru!!!Maybe that’s not a fair comparison but it’s reality.Screen Resolution: Here theGalaxy has the win, hands down.The iPhone is close but it just can’t compete with the Galaxy screen colors and resolution.It’s not a big enough of a difference maker considering all of the iPhone wins so far.That and the iPhone XS Max screen is actually larger edge to edge than the Galaxy.Camera:I don’t take many photos with the phone but what I have taken I do notice the Galaxy was better in the photo quality area.Jury still out on this one.Keyboard or keyboard apps: Galaxy wins here.At least until I find a swipe able keyboard I like as much as the one I had on the Galaxy.Look and Feel:iPhone wins over Galaxy S7 Edge because I grew tired of the edge screen causing issues.Such as touching the edge just a little, and it was hard to know you were touching it, would make the screen appear unresponsive.Even though the iPhone has an edge to edge screen it does not suffer from this behavior probably due to the way it fits in my hand.I am just glad I don’t have to hit the screen 7 times before I get a response.Size and weight: the XS Max is the same size as the Galaxy S7 Edge and weighs about the same, I know not scientific but their weight is similar.TieHeadphonejack: None on iPhone and who cares really?What you don’t own a pair of Bluetooth headphones already?But you’re spending how much on this phone???Right, if you think the Headphone jack is a selling point you’re in the dark ages.As you can tell I like the iPhone a lot.Can’t believe I waited this long to switch.There was a time when I loved the Galaxybut that was when I first bought it.</br>",2018年12月4日 在美国审核
THIS ISNT A SCAM!,"I was super skeptical at first, I thought I was going to have to return it. But this phone came in 2 days, at about noon. This phone is literally. brand. new. (sort of) I know it’s refurbished but you could absolutely not tell that this phone has ever been used. Brand new quality, came in an actual apple box with an actual apple charger (no headphones but whatever) and for this price this is great. I saved over 100$ I was going to drop on a new one. I’m very very impressed.",2019年6月28日 在美国审核
An excellent renewed Iphone !,"I waited 9 months to evaluate this Iphone. I had my nephew who is a senior student at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Engineering to inspect it and he found that the physical status of the Iphone can be compared to a brand new one. The functionality is flawless. The item comes with a 20 point inspection by an Amazon Tech who checks it for wifi connectivity, cameras, accelometer, etc whic is dated and signed by the technician. The battery health is 90% and all previous data was removed. I recommend an Amazon Prime renewed Iphone without reservaton.",2022年2月16日 在美国审核

Reliable!,"I was hesitant to buy a refurbished/renewed phone from Amazon but I am glad that I did. I had recently bought myself an iPhone 11 but switched to an XS Max because it felt nicer in my hand (my friend has one) and was a lot cheaper. It arrived a week earlier, and it came in a Verizon pre-owned box! Knowing that it came from Verizon eased the doubts I had about purchasing the phone, but when it came I felt much better. The box (the part you plug into the wall) was from Apple and possibly the cord as well. From what I understand, there are different sellers so review each of them &amp; read the comments :) The battery life was 91% and everything worked!",2020年12月29日 在美国审核

Pleasantly surprised,"I got this phone as a gift from my best friend and I love it! I’ve had it about a week now so I wanted to make a review. Some of the reviews had me worried I’d get a bad phone but I didn’t. The battery is at 89% capacity but that’s fine everything else is perfect. It has the original oled screen (I tested it) and I looked all over the phone no scratches, no nothing it’s like new.",2020年12月25日 在美国审核

Not worth it!,"I have had this phone for almost a year, and for the past couple of months, (I would say about 4 months) my phone keeps freezing on random apps, glitching, and restarting by itself. I’m starting to question if this is an authentic iPhone as it didn’t come in its original packaging. Either way I would say spend a couple of more 100 dollars and buy yourself a real iPhone from Apple, because it’s not worth it in the long run. I’m requesting a refund right now, so we’ll see.",2020年6月10日 在美国审核

Was great for about a year…,"This phone worked for about a year, then the main board crashed. The Apple store said it was trash. For over $600, I expected the phone to last at least 2 years, hopefully more. I’m sure it has something to do with it being refurbished, but I guess we will never know. Other iPhones in our home last 4-5 years or more.",2021年8月22日 在美国审核
Dont buy from synergy,"Ordered from synergy and got the phone in a decent amount of time. When I got the phone and turned it on it was all good until I started typing my info using the keypad. The keys were not working correctly. I had to type in my wifi password and email. I couldn't do so because the t key was stuck or was working. I kept pressing it and holding down on the t key and it just wouldn't work. And when pressing on other keys it would activate keys that I had touched. For instance, I touched the r key and it would activate the keys around it. And the swipe-up action and slide action on the iPhone was not very responsive. It's as if they fixed the phone and then decided not to test it and just ship it. I don't understand why these companies, specifically the ones that sell refurbished phones cant test the phone (which takes like 2 minutes) to see if it works before shipping it and wasting not only my time but their time also. It's just embarrassing and shouldnt be occurring in 2021. If it was the early 2000s it would be understandable but its not.",2021年9月22日 在美国审核

Bought this refurb...,"Seems like new, no hidden dirt visible, no scratches or scuffs. Really a very good deal.<br>I specifically chose this one to avoid 5G capability. I just don't want that radiation near me. 4G is good enough and hopefully will last as long as I will. Upgrading from a 6+, this has some differences to get accustomed to, but nothing too bad. Face recognition is interesting if a double edge sword. Miss the fingerprint home button and would prefer that. I like the cover switch to turn off the screen, but it took me awhileto find where to shut off the power when I wish to. Yeah, I'm old school enough to recall land lines without answering machines even, so not too hung up on being accessible 24/7/365 like so many younger folk. I do appreciate limiting contact tracing, it's nobody's business where I am.The camera is very nice, has some new features I appreciate, has me contemplating selling my Nikons even.Well, if you want to not have 5G rammed into your life (do your own research if you wonder why someone might feel that way), you might also consider this phone as an alternative.Oh yeah, the larger screen suits older eyes...!</br>",2021年3月10日 在美国审核

Horribly Damaged,"When I received my phone, I already could see how damaged I received it...1. There was too much dust in the speaker area.2. After I recharged and called, I found out how horrible the sound was. We had the volume fully on the highest limit, however, we couldn't hear anyone. Distance wasn't the issue either. It sounded very cave-like and leave that apart, it was so hard to hear and comprehend.

Great price  and very satisfied with the quality.,"I bought two of these and they were in perfect condition.I was very leery of purchasing used phones due to the mixed reviews. I also didn’t want to jump right on here and leave a positive review without testing them for a little while. We’ve now had the phones for about a month and zero issues.Both phones were cosmetically perfect, and looked brand new. One phone had 100% battery health and the other was 94% which is pretty good.All features and functions work perfectly on both devices.I would definitely purchase again and recommend this seller.",2020年2月1日 在美国审核
Excellent deal,It really is like new. Battery health at 95%. No scratch. Came with glass screen protector perfectly installed. No issue with front and back camera. Face recognition very fast. It is a Sept 2018 model so 1.5 year old. Plenty more to go.,2020年6月5日 在美国审核

It doesn't come with the original box or headphones, but that's ok, they included charging cable and the brick.Sure its nice to have the newest generation iPhone, but the iPhone XS Max is still a beast and should hold its own comparing with iPhone 11, 11 pro or 12, 12 pro.

HOWEVER!The phone hardware and functions looked legit.. BUT.. the gold chrome edges were totally fake.. the buttons were fake feeling and really smooth (compared to the same phone my friend got from Apple and another one from BestBuy, those phones buttons felt sharper, the refurbished one felt really polished and smooth, so not the same as a the legit ones) ALSO my phone silent/vibration button was sunken into the edges level, original edges has that button a little bit up level of the volume buttons.. that was the main fake detail I noticed..And the little stripes at the sides kinda up and down idk how to describe them felt like a gap.. original phones is all smooth.I think I just got that special phone.. maybe was an original phone and just got the chrome edges replaced at the refurbishment process.. maybe if you buy a phone you’ll get everything legit.. but wasn’t my case so I decided to return it.",2020年8月14日 在美国审核

"Pretty good, very satisfied","So, I can’t share pictures of the phone itself and the physique because I forgot to snap pics once I got it, but if I could I would! I had a little bump with getting it on time due to issues with FedEx. The company was a little rude when I tried explaining, but eh I can overlook that because if the satisfaction so far with the product! Y’all in the details you’re promised AT LEAST 80% battery life.. I was expecting around that, but when I looked I’ve actually got 100% battery life!! This phone basically new! The physique isNo scratches, or ANY sign of wear! It was fully unlocked, and had no problems connecting it with my current provider. It does not have a SIM Card but they’re not very expensive at a store. Probably around $10 if that. I’m overall pretty satisfied! I had a 6s Plus for over a year, so pretty happy with this upgrade. It also came with an actual Apple charger which I also wasn’t expecting. I do wish they would include some headphones, but it’s all good. I’ll tune back in a couple of months to update how it’s been since! Every thing about it works awesome!***fast forward to March of 2012: I still like the phone, although I’m starting to think the battery life was changed before they sold it. It does rather fast on me, and takes forever to charge. My 6s would last at least another 30 mins on 1%! This one starts to lag as soon as it hits 2% and once it’s at 1% is dies. So I’m pretty bummed about that cause sometimes you don’t have your charger on hand to connect right away. I play CoD sometimes with my siblings and my battery goes down sooooo fast with it. I can maybe play 4 rounds before I get the low battery warning. My only issue I suppose I’ve had is the battery life. Other than that the phone still works pretty good. ♀**fast forward one year later**It’s pretty decent phone. I’m a heavy user so it’s gone down from 100% battery life to 90%. Batteries are replaceable at any Apple Store though for $50. I found the issue with the charging situation was the charger they sent. I don’t believe it was an actual apple charger, but either way this phone requires one of the newer charging boxes. I purchased one, and it charges in less than an hour. I haven’t really had much problems with it, and I’m still pretty satisfied with it. I would like to upgrade to an iPhone 11 though simply because I’m bored of this one ",2020年10月24日 在美国审核
like brand new,"I was honestly shocked when I received my refurbished phone because not only was it in a resealed apple box for the phone but I also received a brand new apple charger and cable as well. there is virtually no damage that I could find at all on the phone. the only thing I could find to show it was even refurbished was a little goo on the side of the screen where the screen had been replaced but it easily came off and looks perfect. the battery life is wonderful, the camera is amazing. both my Bluetooth and wifi work wonderfully. I'm beyond overjoyed at how wonderful the phone is and how cheap I got it compared to a brand new one. I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a refurbished phone.

"First experience with iPhone:  a very mixed bag, mostly positive","The renewed iPhone XS Max I purchased recently has been mostly a great performer with a few ""gotchas,"" mostly related to my inexperience with IOS but there are a couple of things you may want to be aware of generally:1.)""Renewed"" vs ""Renewed Premium.""Originally I was looking at a ""renewed premium"" version of the iPhone XS Max with 256GB internal storage; the price was almost $60 more for the premium renewed version.The biggest difference I could see outside of the longer warranty was that the premium phone was ""guaranteed"" to have 90% or more of maximum battery capacity available while the mere ""renewed"" phone was guaranteed to have 80% or more.I chose to save $60 and roll the dice; it paid off:93% maximum capacity remaining.Nice.2.)Condition of the phone on arrival.I have to admit, I was a little concerned when I opened the outer shipping box and saw that the box containing the phone had minimal bubble protection around it and was actually loose in the shipping box.However the phone box was solidly constructed and held the device securely in place.It was not an original Apple box so I didn't get the cool ""outer atmosphere of Jupiter"" phone image on the outside, nor was there an original Apple charger or earbuds included inside.Not to worry; there was a USB-C to lightning cable and a 30 watt fast charging adapter included (I'll take that over earbuds any day).The gold-color phone itself was packaged in shrink-wrap front and back and, for all intents and purposes, looked like a brand new phone.As a long-time Android user who'd never owned anything above a mid-range smartphone, the XS Max is the second most impressive phone I've ever held in my hand.The glass front and back with stainless steel frame makes quite the quality statement.I saw no noticeable flaws or scratches on the phone, but I did cover it in a protective case and added a screen protector right away so I could've missed something very miniscule.3.)Phone performance.Fast!Apps load quickly; scrolling, swiping, switching between apps, pages, screens seemed a bit smoother than my most recent Android device (Samsung Galaxy A71 5G). Did a Geekbench 5 performance test; needless to say, the A12 Bionic SOC blew away the Samsung's Qualcomm 765G chipset without breaking a sweat.But honestly when it came to actually putting the phone through the usual tasks, there wasn't much noticeable difference between the Apple and the Android machines.While the iPhone boasts a higher-resolution OLED display than the Samsung's Super AMOLED display, I still found myself preferring the Samsung's screen because of the extra .2"" of screen area, an advantage made even more noticeable because of the iPhone's more rounded edges and at times annoying screen notch.4.)Differences between IOS and Android.Keep this in mind:I am a long-time Android user and this is my very first experience with an iPhone.Have to ask, though:how do you long-time iPhone users live without the ability to close all your apps with a single tap, close all your (Safari) browser tabs in the same way or live without a ""restart"" button plus having to press two buttons to turn your phone off?I'm adjusting but my heart goes out to all of you who've been long deprived of those little conveniences.If Apple made those tiny changes and cut the price of the iPhone 12 Mini in half, they'd own the smartphone space.It's here that I have to acknowledge the one huge advantage iPhones have over Android phones:long-term OS updates.Eight-year old Android phones do not get Android 12; they're stuck with 4.4.4 or 5.1 if memory serves me right.A dear friend who has owned an iPhone 6S Plus she purchased new when it was first released (recently replaced with an iPhone 11) updated that phone to IOS 14.6 just before she purchased her new one.Advantage Apple in a big way.So far, I have to say I'm very happy with this iPhone and, by extension, the seller and their description of the phone; both have exceeded my expectations.If this XS Max holds up, I don't see me buying another phone for at least five years or more.And despite my affinity for Samsung phones and the Android OS, that next phone will probably be an iPhone.",2021年8月12日 在美国审核

I'm thrilled!,"Zero issues, totally love this phone. It's an upgrade for me. It works flawlessly and is even easier to use than a prior version. The bigger screen is nice. The edge to edge is nice. The camera, I LOVE the features! Some old ones are back, with huge improvements. That's a *big* deal for me. Charging time is fine. It did take me a little bit to get adjusted to the no home button, and a few other minor things. The chip size gives me the freedom to save whatever I need. The clarity of the screen is excellent. The phone is slim and lightweight. I like the feel of this phone, the size, and if you need it bulked up, you can get a heavier case for it. I picked a case that isn't that heavy. Now all I need to do is add an extra glass protector to keep the screen safe. I'm so, so, SO happy with this phone!",2021年2月7日 在美国审核

Worth the $500!,"My mom bought this phone to upgrade from her iPhone XR. She was interested in a larger phone at the time, and she was so pleased once it arrived in the mail. The only con I will mention is that the shipping notifications were completely off. Amazon showed that the phone wasn't to be delivered for a week or a little longer, but she received the phone in a couple of days. With this, the money wasn't taken out of her account until almost a week of her having the phone. It was very frustrating, and Amazon wasn't aware of this issue either. We had to call Amazon to inform this of this issue and even then, it took them another couple of days to withdraw the money from her account. But overall, the phone works exceptionally well and it was $500 well spent!",2021年5月27日 在美国审核

Extremely disappointed.,"So I’ve had this phone since March. When I first got it, it did not turn on at all and I thought that the battery must’ve have been dead so I charged it for a few minutes and it surprisingly turned on. Loved it since I got it/ everything worked except one thing. It randomly turns on and off, whenever I set the phone down and try to turn it back on it takes from 5 minutes up to a few days for it to turn back on. It is now May and this phone is completely useless, if I set it down for even a second it will turn off and not turn back on until days later. I’m guessing amazon did not fully refurbish this phone because it clearly has a hardware problem which is the turning off randomly without being prompted and I have filed for a return. I do not recommend buying from this seller.",2021年4月20日 在美国审核

Excelente producto,"Yo al igual que ustedes tenia mis dudas sobre si comprar un celular IPhone (renewed o también llamado renovado) y la verdad es que fue la mejor compra que hice. Quería un IPhone para la escuela y para jugar, y esta opción fue la mejor que hice, ya que su procesador hace que todo te vaya fluido, no vas a tener ninguna traba con ningun juego actual, el celular me llego con una estética de 9.9 ya que tenía un ligero pero muy ligero raspón en una de las esquinas pero para verlo tienes que tener una lupa, es imperceptible a simple vista, vino con una caja y un cargador muy genérico. Lo que yo recomiendo es que ya tengas un cargador turbo de IPhone con su respectivo cable para que no tengas ningún problema, y no incluye audífonos, prácricamente estás pagando lo del dispositivo. Me llegó con 92% de pila que es perfecto y todo viene al 100, no tengo ninguna falla, la batería le dura prácricamente todo el día de uso intenso.Ventaja: Pagas por el dispositivo y te va a salir muy bienDesventaja: Tienes que comprar cargador, cable y audífono a parte para tener una experiencia completaPD: Yo lo compré en unos 10 - 11 mil pesos mexicanos, si lo alcanzas a comprar a ese precio es muy recomendado ya que de unos 14 para arriba mejor opta por un iphone 11 o incluso 12",2021年4月14日 在墨西哥审核

Se Calienta DEMASIADO :(,"El teléfono se calienta en EXCESO, lo noté desde el primer día, sin embargo creí que era normal hasta cierto punto por las configuraciones iniciales y transferencia de datos de mi otro IPhone y así, así que le di el beneficio de la duda 3 días más para probarlo, pero ya no me empezó a gustar cuando abría algún juego (que ni siquiera comenzaba a jugarlo) y subía la temperatura de la parte trasera MUCHSIMO en específico alrededor de la cámara, a tal grado que si lo ponía en la piel quemaba.<br>Otras ocasiones al encenderlo y sin hacer nada más también subía rápidamente la temperatura, lo probé checando el sistema y a cada rato aparece que la temperatura es GRAVE, entonces lo tengo que dejar enfriar(al ponerlo en el piso que está frío y ya baja a temperatura normal, pero tengo que estar haciendo esto a cada rato y eso que en estos tiempos ya llueve y hace algo de frío, me pregunto que pasará en tiempo de calor???.Ya tuve una mala experiencia aos atrás con un IPhone 5S que se calentaba de la misma manera y al mes se daó la tarjeta madre y ya no tuvo remedio y por los $10,200 que me costó éste no estoy dispuesto a pasar por lo mismo, ahorita estoy en proceso de devolución y esperando respuesta de AMAZON y el vendedor ""BEST 11"" en cuanto se concrete el segumiento/devolución actualizaré mi resea, a continuación dejo puntos a favor y en contra del equipo, ya que en general no es malo, el detalle es que se calienta en exceso y eso no deja de ser una falla que si hubieran revisado y calado bien el teléfono no tuvieron ni porque haberlo ofertado.Puntos a DESTACAR:- Llegó antes de lo esperado.- Llegó con una condición de batería al 93%.- Llegó con un cargador genérico de un XS bonito.- Estética de un 9 en general.Puntos en CONTRA:- Se calienta DEMASIADO.- Se cierran algunas aplicaciones de la nada (ésto al subir la temperatura del equipo).</br>",2021年10月2日 在墨西哥审核

Prácticamente es un juego de azar que te llegue bien o mal el equipo,"Un poco de mi experiencia con Amazon renewed.Hice la compra de un xs max de 64 Gb, estuve analizando varios vendedores en Amazon renewed y todos tenían buenos comentarios y malos comentarios, también en internet vienen varias reseas de compras de celulares en esta misma modalidad de renewed, algunos su experiencia fue muy buena y la de otros muy mala, es como si fuera al azar, en fin. Escribo esto un mes después de que adquirí el equipo y describiré lo malo y lo buenoEmpezando por lo malo: 1. El celular venía raspado de ambos cristales como se aprecia en las fotos, los cuales si se notan a un brazo de distancia, como si al dueo anterior se le hubiera caído en el asfalto sin funda protectora, así como los bordes del mismo, venían golpeados2. Trae ligeramente pantalla fantasma casi imperceptible pero si lo miras detalladamente se puede observar bien, con el modo oscuro no se nota3. La batería venía con 81% de vida (en eso estoy de acuerdo que Amazon menciona que llegan de 80% para arriba) sin embargo eso significa hacerle un cambio de batería en un futuro cercano.Ahora si los puntos buenos de mi compra:1. Llegó al día siguiente2. Viene con todas sus piezas originales, me tomé la molestia de usar una herramienta para escanear todo el hardware y viene como salió de fábrica3. A pesar de que la batería venía al 81% le dura poco más de 24 horas en un uso normal4. Funciona Face ID5. La pantalla es la original (nada mas ese detallito que mencioné anteriormente)6. Aparentemente nunca se ha abierto el equipo7. Las cámaras funcionan perfectamente8. La pantalla no venía estrellada (solo raspada)9. Si venía liberado de fábrica como lo mencionanSi bien en mi caso no me fue tan mal al adquirir este iPhone he visto unos comentarios que no son tan satisfactorios pero como digo es cuestión de suerte, supongoEstaré actualizando este comentario si algo más se llegará a presentar, les recuerdo que esto lo escribo con un mes usándolo",2022年6月20日 在墨西哥审核

I didn't return it because it does the day. A tech from apple told me they replace the battery under warranty (apple care) when the range his at 85-88%depend of the case.
