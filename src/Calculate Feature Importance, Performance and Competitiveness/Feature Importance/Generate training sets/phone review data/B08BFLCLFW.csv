"Honestly, it was worth it","I was very hesitant about buying an iPhone off of Amazon, but I did it and was not disappointed. It came with 100% battery life, so it basically was brand new. It came with a charger and cube (plug), but that's it. Sorry to disappoint those who into that airpod life.No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down. But what it lacks in that feature, the iPhone delivers in the portrait camera mode, I seriously am in love with the blur feature.Sincerely,A very satisfied Amazon customer",2019年6月22日 在美国审核
"Beautiful, lovely, practically brand new iPhone XS!","I absolutely love my new iPhone XS! It arrived on time and practically brand new. The battery health is at 95% so it’s practically a brand new battery in here. It’s a very beautiful looking phone and is very responsive especially with the face recognition. That works very well even in low light settings, or if you have sunglasses and a hat on. I was surprised at how accurate that was. The battery lasts all day easily and I’ve hardly had any issues with apps crashing or anything like that.The phone itself was flawless and came with a protective film over it. There’s no scratches or signs of wear or anything to be found on the phone which I thought was great especially since it is an Amazon renewed item!I would definitely recommend this for anybody that is looking to upgrade their phone. The one I got is fully unlocked to GSM and CDMA networks so you can use it for any cell phone provider as long as you have a SIM card which it does not come with. It does come with a SIM tool as well as a generic charger and short cable which I just have tucked away as spares.",2020年2月4日 在美国审核

NOT LEGIT IPHONE. CHEAP KNOCKOFF According to Apple Store,"To my dismay, my phone started getting VERY hot for no reason, then my screen started going out. I took it to Apple and they asked me ""Where did you get this fixed?"". I was confused. They said that BOTH the SCREEN and BATTERY were NOT APPLE, and instead were cheap replacement parts, and that they wouldn't service it. I'm not out $500 that I paid for a cheap knockoff. I suspected this might be the case because the screen was... bland, and the XS is supposed to have a magnificent ""OLED"" screen.This is 3.5 months after purchase.Pros: It did come with a nice screen protector on it. It also worked with my ATT sim card.I don't know if this is an Amazon wide problem, or if it's just this seller, but I feel like I've been scammed. All I know is I paid for something and got a cheap knockoff that died. I'm actually a law student and you can bet as soon as I pass the bar, I'm filing an ""implied warranty"" suit out of principal; look it up if you've ever been told something is ""out of warranty"" but feel like it was 'supposed' to last at least that long.",2020年7月16日 在美国审核

Love the iPhone XS,"My husband has a bad habit of dropping his phone. He’s broken so many androids. Finally got him the iPhone XS and a case. Has dropped it many times and it’s still kicking. Over 6 months and still holding up!<br>iPhones have a great reputation for being tough.My son has had androids for years. I would always get him the cheapest ones because he would constantly break them. Case or no case. I finally upgraded my iPhone 5S to an iPhone XS and passed my old one to him and it lasted for 2 years. iPhone 5S is no longer compatible with our cell company so I had to upgrade his phone. I got him an iPhone XS as well (wasn’t giving up mine).First day I got my iPhone XS, we went to the water park. I didn’t want to leave it in the car or on the side lines, so I tried being careful as I carried it with me in the pool (stupid, I know). It fell in and was at the 4 foot depth for about 30 seconds before I could pull it out. No case. Still works great!We all have the 256gb size and none of us have used more than 60gb yet. I’ve had mine for 3 1/2 years, my son has had his for almost 2 years and my husband has had his for 6 months.</br>",2021年6月7日 在美国审核

Overall Very Happy With My Purchase from buySPRY,"I was skeptical about this at first, but I’m glad I bought the phone in the end. I read a lot of reviews that said the phone didn’t work or had varying things wrong with it, but I think most people go into this expecting a new phone with no damage whatsoever to the outside. However, if you read the product description carefully, it’ll tell you everything you need to know. I got lucky because there are no scratches or dents anywhere on the phone I received, but even if there had been some, I don’t think I would care. You’re paying $400 for a flagship phone, so expecting some minimal cosmetic damage is not a bad idea.I love this phone. Face recognition works great, the screen is vibrant and I can see a stark contrast in the colors when compared to my old iPhone 7+. I was hoping to get a newer battery, but I only got 83%. However, I don’t have an issue with that, because worst case scenario, I get the battery replaced for $70 at the Apple store, and I’m still paying less for this phone than I would pay for a new Xs or other newer iPhone.Overall, I can really only speak for buySPRY, but I really recommend buying from them. It’s a great phone, and I plan on having it for a long time.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核
Battery not 100%,"I’m content with what I got, but I think it should be more obvious that Amazon’s definition of refurbished is not the same as Apple’s definition. This item came with a battery at 88% of max capacity. I asked the vendor about their policy toward batteries in refurbished iPhone and they stated anything greater than 80% of max capacity is within Amazon’s guidelines.I am content with that for an iPhone XS 256gb at the $567 price point. I see the 256 GB model is now up to $599 which makes the battery comprise just a bit harder to swallow.The XS is a huge upgrade from my 7 and my wife’s 8 Plus. It was worth the price.

They even provided the necessary tool to change sim-cards from phone to phone, which was useful.

After some sorting, though, I have no regrets whatsoever.The capability of this phone, despite it being one model year old, is striking (Many of its features are superior even to the current iPhone 11, including the OLED screen).The battery life has been better than expected for a renewed device, likely because it is only one model year old.I have larger hands, but I prefer the 5.8 inch size for one-handed use.If you are looking for a foray into the Apple ecosphere, this opportunity is hard to beat.",2020年1月2日 在美国审核

Amazing! Perfect condition!,"Screen is amazing. Had to have OLED.

I was really really happy it was in such great condition. 89% battery.I hate that I love apple so much now. I had a Mac as a kid and kinda forgot how beautiful their OS and build quality is. But damn the cult of Mac entry fee is intimidating. And tbh it doesn’t replace windows for everything. But I’m slowly but surely going to own the entire ecosystem. And felt like and iPhone 7 wasn’t going to cut it. I’m really grateful my bf let me buy this.

Great quality and price,"Really nice quality. If you’re looking for a basically new phone, but don’t need the latest and greatest model, don’t hesitate to get this as it’s well worth the price. The phone looks almost new upon arrival, there were only very small scuffs on the edge of the screen. They were too small for me to even consider them scratches. And once I put a screen protector on, I don’t even see them. Obviously, if you want an absolutely perfect phone, maybe this isn’t for you. The battery health was at 92% when it arrived; I’m upgrading from an iPhone 6, so both the battery life and phone overall are a huge upgrade. If you’re new to buying a phone on Amazon like I was, I can confirm that the fully unlocked version of this phone does work with a Verizon SIM (I was a bit worried about that, the whole CDMA vs GSM thing goes well over my head). Anyway, overall really happy with this purchase thus far, I’ll update this review if anything happens.",2021年5月30日 在美国审核

I was reinsured that it will work with Sprint CDMA network since is fully unlocked. When I received the phone, read included instructions there was a part in the bottom stating that this device is only compatible with GSM network for T MOBILE and ATT. Went step further and verified using devices sn# on network provider’s website and came back with the same massage stating this device is NOT compatible.Make the story short, it took a call to network provider customer service, explain the story that this is fully unlocked phone and pleading that it should work.

Buying Renewed--Totally Worth It!,"I bought this phone back in December of 2019 and intentionally waited a few months to write a review to see how the phone behaved over time.Before buying the renewed iPhone XS off of Amazon, I had only bought brand new apple products from the Apple store. I would have never considered using an alternative site, until Apple raised it's prices on Apple Care. I have needed repairs on most of my Apple Products due to dropping my devices. I have no hate for Apple, but charging $250 for Apple care on phones is just not an option for me.I took a leap of faith and bought this version from Amazon. My XS came in the mail a few days later than expected (originally giving me the ""oh-crap-I-just-got-scammed"" feeling). Besides a few smudges which came off with some rubbing alcohol and the world's tiniest scratch--keep in mind, the renewed iPhones on amazon have to look like new from an arm's length away-- this phone is perfect.I genuinely have 0 complaints. The phone's battery has been consistent, I charge it for about 2-3 hours every 24-36 hours if I'm using the phone heavily throughout the day, and every 48 if not. It works flawlessly--it hasn't crashed, given me error messages, or refused to update (I've heard some horror stories about refurbished phones). Best of all, Amazon offers their own version of repair care for only $88.99 (comparable to Apple's old policy).Overall, if you're like me and you don't need the latest version of smartphones, but know you need an accident protection plan, then just get the Amazon renewed iPhones. It will save you hundreds of dollars and is absolutely worth it!",2020年4月5日 在美国审核

"Works Great, Good Value","Worked flawlessly after charging. I thought it would come with some battery life so I had a mini heart attack when it didn’t turn on but once charged everything worked great and I transitioned everything from my old phone with no problems. I upgraded from the X because I had a messed up screen and the battery life sucked. So far the battery life on the xs seems to be slightly better which is okay given that it’s basically the same exact model as the X internally. The only thing I’ve had come up is that the flashlight seems to be a slightly cooler tone and dimmer than before? It could be a trick of the mind, maybe I had a dirty flashlight before, or it has to do with it being refurbished but it just feels a little different than the one on the X I had. Not a big issue just something I noticed.

Good deal at this price.,"Reasonable delivery time:ordered on 1/4, delivered on 1/9.Phone received in excellent condition.No case scratches, scuffs, or dings.Screen had one very small, very light swirl scuff that isn’t noticeable unless held in a certain position with the device turned off.When device is on and screen is displaying the scuff is not visible.Should also note that the scuff totally disappeared when I placed the tempered glass screen protector on the unit.Most importantly, phone is fully functional.Phone received with an indicated battery life of 87% maximum capacity, which I find acceptable for a “refreshed” phone.Considering a “refurbished” unit from Apple’s site was considerably more than this unit’s cost, I think this phone was a good deal.Also, the fact that this purchase falls under the Amazon Renewed Guarantee (check it out) provided me with enough confidence to take a chance on buying a renewed product from Amazon.This phone was an upgrade for me from an iPhone 6, and after using the content transfer process to get the iPhone 6 content to the new phone, simply taking the micro-SIM chip out of the iPhone 6 and installing it in the iPhone XS completed upgrade process since I was staying with Verizon.This worked flawlessly and I was immediately using the new phone with the content exactly as it was on the old phone.Bottom line:This purchase of an Amazon Renewed iPhone worked out well for me.I would consider going this route again for a phone and/or other items I might need.Also, I would purchase again from the CellCow vendor as they delivered the product as advertised.",2020年2月3日 在美国审核

The phone was exactly as listed, the only issue I had was the 87% battery capacity and the ear piece speaker. But once I gave the phone a good clean with alcohol and cotton swabs, it was legit LOUDER than my 2 year old 11 pro max.

Other than that the phone was 256 GB, and the color matched, it even came with a free screen protector, but unfortunately I never use cases or screen protectors. But I could see that as an advantage because the screen did have a handful of scratches. But it’s not a dealbreaker. Ever had to give the phone he waiting I’ll give it is solid 7/10.

Absolutely Flawless,"Arrived a day early and in flawless condition. It even had tempered glass screen protector on it. Battery condition is 100%, all features work as new, you wouldn't be able to look at this phone vs. a new phone from the factory and tell a difference.

"Great Battery Life, Brilliant Display, Great Camera","I bought this phone mainly for work. The battery lasts throughout the workday while I'm making calls, browsing the web, and managing social media accounts.I upgraded from an iPhone 7+ and the XS has a larger screen, but the phone itself is smaller and easier to use with one hand. After getting used to the lack of a home button, I've also noticed that I can do the same operations faster than before.The camera quality is great, especially in portrait mode. It really accentuates the details, and the built-in editor makes it easy to quickly edit and post photos.The video quality is also great for a phone. It's more than capable of shooting short films in 4k or 1080p (although it would help to have accessories).Finally, I love the seamless integration of Apple products. I can easily work on a project by going back and forth between my MacBook Pro and iPhone, and when I'm on the go and don't feel like taking my phone everywhere, I can simply wear my apple watch and keep up with notifications and stay in touch with friends and family.",2020年5月21日 在美国审核
PERFECT! Just like new!!,"I was a little leery of buying a used iPhone off Amazon however I am so glad that I did! My XS arrived just as described, and looks brand new. It took me a little while to set up (user error) - and now it is working great. I simploy popped the SIM card out of my 8 and put into my new phone. I had looked at an iPhone 11 as well however when comparing the 11 and XS features, the two are almost identical other than the 11 being more expensive. I was able to get 256G for the same price I would 64g had I bought elsewhere. I wish prime shipping had been available but product did arrive when expected.

According to the box, the battery capacity was 90%, but when I opened the phone it was only 88%.

A Great Value on a Used Phone in Excellent Condition,"I admit I was a bit anxious about buying a used cellphone because there are so many ways for it to turn out bad, but I am happy to say my fears were not realized. In fact the phone arrived earlier than Amazon predicted and the condition of the phone was better than promised. There are no marks or scratches on the device except for a couple of very faint scratches on the front screen that I can only see in bright lighting, at the right angle and from very close range. At arms length it looks brand new, and with a glass screen protector installed I can't see those faint scratches at all. Everything works perfectly and the battery condition is 100% which is amazing for a used phone. It may be two years old but for just one third the price of new this iPhone XS is a great deal.",2021年3月2日 在美国审核
Overall happy but didn't match the discription,"Read this if your ear speaker is buzzingI doubt they are looking over these phones like they say they are. Got the XS and everything is working great but the ear speaker sounded blown out. When a speaker sounds like that usually it means you would need a replacement, but most of the time with the X and XS it's just lodged with dirt and needs to be cleaned out. (again the description says ""thoroughly cleaned"" and that they test and replace defective parts... doubt it.) I really didn't feel like going through a return process and since that was the only thing seemingly wrong I just loosened up the dirt with a soft brush and a q-tip and used scotch tape to grab up the loose dirt. My speaker now sounds normal and I didn't have to wait and risk getting another phone that had other issues.Other than that it works perfect. Battery was as described. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would probably go through them again in the future. I'll update if there are any other issues.",2020年6月9日 在美国审核

The camera is AMAZING quality it takes really good picture. the selfie camera is so good and the flash doesnt give that weird black and white fuzzy thing my old phone did when i used flash in the dark.

Best Experience with a Renewed Phone,"I’ve had pretty bad luck with finding Renewed phones as my iPhone 6 battery died as soon as I got it in 2018 and my iPhone 7s battery went down significantly after a battery change. So I was looking for a worth while upgrade and found this phone and took a chance. It was the best chance I got. The only con is the battery life at 88% but that was to be expected since I bought it refurbished, and the screen only has very light scratches that you can’t see when the screens on. Otherwise, this is definitely a steal and worth the money. Don’t be scared of refurbished phones, only buy from the trusted sellers like Amazon.

Not a scratch on it.,"New to Iphones, previous galaxy guy.Whole family was on Iphones but me.The voice recognition ability of Siri is truly amazing compared to whateverSamsung is using (Bixby?).I hate typing texts, and like to speak them, and some of my previous ones on the old phone were either hilarious or embarrassing or both.I think Siri learns heuristically because I rarely have to proof read what I speak now.Being able to just say, ""Hey Siri, call whoever"" and have it happen is a big time-saver not having to look up the numbers.It's like having an assistant in the phone, but not having to fool with setting it up.You just speak to it.The phone itself appears new, not a scratch on it.Battery life is at 86%, but I haven't been able to use it up in a day, so that works for me.Learning how to navigate the phone is challenging, as many things sort of work like a Galaxy, but it can be frustrating.But overall, I glad I made the switch.",2020年6月2日 在美国审核

Boy was I pleasantly surprised. This phone looked like it was brand new. I can't find a scratch anywhere, front or back! And the battery health was 94%.

Good Phone Better Deal.,Don’t use face recognition but sure it probably works fine. I was most impressed with the battery life. Easily get a day out of it. Only thing I notice is when talking the connection gets garbled and sounds robotic. I don’t believe that is the phone however as the only times that happened have been when I was speaking to someone either on an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 5s. Also they were moving so it could be a reception issue. Giving it 5 stars cause I can’t prove there are any issues whatsoever with the phone and the price is unbeatable.,2021年6月1日 在美国审核

"Lots of scratches on screen, hidden by screen protector","Summary: Screen has a lot of scratches on it, otherwise OK.Long version:This product arrived with a screen protector already on it. Underneath the screen protector were two large scratches, visible from arms length when the screen was off or dim. As someone who prefers dark mode, this was a bit annoying. The product description says no scratches are visible at arms length, but this is either false or they mean when the screen is on bright.The screen protector was of poor quality: it collected fuzz and hair on the edges where the adhesive was exposed. When I removed the screen protector, I found that underneath it were many very fine scratches in addition to the previously mentioned deeper scratches.It appears that the seller uses screen protectors to hide the scratches on the screen.The device was shipped in a thin aftermarket box in a plastic padded envelope. I would have preferred that a fragile, glass front and back, electronic device would be worth enough to ship in a box with more adequate packing materials.On the plus side, the battery health is 97%, and the rest of the frame is in immaculate condition. No dust in the ports or speaker grille. No visible damage to waterproofing ring.Total, I rate this a 3/5: it's half the price of Apple Certified refurbished, but the damage to the screen is impossible to ignore. Next time I will spend more from a more reputable seller. For the amount I paid I don't feel like I got a good deal, but I also don't feel like I got a super bad deal. My purchase was through Amazon from a seller called BuySPRY.",2020年5月1日 在美国审核

Perfect condition,I had to get in and write an initial review so that anyone considering this phone for a gift would feel confident with their purchase. Anytime you see “renewed” you expect something less than new but your not sure how it will compare to new. Honestly in this case you would not know the difference. I was pleasantly surprised. I received this phone yesterday and it is perfect as if I just unboxed a new iPhone XS. The phone powered on and had 100% battery. I am so please with this phone. It also arrived 4 days ahead of the expected delivery date. Thank you CellCow.,2019年12月6日 在美国审核

Cheaply fixed phones,"READ BEFORE BUYINF.<br>When you buy a product like this, I hope you know that this is NOT what you would usually get at an Apple store. These products are hit or miss. I ordered an iPhone 8 last year and it looked new and it’s lasted me until now. But I wanted to switch it up and treat myself and buy the iPhone XS. With prime, shipping was great and only took 2 days. When I opened it up, the box looked like it has been ran over by a car. When I opened the box up, the phone looked fine to the eye, but as soon as I played music, it sounded like the speakers were being covered with how muffled they were. And that was without a case. When talking about the front facing camera, I’m pretty sure my old iPhone 4 has a better one.And it’s another thing to mention: in the fine print, the battery life says “they sell phones as long as they are above 80% battery life”. Mine was on 85% when I received it. Yes I wish it was higher but know that before you buy it that you MAY need to go and get a new battery inside your phone if you need it to be at 100%.LISTEN!!!Amazon Refurbished can be a great thing. They have tons of great, awesome phones. But they also have phones that are VERY cheaply made. Just be wary of that before buying.I hope this helps y’all before you buy!!</br>",2020年7月11日 在美国审核

Could have been better.. not a Woot! Woot experience,"I have to preface the review by saying that I was skeptical when making this purchase because of the mixed reviews. But I did my due diligence on different sellers selling renewed devices andchose Woot as the seller. I had good experience with Woot when I directly purchased from them in the past.Amazon Renewed Guarantee provide additional reassurance if something did not go well. (but there's always a catch.. more on that at the end).Product Delivery/Packaging: Very poor1. The product was not eligible for prime for some reason.2. The delivery took more than week but was delivered as committed.3. The phone was packed in Bubble Envelope ...not an Iphone box or any box but just yellow bubble envelope.4. The phone was wrapped in foam cover and then bubble wrap (see picture). Was really surprised the phone survived the transit. Kudos to UPS who handled this with such carePhone and Accessories: Average1. Phone itself was wrapped up in plastic cover and looked almost good, with very lil signs of wear and tear2. Battery was at 86% capacity which again was very disappointing and am not sure how it will hold up over time. I will update this review after using the phone for a few days3. The accessories included were more of joke. Yes, technically there was a charger and a charging cable. I say technically since charger was not an OEM charger and the cable would not reach from outlet to the phone. It was barely 6 inches long. No thats not a typo but it was not even 6 inches.Just Phone: Good(This is not a review of an iPhone XS itself, but the renewed phone delivered)1.As mentioned above the physical condition of the phone was good. There were very few signs of wear and tear2. It was ATT Model A1920 (MT8X2LL/A), fully unlocked with both GSM/CDMA Support3. I was able to register my apple id and update it to latest firmware.4. FaceID works and that was reassuring5. Screen Quality did not look as impressive as i would have thought from OLED. Need to compare it more. Will update the review.6. However, the battery capacity was at 86% which was concerning since I am sure it will deplete to bare minimum or less than minimum pretty soon. I will update this review and return if things go south soonAmazon Renewed Guarantee: TBD1. I was not aware that there could potentially be a restocking fee if a product is returned. I came across this information thanks to a response from an amazon customer in the Q&amp; A section.2. Though on chat I was reassured by Amazon rep that Amazon would honor or help honor the guarantee within the warranty period.3. So I will update this if i even have to use amazon renewed guarantee. but still this is something to be aware of before making a renewed purchase.Overall, buying an expensive renewed phone can be a dicey affair. Wish there was much better or robust program around renewed phones.",2021年2月19日 在美国审核

Great phone at an amazing price,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I previously had an iPhone 7 and was looking for an affordable upgrade. I got this XS 256GB for $520 and feel like it was an amazing deal. Out of the box, the phone had 100% battery health, no scratches, dents or blemishes, and was fully functional. In my case, you would never know that it was a refurbished phone.As far as the phone itself, I grow to love it more and more everyday. The OLED screen is incredible, face recognition is excellent, the camera and videos are really amazing, wireless charging is a great feature, and the battery life is such an improvement from my previous phone, which had the battery replaced once before. As a plus, iOS 13 runs beautifully on this phone and I'm really enjoying the added features. I could easily see myself having this phone for years to come, provided I don't break or lose it...Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an upgrade but wants to save $200+ dollars on a new iPhone.PS I purchased my phone with Kiss Electronics. The phone arrived earlier than expected. Weird packaging, but like I said, in perfect condition (as far as I can tell).",2020年5月24日 在美国审核

Be Careful From Who You Buy!,"I just received my iPhone XS that I purchased from the provider 'Woot!', and the phone itself is amazing. Runs like a dream, has 94% remaining battery life, and only two small scuffs on the sides of the body.However, I wasn't a fan of the way they packaged it. They put it a paper mailer with the bubble wrap lining, and the phone + accessories were loose inside. The wall charger was a Lenovo plug, and the cable was a 3-inch AmazonBasics cord. DON'T PLAN ON USING WHAT THEY GIVE YOU! The phone was individually bubble-wrapped and wrapped in plastic, so while it was safe, I'd rather it be in its own box.Overall I'm very satisfied with what I get, but be prepared to spend up to $50+ on quality accessories because these are unusable. I'd recommend 'Woot!' over other providers because I paid for a good used phone, and that's what I got. Not much more. I see other reviews and their nightmare stories of torn up, unusable devices. I'll update this review if anything changes. Thanks for reading!",2021年4月17日 在美国审核

"90 days to try it, so buy it!","My experience so far has been excellent! I was so nervous to buy a used device but I did my research and felt very comfortable with Amazon’s generous 90 day return policy on these renewed phones and I took a chance on a seller that had lots of positive reviews.~Seller~ All Out Mobile and was shipped through Prime and arrived three days early!~Battery~Arrived with 97 percent battery health and holds a charge all day long with pretty aggressive use.~Apperance~Extremely minor scratches on the side that all my cases cover and are so small that I couldn’t get a clear photo of them. The screen is beautiful with no burned out pixels, front &amp; back glass have zero scratches.~Camera~Front &amp; back both work perfectly and the lenses are clear.~General Functionality~I switched my SIM card first thenI used the Bluetooth option to seamlessly change everything over from my old iPhone 6 to this XS. Each app works perfectly. The switchover from the thumbprint to Face ID was easy &amp; all of my passwords work (yay!) Upgrading from the 6 &amp; iOS 12, operating this feels so smooth and delightful.~Packaging~It came with plain white packaging, an apple branded charging cable and power brick, as well as a device to pop out the SIM card.Honestly, besides not having the satisfaction of opening a brand new product... this feels brand new and saving hundreds of dollars feels even better.I highly recommend trying this service. I will update my review if something changes but at this point, one week later, I’m thrilled!",2020年12月2日 在美国审核

Scam,"I received this phone and set it up relatively easy. The following morning I began to establish my logins for various things such as banks, and other services. I found it very suspicious that the phone began to act up. The screen became unresponsive, black and inoperable. What really concerned me is you could hear numbers being dialed, and other weird sounds. I processed the return following all instructions, my only option was to clear the phone via I cloud. Coincidentally the phone screen became active again shortly after. I was able to verify that the phone was no longer attached to my account and only a setup screen would pop up. My suspicious was further exasperated when the vendor contacted me asking me for my login info and then immediately turned around and said a refund would be processed minus the “restocking fee.” I paid just over $400 for the initial purchase, the “restocking fee” apparently is $375. The vendor has mad no other attempt to contact me or correct this error.",2021年3月22日 在美国审核
Acceptable condition iphone,"So basically you’re getting a refurbished iPhone with scratch free screen and back glass which is great, I was completely open to have a few minor scratches here and there and I was going to be ok with it, but I wasn’t okay with having all 4 edges of the phone full of Light to moderate scratches, battery health came as 95% which is not that bad, overall if you’re looking to buy a phone like this you would really have to think twice before making a purchase of you care about moderate scratches all around the phone, if you don’t, then this would be a perfect iPhone for you.

Wouldnt sync with old phone,"Bought this to finally upgrade from my beloved SE 1Gen , which I've bought multiple times because i like the platform. Because its being dropped from continuous support i decided to get an XS. The phone was in decent condition from seller [Woot}, it did have a small chip in the screen towards the top, but i didn't mind it. After charging both phones, I tried to sync them while next to each other, and it would fail after downloading the latest iOS update. This would continue and the phone would just reboot over and over. So i entered DFU mode and downloaded the update directly to the phone through itunes. Tried to sync, and still errored out. Tried to setup the phone without syncing, just barebones... still would error out and would stay in a continuous reboot loop. Tried to sync via icloud backup... error.

"Great Phone, needs better packaging and charger.","I had gotten this phone within 5 days and it came in almost perfect condition. The battery capacity was at 94% and it came already charged (50%). A few issues I have are that this product does NOT come with a wall outlet or a pair of headphones, nor does it come in the original apple box. The phone came in a small, white box that was wrapped in plastic. I would’ve liked better packaging but the phone wasn’t damaged at all so I can’t complain. However, the phone should have came wrapped in a plastic peel that you see most new phones have just to prevent any scratches on the screen seeing as though the phone is made of glass. The iPhone XS itself gathers fingerprints easily due to the fact that it’s glass so please invest in a case and a screen protector if that is something that bothers you. Other than these things, I do recommend this phone (try to get the 251gb version if you can). Also! If you have Metro PCS , you will probably have to pay a fee to transfer your service to your new phone (that’s if the older phone is already under this carrier). Even though this is compatible with wireless charging, I DO NOT recommend you use wireless charging as your main method of charging your device. You could wear down you’re battery faster that way.<br><br>Edit : it’s been over a year and we are still going strong! Though the battery capacity is at 80%</br></br>",2020年3月12日 在美国审核

Ok for the price.,"Amazon Renewed description is “works and looks like new”. I received it with a light scratch on the screen and battery life at 90%. Amazon may say that up to 80% is ok, but my current iPhone is at 87% battery life and can’t go without charging every 4-5 hours. So 80% is BS.I’ll keep the phone as it is a good value for the money and i need a phone. I can pay Apple to change the battery in a year, but honestly, I think I’ll tell my friends to get refurnished from Apple. It has a better warranty, new case and battery.

I can’t charge and have headphones in at the same time. Also, I accidentally take screenshots all the time when turning it off or voluming up because the buttons are directly across from each other.

Not bad except the battery was toast - then things got interesting….,"The phone was for my daughter as an upgrade to an aging iPhone 6S. All worked well - screen quality was nice, face recognition and all else seemed to work as it should, but it quickly became apparent that the battery life was not at all what it should be. Checking the Battery Health (under Settings&gt;Battery&gt;Battery Health&gt;Maximum Capacity), it was at 63%. I would think a strong battery would be rule #1 when you send out a “renewed” phone.After reaching out to the vendor, they agreed to replace it AFTER I sent the original one back to them. Two problems here - they seemed to expect me to pay to ship back their weak product and they expected my daughter to do without her new phone for what could easily have been 2-3 weeks. They did send me a shipping label after I asked for one but with a busy summer, the “without a phone” issue was going to be a problem, along with the fact that I didn’t know where we would be when they decided to send the new one to us.As an alternative, I thought that maybe I should just take it to the Apple store and pony up the $69 for a new battery rather than risk getting another phone a couple of weeks later with a battery that was at or below the 80% that Apple recommends as a minimum standard.After running the diagnostics, Apple said all was good except the battery. While replacing it, they broke the screen and then said something about calibration issues. Long story short, my $69 got me a new (or at worst an Apple refurbed) phone. But this was a particularly lucky set of circumstances - and it wouldn’t have been quite so good had my daughter not just backed up all of her vacation photos before we took the phone in to Apple.Basically, if you get a phone from this vendor, you might get one with a junky battery and you can either deal with weak-ish customer service and go through the hassle of swapping it out via mail or spend $69 for a new battery at Apple. Maybe the Apple store will break your phone and replace it for free too. \_(ツ)_/",2021年8月5日 在美国审核

Please be careful... speaker distorts over 50% volume And battery life is horrible,I was skeptical about ordering this phone after reading all the comments..

After receiving the product and started using it I realized that the battery was decreasing rapidly so I rushed and checked the battery life which showed 96% I then received an update from apple which kinda fixed the battery life problem I had to buy a battery case in order to use it for a full day .. my other fault was that I couldn’t increase the volume over 50% or else the speakers would start to distort which is horrible..

No ha sido reparado.El único defecto que presenta y que es casi imperceptible es un micro rayón en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla que para mi gusto personal no afecta en nada su estética ni su funcionamiento, es algo con lo que se puede vivir sin lamentarse.Otro punto en contra es que el cargador y el cable no son originales, pero son homologados y funcionan perfectamente.En conclusión, mi experiencia en esta compra ha sido satisfactoria.",2021年3月31日 在美国审核

The contrast is superb, the color is somewhat vivid, but not too much. The phone had a few scratches on the screen, but not very noticeable, other then that the phone was in like new condition. The only problem is that the battery life is at only 81%, I was hopping that it would be higher, but I can take videos at 1080p for about 3 to 4 hours, before recharging, which is ok for me.

Phone is great; Charger not so much,"Overall, I'm satisfied with my new phone. This is my first iPhone after being an Android user. Out of the box I was extremely happy that the screen and body of the phone were flawless. It works great, I love all of my iPhone features from Siri, facial recognition, and the ability to heart my text messages. I love the size of the XS compared to the clunky Galaxy i had before. It came with a charger and super long cable, which all seemed to be in new condition. It doesn't come with headphones, which I knew from the description and other reviews. After having it for about 2 weeks, I'm noticing the battery life could be better, but this may also be due to my usage and it's still better then my old phone. Tonight my xs died while I had it plugged in and charging. An hour later, I still couldn't get it to charge which scared me and made me think it was something wrong with the phone. I switched charging ports and finally started to see a charge. So don't put too much faith in The ""Ashley Audio and Accessories"" branded charger so as not to get stranded with a dead phone. Replace the charger with something more trustworthy. The return policy seems pretty good and gave me piece of mind that if it was a problem with the phone, I'd have options for returning it without too much lost.",2020年12月1日 在美国审核

I updated the software, hoping that would fix it, but to no avail. I will not pay more then I already have for the phone, so I am going to return it. Personally, if a phone says it is refurbished, that should mean all it's functions are in working order, has a good screen, and good battery life.

Literally in like NEW condition. Battery health is the trade off.,"Nearly perfect. When received it I looked this thing over with scrutiny and magnifying glass precision. There was NO indication that it could have been used by ANYBODY, ever. None. Essentially, a new phone. Set up was a snap and it went right on the off brand the charger included.

UPDATE I sent the phone back and received the one i ordered (both phones came a day early) the new phone is in just as good condition AND the speaker works lol siri works a little better but thats apples problem i think so im happy it was a bit annoying to have to return the phone i dont know how they didnt check the speaker quality but i bumped it to 4 stars but well see how the return goes hopefully they get the phone and refund me.

Average condition,"Phone came with dents, cracks and scratches along the edges of the screen, overall moderate condition but not worth the price paid honestly, maybe $600 max but that’s my opinion.

It's a decent phone literally made out of glass,"We bought my 14yo son this phone for his birthday. All his friends had iPhones and he wanted to get an iPhone so he could communicate better with them since Apple limits the way iPhones can communicate with Android phones. He's been happy with the camera and video abilities of the phone and the facial recognition is really good on it. The battery life on this phone is ok. Much better than his old S7 but won't hold a candle to my S10 5G. The biggest problem is the screen is brittle. I mean BRITTLE. He was having issues with the screen having image burn, which was annoying but apparently a common problem with iPhone XS. Well, we have the phone in an Otterbox with a temepred glass screen protector. We had the exact same setup on his old S7 that lasted two years without any real cracks. Two weeks he had this phone and he was just sitting beside me on the bed and it slipped and hit the floor, maybe 2ft or less. Boom, screen cracked. The tempered glass protector is fine, no damage to that, but the screen is broken pretty badly now. This must be the worlds cheapest glass on this thing. We knew going in to it that iPhone glass is not anywhere near as strong as the glass on Samsungs, but I didn't realize it was this bad.He is pretty unhappy with his phone right now and is saying he wished he just stuck with an Android.",2021年2月22日 在美国审核

AVOID the seller BUYSPRY!!,"Avoid the seller Buyspry! I bought a phone for my daughter and it wasn’t working right within weeks. I returned it and bought another one hoping it was a fluke because the seller came recommended. That one seemed better so I assumed we were good.Bought myself one from BuySpry and that one had problems. Returned it and bought a new iPhone SE 2020 instead.Now, months later, my daughter’s phone isn’t working right. There are various problems, the main being that the touchscreen is off, making texting difficult, trying to buy things or play games is difficult. Anything you use the iPhone for is incredibly frustrating.I reached out to the seller but it’s past the return window (May 2020) and they advised me to get it fixed at a local shop.Again, avoid the seller BuySpry. They’re reconditioned phones are terrible and it’s not worth the money.The XS itself, is only okay.

Can’t Beat Value,"I bought this phone back in May and using this as my very first iPhone has been amazing. I have the silver 64gb model and when it arrived it looked flawless (besides a couple of scuffs on the band but a case will make you forget) I was scared to buy a 2nd hand phone especially with an oled screen because of burn in but this phone came with none at all from what i can see. I got 84% battery health out of the box (wanted 90+ but hey everyone has a different experience) After almost 2 months it dropped to 83% which still isn’t bad since it’s a 2nd hand phone. Battery life is what you’d expect from an iPhone, but overall I love it and it serves me well. To anyone who’s skeptical and hesitant like i was before buying a 2nd hand phone, just buy it and save your money, it’s completely worth it. I literally bought a $1000 phone for under $400.

The battery life is currently at 89% after the first couple of months of ownership for comparison. The phone's outside was like new when received, however, internally I began to have startling issues pretty early on (unuseable three months after purchase). My phone began experiencing a reboot loop and after being unable to correct the issue through updating and restoring, I brought it to a local trusted shop that found a damaged wire connected to the face id that was causing the issue. I had it fixed for $40 but I lost two months of data since my last full backup. The technician believed that the damage was likely caused during the screen replacement as part of the refurbishment process. My face id no longer works due to this issue, but otherwise is great. Hopefully this is a rare complication and perhaps buying a warranty wouldn't have been a bad idea. Otherwise, I love the phone.",2021年1月30日 在美国审核

I worked with tech support initially but after a hour on the iPhone thinking the problem was corrected, problem resurfaced.The second XS worked normally for about a week but then the display would occasionally distort for a minute or so.For the potential savings it may be worth the possibility of getting a beautiful used phone.You do have 90 days to evaluate and the vendor is very good about handling returns.

BAD BATTERY and BAD SCREEN GLASS,"Bought this phone for a couple of weeks, still in the return period. This battery is so bad which can not even last for more than half day. Single movie would cost about 35% battery? Seriously?The screen glass is also too bad to use. I have no habit to use a screen protector, and I never put my phone with the key. I found the screen especially top half has some kind of wearing on the glass which I can feel with my finger touch. Due to this I can not read the words on that area of the screen clearly and smoothly. Feel the words very indistinct like having a shadow on the words. Some kind of gray pixels are also found, I did not know whether I saw gray pixels because of the wearing the glass and change the angle of the light.Face recognition is also very fair. If I hold the phone on the hand and set it apart like 1 ft then it can unlock pretty quick. if I wake up in the morning and hold it .5 ft to the eye then it can not unlock it anyway. Maybe I used it in the wrong way.Overall, the experience was bad, already returned for a refund. Never known a refurbished item could have a such bad screen feeling. Gonna purchase something else instead. Could be a pleasure if the seller returned funds real quick. :)",2020年4月20日 在美国审核

The battery life is at 87% which is disappointing because my old iPhone that I am selling is at 94% which means I’m switching out great battery life for much lower battery quality even the phone I bought is newer. The tempered glass screen protect is put in crookedly which is annoying because it’s not that hard to put them on. I have 90 days so I’ll see how it goes. It also makes me nervous that I don’t know exactly what was wrong with this phone before. I’d say the price for the quality of battery life is overpriced for a used refurbished phone. Also it came with those crappy chargers you’d buy at a gas station. Probably won’t be using it because I heard if you don’t use an original apple charger it can decline the life of your phone battery.",2020年2月21日 在美国审核

Nice phone but not in Excellent condition.,"The received phone was beautiful, in excellent physical shape with no blemishes.The battery level was at 82%, which was slightly disheartening to me, as I previously purchase an iphone 6s from Verizon Pre-owned with an excellent battery health.I was expecting something similar with this phone, but that wasn't the case.I did reach out to the vendor about my concerns, but I did not receive a response from them.After a couple of weeks, I noticed that the earpiece speaker was crackling when I played song files on the phone.This discovery unfortunately led me to request a replacement phone, but I was not aware that Verizon Pre-owned does not offer replacement items.So now I am waiting on a refund.",2021年4月17日 在美国审核

"Product was in good condition, but the battery was disappointing.","I ordered two iPhone XS models, and when I opened the package I found no defects, scratches or anything worrying (aside from some dust around the camera), I did some diagnostic testing on both phones and everything was genuine and working properly. I was able to sign in with my apple ID and the phones were unlocked as promised, I had no issues with any of the software and my phones updated to the latest IOS with no issues.HOWEVER my only issue was that one of the iPhone's I bought had a battery health of 77% rather than the promised 80%, The second iPhone had a health of 80% (I guess that's what I was promised on the description). If anyone is going to order from here I would be more concerned about your battery health rather than the condition of your phone, this may be different for each person but consistently the battery is the biggest complain I have heard from renewed and refurbished phones.",2022年4月21日 在美国审核
Sim card tray missing and sim port obstructed,"As the head line says, the tray that holds the sim card was missing. Which was disappointing to my daughter, who is turning 16 at the end of the month. This was presented as an early B-day gift, because her old one started giving out this week.Of course, I overlooked that the fact that the sim tray was missing and she discovered this after opening the gift.Anyway, rather than going through the return/figurative fist fight for a replacement or refund that would undoubtedly take a week or more to resolve; I decided to try and curb her disappointment by hitting a cellphone repair shop a few blocks away.The repairman was great! At first, we could not get the sim trays to fit. After attempting with several trays from various iPhone models that he had in his shop, he decided to open it and found the port was obstructed with a small piece of plastic. After that the tray fit fine and the repairman said nothing was owed, but I insisted and payed him something. If you're in the Niles, IL area his shop is at 7637 N. Milwaukee Ave, just outside the Chicago city limits.After finding out that there was a piece of plastic obstructing the port, I'm guessing someone at this resale shop decided just to ship it without the tray, because they could not get it to fit. Or, the shop is so disorganized that the phone was shipped by mistake. Either way, it was a pretty big mistake and I count myself lucky that I knew of a place that fixed it cheaply for me.Other than that, once the port was cleared the phone worked great and she is quite happy with it.",2021年6月4日 在美国审核

Phone Bricked Within Half a Year,"Phone was bought on April 27, 2020. Worked perfectly through out the months I had it, used it daily and never dropped it. October of 2020 I was using it for work at night and screen went black, flashed green and pink very quickly, then seemingly turned off by itself. Tried to boot it back up but was greeted by an endless loop of the Apple logo. Never got past it and when I emailed the company about the phone bricking, they said they couldn't handle the issue due to the warranty only being for NINETY DAYS. Not even for half a year did they have the warranty and not even a year which is baffling. My phone bricked after buying it for myself for my birthday within 6 months, and the company warranty couldn't even cover me. Learn from my mistake and don't buy this phone without at LEAST getting a year warranty on it from somewhere, or just better yet don't buy the phone at all.

Came with a aftermarket LCD screen,First off the few pros: The condition of the device itself was really good and came with solid battery health (94% on my unit)The main con and why I returned the device was the aftermarket LCD screen it had installed instead of OLED which the iPhone XS should have. The entire point of buying a XS is because you want that nicer screen otherwise I could have just got a XR instead. The LCD screen also has a slightly thicker bezel near the bottom. I will not buying phones again from Amazon Renewed as you just don’t know what you’re getting and the seller might have replaced the screen or replaced other parts without disclosing it. I’ve usually bought my phones and tablets through Swappa and never had a issue on there + you can actually see the device you are getting. I will be using them again instead.(In the photo on the left is the XS with the LCD screen and on the right is my 11 Pro with the original OLED screen.

Damaged Headset Speaker,"I ordered this item with Electronicity USA. Straight out of the box, it looked good. However, when I tried to activate the phone, there wasn't the necessary IMEI number in the settings.

The audio quality wasn't great, and I wasn't able to clean the debris out myself.I didn't take stars off for this, but I also received a phone that was well out of the general AppleCare warranty. This means the iPhone was sold by Apple over a year ago. This is obviously expected for a refurbished iPhone, but keep this in mind that in case you have a problem with your iPhone.EDIT: I was wrong about the missing IMEI number.

I contacted the seller asking about an exchange since ""they guarantee like new"" and seeing as it was only a few days past the 90 days i thought they wouldn't be like apple and take the phone back and give me another one, since they can fix the faulty one they sold me. Apparently though, that is their actual game. Make the phones good enough to last the 90 days and then they can wash their hands of it. I mean at least apple gives you a year, so that you can at least feel semi justified in re-buying their phone a year later.The fact that their refurbished phone broke legit less than 2 weeks post the delivery date is a HUGE red flag. if this was a case of a year or something I would get it, but less than two weeks?!? This is defiantly a we only make it good enough to last until we dont have to care but can still charge a boat load energy.I do not recommend buying this as you will have to buy another one in 3 months. might as well buy a brand new one since you'll end up spending close to $1000 in 6 months.

It also arrived with a maximum battery capacity of 85% which I was ok with, as well as a charging cube, cord, and a SIM card ejector tool. However, the phone came with a screen protector that hid many scratches. This included a scratch that ran the entire length of the screen. The scratches are noticeable at arm’s length with the screen off. Even though I didn’t see the severity of the scratches until I removed the screen protector to put on a different one, I felt that it was dishonest not to disclose the condition of the screen.",2021年3月5日 在美国审核

"scratched and the speaker dented, battery eh refund was easy","I was upgrading from a 6s plus. It arrived earlier than expected, and the front screen was great looking, however…. Both aluminum sides were completely top to bottom full of scratches, there was also scratches around the camera, and the speaker on the front had a dent in it. The battery was at 84% which is lower than my current iPhone 6s Plusso for over 350 dollars I really wasn’t that impressed, I know it’s refurbished, just not worth a couple hundred dollars to me? I returned it, they were really far with my refund so I will give them that! I was worried about losing my button but the facial recognition was honestly pretty quick every time. I just ordered the iPhone XR from a different seller, let’s hope it’s a better experience!",2021年5月20日 在美国审核

Reason NOT to purchase renewed items,"When you buy a renewed item you would expect it to at least have better battery life than almost worn. Apple says when the battery life gets to 80% or lower , it’s considered worn and should be changed. So I pay more than $300 for an iPhone XS and now I would have to pay Apple to change the battery. These items are supposed to be tested and checked. Apparently the one that checked mine was drunk or forgot their glasses that day and passed this one. If it sounds like I’m a little pissed then you would be right. First it was late being delivered and then I set it up only to find the battery life was close to being worn. My granddaughter loves the phone , only had a couple days and I’m wanting to send it back but she will be without a phone for who knows how long if I ask for a replacement. I’m really torn on what to do. Pay to have the battery changed or send it back and just buy one from a more reputable store. Don’t get me wrong , the phone is in beautiful condition.

Scratches all along the sides of the phone. The back of the phone has scratches &amp; cracks near the camera &amp; the screen has a black spot on it. The worst part is, they have made it difficult to send back. Often times they will have an option to have the post office print the shipping label but I have to print it so I had to go buy ink &amp; get my printer out to print the label to send it back. I absolutely hate dealing with returns so if they are minor/cosmetic issues, I'll try to just deal with it but this item looks like I was sent someones broken phone. I cant believe I spent $300 on this phone &amp; it's completely unusable. The battery life is non existent. It dies within a couple hours without use.

This is the WORST Amazon Purchase I have EVER made,"Listen, I know your reading other reviews before you buy this phone. Some reviews are saying they got a near MINT condition iphone, or a iphone that's in""not so bad"" condition.But then there are ones like the one I received. This screen had the most amount of scuffs, scratches, and cracks i've ever seen. It's so bad. Also, the battery was at a frightening low 85%. The phone was not even factory reset either!! In fact, the last person who used this even left their call history on here AND a picture. Are you serious? You actually got to be joking sending out a product like this given the listing description the seller is providing. This literally feels like someone else's return.Oh ALSO, I spent $15 EXTRA dollars for FASTER shipping.......and it ended up arriving 4 DAYS LATER than standard shipping would cost. ANDthe seller shipped this in a jiffy envelope. I repeat, the seller sent a iPhone in a JIFFY envelope. This is beyond unacceptable. And I have pictures to prove all of this. Its such a tight fit in this envelope that I can’t even get it back inside to send it back!So currently, I have reached out to the seller because I would like to receive a replacement iPhone XS Space Gray Unlocked in good condition like in the other positive reviews you see here as well as a refund on my shipping costs so we'll see what happens. However, if that does not work out I am returning, getting a full refund and never looking back.TLDR: The amount of stress this purchase has caused me is not worth the price in the slightest.

Slightly Problematic,"The phone worked fine for the most part.... kinda.<br>On the first day it already had glitches with the unlock screen &amp; momentary unresponsiveness with the touch screen. But compared to my last phone, I didn’t mind it much.Then one day, almost a month after purchasing, the lock screen just stopped working completely. Couldn’t unlock my phone at all. I figured, restart the phone it’s fine. And for a while, that seemed to work. Until after a few minutes of use, black lines just started appearing on my screen vertically. And glitches on the screen.So the phone was slightly damaged all throughout my usage, even tho I bought the best condition! But it still performed decently besides the occasional glitching.With refurbished iPhones, these things can happen &amp; you sometimes might get unfortunate. Some of them will neverfunction well, no matter how many times it’s repaired/renewed.Giving one star for leaving me off the grid for 2 weeks waiting for refund &amp; forcing me to deal with a subpar phone while I had it. Got a new one, same model and now ik what THIS phone SHOULD have been like. Pales in comparison, immensely!</br>",2021年6月9日 在美国审核

The screen developed a dead spot and the battery was getting below 80% which is when Apple recommends replacement.

Battery defective. Amazon refused to honor replacement arrangement.,"I received the phone within 2 days of ordering. The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement.

BROKE AFTER FIVE MONTHS (DID NOT DROP/BREAK) HARDWARE IS FAULTY!,"I had a cracked/broken phone (Yea, iPhone 6) for years that worked better than this phone. However, my boyfriend felt bad that my phone was older and cracked, so he bought me a refurbished one from this site on Amazon. I have other friends and family with this phone, and they were pleased with the product. I even had a family member buy a refurbished phone from another company (we should have used them!!!)I had hesitation about this phone from the beginning of my setup and thought about sending it back. But I finally got it set up and went on. It was nice to have an updated, non-cracked phone that I could take pictures with.However, a month ago, it started with the bottom portion glitching out and unable to type. So, I researched the problem and did the recommended troubleshooting. Unfortunately, it's only got worse, and now to send one text, I have to turn the phone off and on repeatedly. Otherwise, it will text normally then start adding letters randomly and quickly or it will jump to another page.If I open an app, it will start jumping around moving pages, letters jumping (playing Works with Friends), and many more hardware issues!!The phone was not dropped or broken. I use it very little compared to other phone users. I typically use the phone to play a word game, text, take pictures, check email (work), and social media (even though I've been on a 2-week detox from that part).It is very disheartening to purchase a $400 product only to have it five months later malfunction for NO obvious reason. I understand I was bought a refurbished phone, but you would expect it to last longer than five months!!Thanks for my $400 paperweight! I would not recommend buying from this company and definitely buy the year warranty when buying refurbished products.

Defective Device ,"I’m rather perturbed. You spend hundreds on something that is guaranteed to work as new.Sadly, mine was defective. Imagine my irritation when I noticed that a strip around half a centimeter wide, roughly where the “I” key is when the keyboard is fully expanded, is completely unresponsive! And worse, the device came to me overseas mere days before the return cutoff! So I have to toggle the keyboard and/or rotate the screen so I can access certain functions in apps or swipe away something that only runs in landscape mode! Waste of money!!",2020年10月7日 在美国审核

HIT OR MISS,"I am extremely disappointed with the product. 5 months after purchase and the display is not working. I have two friends who have bought their phones from here and they were happy with it. That is why i decided to also go here to buy a new phone. However, I regret not taking the negative reviews into consideration before buying a refurbished iPhone. First off I realized soon after receiving my iPhone XS that it would heat up pretty quickly and become pretty hot. It bugged me because I spent 670 dollars after tax and I felt that after spending that amount it should have worked optimally. I regret not returning right then and there, but I brushed it off because I felt that I was being to picky and it wouldn't be a big deal. A couple months in my screen randomly went completely white. I tried rebooting it and accidentally called 911 twice. I couldn't cancel the call because the screen wasn't showing. Anyways after sometime the screen went back to normal except a very small portion in the upper left corner where the battery percentage shows was completely black. It did not affect my usage since it was a small part of the screen so I just continued on with it like that. I was just happy the phone turned on. Fast forward to now the entire screen is black. I thought my phone had died so I put it on the charger to no avail. I can tell the phone is on. Hey Siri worked but the frickin screen is black. So take heed to this review if you are thinking about purchasing. I feel frustrated and unlucky that the phone I happened to get was so janky.",2021年1月3日 在美国审核

Easily the best deal ever for an iPhone,"Full disclosure.. I got mine from AT&amp;T but Amazon knows I have spent thousands with them.<br>A lot of initial noise about the screen not being OLED or HD but honestly the screen is just fine. Images are crisp. The battery life is quite decent and charges quickly. Face ID is really good. No home button but you really don't miss it. I am trading up to the iPhone 13 Pro using my XR as a trade-in. AT&amp;T shipped out the phone two days ago and it's arriving tomorrow.I feel like I am betraying a friend... This is how solid the XR really is. You can't really go wrong.. I just traded up because AT&amp;T was allowing for a great trade-in value. Since this is the only way I can keep buying up into the next generation, every two to three years I trade up again.This is a great phone. Everything about it is solid. You will be happy with it. Just do get a good screen protector and case. These phones will lose value if they get all dinged up... unless you are going to keep it for ever... but regardless... do you really want a dinged up phone?Also take care to check the battery health.. It is insettings. Quoting Apple ""Apple considers any iPhone with a battery capacity of 80% or above to be in optimal condition."" I have to say if I received a phone with a battery in the low 80s I would make a stink.. but that's just me.</br>",2021年11月11日 在美国审核

The phone constantly reboots itself every 2-3 minutes or so. Defective,"When I received the phone initially, there were few scruffles on the edges. No visible scratches on the screen or on back. So far so good. When I turned on the phone and started to set it up, after a few minutes it automatically rebooted. I didn't think much of it and went ahead to finish setting up, only for the phone to restart 5-6 times until set up was done. I finally set it up, bit frustrated, thought of looking at comments, where many initially had few problems until the suggest force-restart. I did that, and even now, every time I wanna use the phone, I have to either turn it on because it's already powered off or enter the passcode, as, ""iPhone requires a passcode after restart"".Now, within hours of holding this phone, I decided to finally return it as, 1) ""It restarted while I was on a video conference"", 2) ""When I was on phone calls"", 3) ""I was installing apps and it rebooted"".They mention that ""This product is not Apple certified, but has been professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers. The product may have minimal scratches or dents, and a battery with at least 80% capacity. Box may be generic and accessories may not be original, but will be compatible and fully functional.""So did you deliberately send me a defunct product?Boy, to worse it off, the return isn't free.

Screen and speaker problem,"Ok I got a space gray iPhone XS with 256GB and I was happy to get it, it came in a odd box but I didn’t really care about that I got the phone and there are dings and scratch’s on The outer metal case of the phone and I can tell that I he front glass and LCD scream were replaced be the screen kinda drags the image like on a old computer we’re the image stays for a second, that was one thing I wasannoyed about that but the second thing was that it sound like the bottom speaker was broken at one point and they bought another one but it is a really cheap speaker because at certain points it has a pitch of sound with it and it just doesn’t sound good the speaker next to the Face ID camera works perfectly just the one at the bottom of the phone is really bad me personally I don’t care if it has dings or scratch’s on the outer Metal frame of the phone it just really annoys me when they replace the speaker with a bad one and that they get a cheaper LCD screen just to save a little bit of money I mostly notice the bad cream when I’m scrolling on instagram, Twitter or YouTube it’s when you are scrolling that it is the most noticeable problem wouldn’t buy again if I new they replaced parts with bad ones also battery gets kinda worm/hot when charging or on FaceTime and sometimes just randomly but that may just happen when running powerful or changing so that may just be normal not to sure but the battery stays charged all day so not too worried about the battery",2019年12月15日 在美国审核
Logic Board Failed After 18 Months,"After an extremely frustrating experience in with Apple Support during the COVID crisis.I was told that the Power Up issue with my iPhone XS was a failed Logic Board (this took 7 days, several calls, chats).This phone was 18 months old and had no problems leading up to the ""failure"".Yesterday, Apple Support posted on my Repair webpage that it was not the battery and I had to replace my XS, I was not told the new diagnosis (it seemed very much like Support was instructed not the explain the diagnosis) just that the Phone must be replaced.I did not get the Logic Board failure explanation until I spoke/chatted with not less than 5 Apple Support people in at least 3 countries.I finally got a nice duo based in OK would were honest and frankly not rude (weird for Apple which in the past has always had polite Support people).While failed Logic board was the diagnosis, the way this was handled and the fact that Apple has stopped selling iPhone XS makes me believe that the Phone had bad Logic Boards from the beginning and Apple made a financial and marketing decision not to make this public and simply discontinue sales of the Phone rather than make it part of the Exchange and Repair Extension Programs.Since Apple has stopped selling the Phone XS, I feel obligated to let people know that I believe that the Logic Boards were faulty from the beginning and Apple's quality control may be failing.I elected not to purchase the replacement and I will use my old 7 until I have confidence that Apple is not selling inferior tech.",2020年4月8日 在美国审核

Simply unreliable,"I had iPhone XS and it was my first iPhone. For the first two months it worked fine. The problems started with iOS updates. The first update didn't install and some apps stopped working. After the support people fixed it, the phone started to shut down on its own. The next update turned the phone into a brick. When I tried to turn it on, it would display that ""Connect to iTunes"" picture. At the Apple store the technician magically revived the phone using a new update but the very next day the phone started to drop wifi connection. I think the phone had serious hardware problems but Apple engineers figured out how to partially overcome the problems through software tricks. This is how Apple avoids replacing a bad phone with a new one. I ended up paying for an upgrade.",2019年10月12日 在美国审核

"Update error ""4013"" renders almost flawless iphone unusable","Let me explain the one starI am an Apple iphone fan (or was)with my spouse and kids also owning different iPhone models. I have owned pretty much every model of iPhone since the very first one.This issue I am listing here has happened to me with 3 of the models I have owned, iphone 5s, iphone 6s and now to iphone xs (did not upgrade to 11 yet)The one-star rating does not reflect the performance or aesthetics which is all the best when it comes to iPhone.The part I am frustrated is the reliability which I am going to try and explain here.I hope someone in Apple pays attention to this, since I have seen several other posts in forums where other are complaining as well.In summary the iphone xs randomly failed to start up after an update and this is not the first model I am seeing this issue.I left the phone charged one night and the message indicated that update will be auto deployed.Woke up in the morning and I was unable to restart the phone. The start process ends up with the sign indicating asking the phone to be connected to itunes for restore. Connecting to itunes and trying to update or even worst case restore from backup will fail with error code “4013”Now I am into IT myself and am fairly handy with this process so as suggested by the instructions for “4013” error I have updated the itunes, updated the laptop computer, used a different and even new cable and tried this update process in all 6 laptop/desktop I have at my place.None of these solves the error.Called up Apple support and indicated this happened after an update process. The person walks you through all the steps which you have already done and indicates this will have to be shipped back to Apple and for a price of almost new phone they can repair it.The phone itself is little more than a year….. so out of Apple warranty and I don not have extended warranty. I paid the full price for this approx.. $1250 for the 256GB version which now sits as a piece of metal with no use. Even worst all data I had since last backup is lost.This is the third time over the years this issue happens where the iphone stops working after an update. All these phones look flawless with no issues and almost brand new, so I wonder why Apple pushes updates and takes no responsibility when they cause the phone to stop working.I was an ardent Apple fan to date and this has made me and family think twice before investing in future iphones.- Victor",2020年9月4日 在美国审核
Phone is great,"So the iPhone itself is great, vendor did a great job. 3 stars is for Apple. We bought this specifically to address connectivity issues my daughter had with her Dexcom CGM and iPhone 7+. Newer phone did nothing to resolve. Apple says ""we dunno, maybe reset the phone?"" and Dexcom says it doesn't know. Basically a BT clusterf@ck that no one wants to own. Not sure why an App gets approved (a medical device App!) that only works sometimes. Forums (Apple and Dexcom) yield about 40-50% success reports. Most have just given up.Sorry for the rant.Seller was great.",2020年10月29日 在美国审核

Absolute Trash,"It looks like the seller took a belt sander to the screen before they shipped it. Not only that, they hid it with a cheap screen protector too, as if I wouldn't pull it off the second I opened the package. I expected some minor scratches, but this is ridiculous. If you look closely, there are two decent sized chips in the screen too that distort the pixels behind it.They literally ship the lowest grade they possibly can. The minimum battery health they're allowed to ship is 80%. They gave me one at 81%. Do not buy refurbished from Amazon. Buy refurbished from Apple.My seller was ""Tech Exchangee"" (yes, with the poor spelling), so steer clear of them.",2021年5月29日 在美国审核
Not Excellent Condition,"The phone has a very visible scratch on the screen, despite being listed as ""like new, excellent condition."" I'm not as bothered by that as I am the faulty charging port. I didn't even realize it until a month after I got it, because I had been charging it wirelessly. But when I was in my car, I decided to plug it in and found that it will charge for a second and then the lightning cable just falls out of the port. I tried a bunch of different chargers and it's all the same. They all fit snugly in my old phone, so it's definitely this one that's the problem. I probably won't be buying Amazon renewed again. As a first time purchaser, this leaves a very bad impression.",2022年6月14日 在美国审核

I did return it ONLY because it was smaller than what I thought it would be. I wanted the same size as my 7plus. It was just a little smaller width wise than the 7plus. I almost hated to send it back because it came perfectly. Returning took a few days and I reached out to the seller and they responded so fast!

Ask what is checked or replaced,"iPhone came in excellent condition with battery max capacity at 86%, this is a 2 1/2 year old phone so Amazon does promise at least 80% battery life. One issue that I did come against was when I took this iPhone straight to the apple store to replace battery and in taking it to them it was discovered that a screw located internally was stripped. So replacing the battery wasn’t even an option. Amazon does guarantee that their products are throughly checked and inspected to look and run like new and that was a clear misconception. I’m still pleased with my phone. I do wish I could’ve gotten the battery replacement. Apple couldn’t proceed with replacing the battery only option was keeping or paying for replacement. Now with keeping this phone I wonder if i accidentally crack my screen will that screw give me issue later down the road with changing whatever is broken?",2021年11月17日 在美国审核

Extremely worn Battery,"To start off, the box it came in wasn’t anything special. It alone doesn’t effect my review, but it was pretty disappointing nonetheless. You get a charger and charging box with it, and no other accessories aside from the iPhone itself. I didn’t have any scruffs and to start off the phone was very impressive. I noticed my battery had gone down tremendously and that’s where the problem lies. I was on my phone for 1 hour and 30 minutes, (this is total time on the phone as I just opened it) where I spent time downloading and making personal changes. As going through things in settings, I came across battery life. My iPhone 6s Plus I had used for a year, (about 6 hours a day of use) has a current battery life of 93%. This supposedly new iPhone XS, has 88% battery life. This means it’s been used for well over a year by another user, and has run out of life. I think I’m lucky to have not received scratches because this was terrible. I would not have made the purchase if I saw this.

"Great Deal, nice phone!","Product arrived a day early which I was excited about.<br>I bought the XS Gold, 64GB, AT&amp;T unlocked. Absolutely no issues so far.Battery life at 100% which shocked me being a refurbished phoneNo scratches or scuffs on the sides or screen. Couldn’t believe that as well. (Will add better pictures soon of edges phone currently in case)Paid $375 shipped to my door in less than a week. (February 15, 2021)The Screen quality is a beautiful display with The OLED really showing the colors, and the response time from the operating system is incredible.Face Recognition compared to my girlfriend’s IPhone X is quicker but not by anything that would make a difference, however opening large apps I notice the XS is slightly faster.I’d say spend the extra $50-$75 in today’s market to buy the XS instead of the X. 4GB of ram instead of 3GB, Camera Stutter features, etc..I would recommend if you are hesitant to buy refurbished, do it. This is my 3rd refurbished phone and every single one from the 5GS, 6S, and now this XS have been as perfect as my family’s Plan-bought phones.Packaging was basic but effective!My only complaint so far is the charger brick and charger are pretty cheap, I’ll be buying a regular charger from Apple.Overall 10/10.

Bad Battery,The battery on arrival is 80% health. Meaning I can only charge my phone 80% of the way. This is sad even for a refurbished phone.

I know they said the product might have minimal scratches. But this is not minimal! I think it’s ridiculous. I didn’t come with protective plastic or anything either.

Physically, it is PERFECT, and I mean PERFECT, not 1 scratch or dent anywhere, it's as if I'm the first person to use it. No marks, no dirt, very clean and crisp, the front, back, sides, top and bottom.

Last update..,"I am transitioning backward from my stolen iphone pro 12 :’( to xs and will list out some pros and cons from the experience<br>Cons first:- it took a while to install all the apps when setting up. Probably about 1-2hours to complete setup of all the apps with a few reboots because the installation wasn’t initiating. it took less than 30 min for pro 12- my battery max capacity is at 84%. Maybe it could be put in the list of ‘pro’s but well, it does seem to drain faster than newer phones. For less than $400 I guess it could still be a steal- heats up pretty badly when charging but I’ve experienced this with newer phones as well..- bit of delay in typing, noticing as I’m typing this review I have to continuously retype a few characters and mistypes ‘a’ with a period? but it is really irritating every time I type ‘a’ I have to backspace and try few more times.- freezing apps - like uber/messaging apps when trying to make a callPros:- externally close to impeccable, even came with a screen protector!- I don’t experience tooo much slowness/delay using the phone other than sometimes freezing apps &lt;10x/day- I love the design of xs compared to 12 pro- screen quality is not so differentiable from my human eyes comparing to 12 pro- exchange/return period of 90 days-if I find ‘a’ keyboard issue uncompromisable I could return within 90 days for exchange. This is really a decent amount of time for at least to try out- supports esim!Anyway I am loving my phone so far except for a few things like keyboard issue (pretty major), battery capacity, and not supporting 5g as xs model.. we’ll see how this goes I might stillrequest for an exchange or refund if these issues really come to unbearable in the next few weeks..Unfortunately despite how much I wanted to love this beautiful phone, I have returned it and got a different refurbished phone (different generation). I still think it was a good to have tried out, as I’ve had issues with new iPhone xs phone that I got years back where it continuously heated up, auto rebooted until it ran out of battery, and had to get replaced as well. And now having had problems with multiple iphone xs’, it may be the problem with hardware when it got built. This xs phone I returned also had screen issues (ghost typing/not recognizing my typing) and continued to get worse and started to try self deleting my apps or liking/disliking posts/youtube videos, etc. but really great to have long return guarantee period. It was a beautiful phone…</br>",2021年9月3日 在美国审核

Horrible,Phone overheated multiple times to the point where it burned my hand. Phone repeatedly shut off by itself or completely froze. Phone became so hot that it shattered inside of its own case which was an otter box! Worst of all they will not send you a new phone until you sent this one back first. Not everyone has the money to just buy another phone on a wim. And for people who rely on their phone for gps or work- going without a phone is not an option. Horrible experience!,2021年1月12日 在美国审核

Best Amazon buy yet!,I was Leary buying a renewed phone but was more than pleasantly surprised. The phone arrived totally unblemished and was just what I was looking for and was the right price. Setting up the phone which was a Verizon locked phone took only 15-20 minutes. Everything from my iPhone 7 was transferred first. I then installed the SIM card removed from the 7 and basically it was up and running.All of my worst fears never came true at all. The phone was totally wonderful and was exactly what was ordered. Looks feels and acts like a brand new iPhone XS.,2019年12月1日 在美国审核

Overall a great purchase,"So I ordered the iPhone XS unlocked and overall I have no complaints about the phone itself. It is in great condition, has no scratches or marks, battery at 85%, and works well. My sim card was recognized and works (I have safelink wireless which is the Obama phone lol nad its through Tracfone which I think is through Tmobile) The only issue I have is that I can't create an Apple ID because it says too many IDs have been created on this phone. My apple ID is attached to an old phone number from years ago and it is gonna take 10-14 days to verify my new number since I no longer have access to that device or number. So I would suggest verifying a new number ahead of time if you have the same issue. I cant use the app store, facetime, iMessage, or anything so it sucks, but I will update my review once I get that all in order. All in all, I recommend this phone, great purchase and worth every penny!<br>**EDIT** so I realized I could create an Apple ID on my computer then sign in on my phone with it until my other ID verifies.I did, however, have issues with iMessage and FaceTime being verified.I spoke with apple and Apparently since this phone has had multiple numbers, they marked my phone number as spam. They were able to fix it in a single phone call. Hope this helps someone.</br>",2021年8月27日 在美国审核

Poor screen replacement done on phone.,The phone came looking really good besides around the camera the ring had some buffs also some dust and dirt in the openings. The battery capacity is 88% but it drains a little faster than id like even with low power mode especially considering the price. The screen isnt the original apple screen which I wouldn't mind as long as it was a decent replacement and maybe OLED? the connectors might have an issue because the screen glitches and blacks out while the phone is on. Also no sim tool provided and the sim tray was sorta stuck in the phone. Not terrible overall but im not thrilled considering the price.,2021年3月1日 在美国审核
"It almost like new, except the battery","This is my second time I tried renewed.The first one was iPad Pro that really, really like unused item.I don't expect that high when I buy this. As a phone it is hard to believe people don't actually use it and then sell it.Come out it is kind of what I expected. The phone itself is almost perfect, the screen, no scratch. If you don't check you will gonna believe it is an opened new phone. It comes with usb cable and iphone charger, both look like the original things.The only, really problem is the battery.I got my one at health 81%.Almost reached the unacceptable margin.There are somethings I can work around it. I upgrade from my dying 6s+ so even in 81% in this Xs, the battery is ""still last much longer"".Change battery is a regular running cost nowadays.So it this is not acceptable to you, stay away from renewed, especially for the stuff that people actually use, like phone.",2020年1月1日 在美国审核

I would definitely deal with these guys again minus the customer service issues.,2021年2月19日 在加拿大审核
Super recomendable.,"iPhone XS con estética 10/10, Batería 100% aun, todo funcional con las piezas originales, podría recomendar a""WirelessWarehouse USA"" que fue la empresa con la que lo adquirí.El celular viene con una caja genérica no muy estética pero lo que cuenta es el celular , un cargador y un cable certificados.Muy satisfecho con la compra.",2021年1月13日 在墨西哥审核
Satisfecho con el teléfono,"El teléfono llegó en perfecto estado, con un cargador, llave para la SIM y una tarjeta con un código QR para comunicarme con el comprador en caso de ser necesario. No tiene ninguna raya, ni en pantalla ni en el vidrio de atrás. La batería está al 84%, pero la duración de la carga es como si tuviera 90% (la batería de mi iPhone anterior duraba mucho menos estando en el mismo porcentaje). Sólo tiene un pequeo ""defecto"": a veces la pantalla no responde en el borde derecho, cuando quiero escribir la p o la , por ejemplo, pero no es un gran problema porque después de un rato funciona de nuevo (o puedo girar la pantalla). En definitiva, una gran compra.",2021年12月4日 在墨西哥审核
Producto reacondicionado que parece nuevo,"A ver, hay que leer bien la descripción, se trata de un producto reacondicionado que podría tener algunos detallitos. en mi caso cumplio al 100% lo que dice en la descripción y excedió mis expectativas. el teléfono se ve como nuevo, no trae ningun detalle y fuera de la capacidad de batería que no es nueva, no te darías cuenta de que se trata de un teléfono usado.Los accesorios genéricos funcionan de maravilla y viniendo del mundo iphone a estas alturas ya tengo muchos cables y cargadores.Así que el veredicto es 100 por 100 recomendable el ahorro contra uno nuevo fue más de un 30% y no siento ninguna diferencia",2021年4月12日 在墨西哥审核
It works as expected,"The package came early, the Iphone worked as it should. Although I was a little underwhelmed by the lack of contents on the inside. I thought I was scammed at first by the lack of design on the box and contents. It was just a blank box with a charging cable and the phone itself. Not quite the satisfying unboxing experience but my main focus was the iphone which worked great for me.",2021年7月15日 在加拿大审核

Great quality and no visible damage,"I was a doubtful at first and I did not want to purchase a refurbished product due to generally mixed reviews but I am very happy with this product and I’ve been using for about a month, it arrived on time and as soon as I opened it I checked for any visible damage or used marks. There are none at all.Got it from seller “Big Box LLC”It didn’t arrive with the original iPhone box as expected but it came with what seems to be its original cable and wall plug, which surprised me, I was expecting a generic accessory.The battery life quality is at 80% as expected and the phone was properly factory reset, there was no iCloud lock or anything.I already put a screen protector as seen in the picture and it runs smoothly.Great and noticeable generational jump from an iPhone 7, totally recommend it.",2022年6月22日 在加拿大审核

No se apaga, no tiene problemas de ningún tipo. Siento que hice una muy buena compra en cuanto al celular. Lo malo fue el cargador. Tuve que cambiarlo porque desde que se conectaba constantemente marcaba error de conexión.

Excelente compra a excelente precio.,"Hay muchas cosas por decir respecto al teléfono celular. Como a la mayoría de gente, el IPhone XS venía en una caja genérica junto a un cargador no original. Dejando eso de lado, el teléfono supero ampliamente mis expectativas. No todos los compradores tienen esta suerte, pero parece ser que al menos con esta empresa suelen ser más las buenas que las malas. El teléfono venía con 100% de capacidad de batería, sin ningún tipo de rayón, y básicamente en estado de nuevo. Las bocinas funcionan perfectamente, las cámaras también, y el rendimiento es como de teléfono recién salido de fábrica. Desbloqueado para usar con cualquier operador, y sin ningún problema de cuentas de apple o similares. Es cierto, comprarlo renovado no es para todos. Siempre se recomendará comprar el teléfono nuevo cuando la posibilidad existe, pero esta compra en definitiva ha sido de las mejores que he hecho cuando de un teléfono se trata. Hay motivos para arriesgarse a comprar acá. PD: Esta fue mi experiencia, no necesariamente será la de todas las compras de este tipo, pero a más común sea el dispositivo, más chance de que salga bien. El IPhone XS ha envejecido como buen vino.",2022年6月14日 在墨西哥审核

"Ganas mucho o pierdes mucho, tu decides","Compré dos negros de 256 GB, uno salió muy bien y otro salió malEl que salió bien no ha tenido ningún problema hasta ahora, incluso se cayó desde un buró de ropa y no hubo problemaEl otro celular parecía que tenía una batería defectuosa porque no duraba nada la carga, estuve a punto de devolverlo pero como la pantalla, bocinas, micrófono y de estética estaba como nuevo, decidí ver hasta cuando podría aguantar antes de que eso me volviera loco; y resultó que con sólo una calibración de batería fue suficiente para que tuviera una duración aceptable, PEEEERO después empezó a suceder la razón de que me metiera a subir esta resea, el celular se me apagó de la nada una vez (probablemente ya pasado el tiempo de devolución), y desde entonces, de vez en cuando se apaga solo, lo correcto sería decir que se crashea y se reinicia y es MUY molesto y frustrante (y todo por andar comprando más barato).Así que, yo recomiendo que mejor te compres uno nuevo o directamente desde Apple Refurbished y así no te preocupas de nada, sabes que no estarás siendo estafado ni de un lado ni del otroO si tienes buena suerte, arriesgate y cómprate uno de estos, como dije, uno de los que compré está como nuevo y sin ningún problema de momento(No subo fotos porque qué flojera xd)",2021年3月23日 在墨西哥审核

Battery health was at 84%. I would've liked it to be a bit higher, but it did have the minimum of 80% battery health. The phone came in a generic white box with a charging cord and wall plug. The phone also arrived earlier than expected.<br><br>Pros: Very good condition with minimal scratches. Arrived early.Cons: Barely reaching the 80% battery health minimum as advertised.

Relatively good.,"June 2022 update:The phone has stopped working entirely, it seems to be a hardware issue regarding the logic board. There were no noticeable issues leading up to its failure, and I wouldn’t say it’s gone through anything other than a short fall. I can’t remember the battery capacity, but I don’t think it needed servicing just yet. I’m disappointed that it didn’t even last for two years, though I can’t say this is reflective of all Renewed products. I would be hesitant to purchase again.August 2021 update:The battery percent is still 86%, there seems to be no burn-in. The OLED is highly enjoyable especially with black dark modes. The more recent OLED iPhones are much more expensive and the upgrade to an 11 is minor, so a pretty good deal!February 2021:The Renewed description is quite accurate, although and understandably, small scratches are still noticeable at arms length. Unfortunately, there is a small scratch on the camera lens with two very small cracks, though there are no problems with the camera. My iPhone XS has 86% battery capacity which is fine. Aside from the scratch, it looks and runs fine, I assume it’s the luck of the draw regarding any minor defects.Please pardon the screen protector and case in the photos, but there was really only one other small scratch aside from the one on the lens.",2021年2月20日 在加拿大审核

La pila no vino original y el touch se traba. Lo regresaré.,"La fecha de llegada y el embalaje BIEN pero el primer mensaje que salió cuando terminé de configurarlo fue que la batería no podía ser leída por no ser original. Al haber hecho investigación previa, sabía que es super común reemplazarlay que en general la batería se acaba rápido así que decidí quedarmelo y probarlo a pesar que la descripción dice: ""Este producto tendrá una batería que supere el 80 % de capacidad en comparación con uno nuevo"". En mi opinión la vida de la batería creo que es corta. Mi tiempo en pantalla es de 3-4h al día en redes sociales (poco cámara, cero juegos u otras apps) y al final del día se apaga.Su funcionamiento no es MALO, la cámara -que era de las razones principales por la que lo compré- funciona bien y por eso le di 3 estrellas, sin embargo a una semana de poco uso en general, me he dado cuenta que el touch se traba en casi todas las esquinas. Además de que me ha crasheado Whatsapp dos veces al mandar audios y me sale un mensaje diciendo que reinicie la app.El teléfono en general me gustó salvo por esos dos problemas que considero importantes y por lo tanto lo regresaré.",2022年6月25日 在墨西哥审核
