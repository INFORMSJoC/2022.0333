Great phone at a great price,"Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel's battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what's in the Pixel line, it's not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn't as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn't add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.",2020年10月3日 在美国审核

"Great phone, marred by some pretty big issues.","I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I've done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You'll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can't beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you've been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I'd say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn't, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it's not flagship levels by any stretch. You'll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you're looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I'd look elsewhere.From what I've seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There's undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I'm sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven't noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that's about all I've seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don't blame you.It really is a shame that I can't give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there's always the worry that time will make them worse. It's a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I'm more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I've dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It's been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it's starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it's opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here's the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone's screen. It's beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic ""angry Amazon customer 1-star"" review, but I'll refrain. There's still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here's my advice: don't bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It's still not the worst thing out there and I'm not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it's definitely the last Samsung product I'll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn't keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.",2020年11月18日 在美国审核
Bait &amp; Switch?,When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn't expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn't matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I'm still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn't rate 5/5.,2020年10月4日 在美国审核
This phone is AMAZING!!! Ignore bad reviews.,"To give some context, I'm coming from a Galaxy S7.FYI, I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I'm on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn't have to take the phone to store, I didn't have to log in and change settings, etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I'm gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It's also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing.3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung's OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I've been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I'm a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I'm looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21's for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary, if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT.",2021年1月12日 在美国审核

"Finally, a (quality) Samsung phone to compete with OnePlus. (Early review - Purchased @ TMobile)","I've been a OnePlus fan for years. I've owned a OnePlus 3, 6, and (currently) a 7t. They've always been solid phones at a solid price, undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.<br>So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I'm so happy with the 7t?Well, I have to confess. I'm getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.Then there's this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t, I've been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah, I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t's wide-angel lens isn't all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x, not 2x or even 3x.So if I wanted a better camera setup, why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras, but I'm not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it's 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it's 5x zoom? Nuts.$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?Now *that* was worth a look.I'm glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out, and this is still an early review (I've only had the phone for a couple of days), but so far I'm duly impressed.Now I won't belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8, not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.So what follows is a quick rundown of the good, the bad, and the meh. I don't think there's really anything ""ugly,"" just a little ""meh.""The Good...* I've never been a fan of the Samsung ""Edge"" style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice, flat, vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks, 6.5"" form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah, and it does 120hz, but for battery life purposes I've dialed mine back to 60hz. I'm not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I've seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn't squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865, but I don't have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser, password manager, camera, news feeds, social media, etc.)* The battery life has been good so far, and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it's app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing, a couple of Youtube videos, some social media, LOTS of messaging, a couple of calls.* &lt;drumroll&gt; The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It's a bona-fide wide-angle, too, unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle, producing nearly identical exposures and saturation, with plenty of detail. Sure, everyone's crazy about megapixels, but 12m is plenty for most applications and I've printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now, the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes, 8mp is a tad skimpy, but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms, 8mp 3x optical is... well, it's workable. So far the results are not only usable, but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable, though I wouldn't use them for blow-ups. At 20x, detail is dropping off fast, far earlier than the ""space"" zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well, they're unusable. At this price point, though, the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I'm paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups, so I'm getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don't do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.* Memory Card slot. Why can't Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn't Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!* Oh yeah, and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn't as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste, another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full. ""Passably."" This is no Bose Soundbar. It's just not annoying. ;)The Bad* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on, Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?* Plastic back. Some people don't like this. I'm fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you're spoiled by all-glass backs, this isn't going to win you over.* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher, tune it to your taste, and move on. OnePlus has a clean, crisp UI and that's the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.* 6gig of RAM? Come on, Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don't need 12gig, and I've never pushed my phone to those limits, but please, it's time to grow up and beef up the RAM, even at this price point.The Meh* 5G performance is good when you can find it, but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don't need 5G. I'm not streaming 8k to my phone. I'm just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.* Please, for the love of the UNIVERSE, kill BIXBY! Bixby, Bixby, Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa, it's utterly, completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties, the volume buttons should fall under the index finger, not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb, as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung, not so much.* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can't tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea, Samsung. (Correction, just take inspiration from it. :) )Bottom line...This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it's in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it's a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8.</br>",2020年10月4日 在美国审核
"Great value, totally worth it.","Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635 , the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I'm not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best, it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least, a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough, I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version, limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed, but who really needs that much power?), and of course keeping no apps running in the background, and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn't vibrate itself to oblivion, which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software, honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+, but I couldn't find anything that wasn't refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back, but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I'm happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware, because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone, the price, the value, and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger, the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.",2020年10月15日 在美国审核
"Why you should consider buying this phone, and what the reviewers fail to mention.","This is a fantastic phone.I bought this phone before it became available on Amazon at Best Buy, but I thought potential buyers would be interested in these attributes of the Samsung 21 FE.Positives (in no particular order):1) Excellent camera.It takes night pictures with a quality that is almost beyond belief.Yes, the night mode takes a little while to process, but it is quite worth it.I was able to capture an image that had stars visible in the image.I've never had that on a cell phone.The daytime images are comparable to the iPhone 13, which are quite good.Something the reviewers fail to mention with the camera is the Field of View, which is 79 degrees, or equivalent to around 26.5 mm, full frame, which is just a tad narrower than the iPhone 13, and quite a bit narrower than the s21 ultra which is around 24 mm, and the s22 ultra which is reported at coming in at 23 mm, with a FOV of 86 degrees.This is not acceptable as this will lead to significant distortion when taking pictures of people at closer range with the main camera.It may be possible to correct through algorithms using the AI, but the subjects will always be smaller. It seems there is a trend toward having much wider lenses on the main camera which doesn't really make sense considering there are ultra wide lenses on most of these phones. I fear this may be the last flagship grade Samsung to have a FOV as narrow as 79 degrees on the main lens with this level of quality.2) Thermal throttling.Yes, this is actually an advantage.The Snapdragon (SD) 888 was know to run hot, and the SD 8 Gen 1 is even hotter.Most people do not need that type of bleeding edge of performance. This phone actually runs quite cool. Most people don't want their phone to turn into a frying pan in order to squeak out an extra bit of performance, and if they do, then they will get a proper gaming phone like an Asus ROG.3) Battery life.I've seen conflicting reviews concerning battery life. Some reviewers see more that adequate battery life, while others find it lacking. Personally, I find battery life excellent with this phone.4) Aspect ratio and associated size. This phone has an aspect ration of 19.3:9. This is excellent news for those that find that phones have gotten too long and skinny making them difficult to be placed in a pocket or a purse.Not to mention, most content is still 16:9, which is more enjoyable to use on this aspect ratio.Very few reviewers will cover this.5) Excellent signal reception as per typical Qualcomm excellence with their radios.6) Many more updates available through Android 15 and a years worth of security updates beyond that.The S20 FE will only have till Android 13 and 1 year of security updates beyond this. This is increasingly important from a security perspective.This phone is not perfect, though, as indicated below:1) Weak haptic motor.Haptic motor is not very strong on this phone.2) People mention lack of glass back.I'm not sure how relevant this is as 90% of people buying this phone will put a case on it, myself included. I don't care about the plastic back on this phone. Looks fine to me.3) Price. This is a big one for a lot of people.Many compare it to the Pixel 6.Yeah, on paper that may work, but in the real world, the Pixel 6 is so buggy, it is difficult to use for many.In addition, the signal reception has been found to be lacking in the Pixel 6.A phone, no matter how well spec'd, is useless without a good signal.So, take the Pixel 6 out of your price comparison.That, being said, the price is still a little high, but there are many promotional offers on the phone now.4) Missing headphone jack and sd card slot.This is a disappointing thing for many, myself included, but the positive attributes outweigh this.",2022年1月19日 在美国审核
So close! But look elsewhere,"This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery, 120 hz, good cameras, recent cpu, and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn't something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums).

Love the Cloud Mint!,"I had my previous phone, a Huawei Mate 9for 3 years (ordered from Amazon), and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G, I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me, it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far, everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange, but I had to go with my favorite color, Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone, the bright light is a little blinding, especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life, it seems that it doesn't last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G, I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos, using social media, surfing the internet, etc.), I would have to charge it after a day, but with the Mate 9, I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn't allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen, which I'm bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone, charging adapter, charging cable, paperwork, and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones, but it's not a big deal. I'll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds, but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up, it came with ZERO packaging, which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box.

Affordable; just right screen size,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S8. I love the bigger screen size. I miss the physical thumbprint on my old phone, but the on-screen one on the S21FE is very responsive. After reading about all the issues people have had with the Pixel 6, I was wary. This phone exceeded my expectations. It is very responsive and the screen size is just right. For my older eyes I can read well, and will just fit in my back pocket [inside of a Spigen case].The sound is good as I place calls on speakerphone or listen podcasts while I mull around the kitchen.The battery is average, it is great that it can be charged wirelessly since having it in my jacket pocket while I cycle I get condensation and would not be able to charge it with a cable until it fully dries.I set my refresh screen to 60Mhz to save some battery and the scrolling is still smooth.To nitpick, it would be nice to have a SD card slot when I want to shoot a lot of pics or bring extra lectures (videos) to watch at my leisure.The modem has been great and I have been getting speeds of 300Gbps in Chicago (Metro by T-Mobile)I am very happy with this phone and think the icing on the cake was that it will get 4 android versions.

Samsung S20 FE 5G phone is outstanding!,"The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked.My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully.

I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they're forcing me to use their apps.

Big bang for your buck,"This phone is solid. It's interesting that in 2020, a ""budget"" phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren't as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less thanideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I'm not on my phone a lot, I easily get 2 days and squeezein a few hours from the next day if I really can't get to another charger. If I have a day off and I'm on the phone for hours,I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it's hit or miss sometimes. I have found thatif I pay attention to where I place my finger, it tends to recognize it more easily.I just never thought I'd miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing.The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you're coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker, you' enjoy them.. Definitelyget a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I'm finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit, they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don't expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale, it's a no brainer and very easy to recommend.",2020年12月28日 在美国审核
"very good phone for the price, Samsung bloatware is easier to deal with than in past years","Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600, it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range, but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case, you won't even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging, but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15, so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support ""USB-C PPS"" mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly, but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don't have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don't even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won't work if you don't have a Samsung account, but if you never use it, this isn't a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range, so I'm glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations), though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone, since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box, which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates, but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still, 3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.",2020年10月29日 在美国审核
Cable included,"I was alarmed when I got this phone because the included cable plugged into the phone at both ends of the cord.Two small plug-ins.I don't have any adapters that would fit that it make this work as a usb connection.What I realized later is that my old Samsung charging cord works with it, and that has a usb adaptor that can work in my car.The included cable is actually supposed to be used to transfer data from your old phone to your new phone!!How about that?I didn't use that, but used the QR code the new phone gave me and the bluetooth connection and easily transferred all my data, even before I have gotten a sim card for it.Bravo, Samsung.",2022年2月6日 在美国审核
"Flagship updates, features and speeds, at a fraction of the price! BUT NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!!","I've had this phone for quite a while now, and am absolutely loving it. I've been noticing amazing battery life (16 hour days of moderate optimized usage), games amazingly (runs Genshin Impact losing about 9-14% per hour), absolutely NO stuttering, and the camera is pretty good too.Things this phone doesnt do as well as the note 20 ultra.Multitasking. If you want to have more than 3 apps open in the background and resuming where you left off, you wont get that here.Camera. There is 30x, but no 100x, zoom (not a big deal for me, but that might matter for you) And it probably isn't QUITE up to par with the pictures in the end.No pen. The s-pen can be very useful, but you wont get it here.There are a few other small things, but this is all the big things I've noticed.CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT!!!!THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!If none of these things are deal breakers, GO BUY THIS PHONE!

"Great phone, especially for the price.","The CPU is fast and the phone has enough RAM to the point where your phone doesn't freeze up opening certain apps. The storage space is generous and the SD card slot area is pretty dope as well. It may seem inconvenient, unless you're upgrading from an android phone that had a back piece where you could take out the battery. The camera shoots in 4K and allows you to focus on an object.For those of you who don't know what 4K is, think 4K HD a certain adult film companies uses cameras of this quality, lmao.The price is reasonable, especially for all the features, storage space, RAM and other specs that this phone has. The camera is on par with most newer iPhones if not better. It's approximately as big as the iPhone 13 Pro Max and faster. I've tested this out personally. The Samsung FE series is quite a refreshing experience. It's well worth the price.Oh ANOTHER THING. If you like decent headphones, this phone sports a newer version of bluetooth connectivity. It will have better connection to wireless earbuds, wireless headphones, smart TVs, bluetooth speakers, cars that support bluetooth, etc.The colors are of a nice variety and the display is beautiful. You can watch videos in 4K quality. It is also, a legit pro gamer phone. No game I've played has ever lagged. The download speed is pretty impressive as well.Overall, if you prefer Samsung phones or great phones at reasonable prices, then I'd recommend this phone via Amazon.The best function is the Bluetooth tethering. You can share your phone's wifi/data with another device WITHOUT it using your mobile hotspot data AND WITHOUT being charged. You can even charge another Qi compatible device off this phone or charge this phone off a Qi compatible device.I apologize for the rant, lol.Also, so far as of June 2022, this is the last high end Samsung phone with a micro SD card slot.You also power off the phone differently. You don't need to hold the ""power button"" on the side of the device. Screenshots are also different. You hold the ""power button"" and the volume down button at the same time for one second.This phone can also block Apple ID.

120hz screen has issues,"The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums, this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn't work out well. Not sure if it's something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn't corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity, you're not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone.",2020年10月19日 在美国审核
Love everything about this phone,The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought.I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus.That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues.I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone.Its screen is vibrant and colorful.Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning.I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well.Some complain about the selfie camera.At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled.Everything here far surpasses all my expectations.Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines.Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent.This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner.With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it.I never got half a day with my Motorola.I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage.This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time.Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it.Highly recommend.,2021年10月7日 在美国审核
The best phone of 2020!!!,"Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time), the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand, the plastic back may seem cheap, but, it grows on you, also it won't break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn't disturb you when you are watching videos, movies, pic etc. Gaming, it will run very smoothly. Battery, if the phone starts at 100%, by the end of the day it won't be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen, which is like spreading butter on bread, you won't go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself, you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get, you won't get rip off. It's nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!",2021年4月13日 在美国审核
Verizon activation was smooth!,"I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate.I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device.I transferred using Smart Switch app, watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great.No Verizon calls, no Verizon store.This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon.I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn't figure it out.No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!",2021年6月30日 在美国审核
One of the best deals today; we got three of them in our family over the past year,"I believe, it is one of the best deals available for a new, established brand name, Android phone. My son got one of these first, I got one for myself half a year later, and recently we got one for my wife. The reasons which we like this phone are as follows:1) It still accepts SD cards (newer Samsung phones do not). You can add 256 GB of flash memory for pictures and video for $30. The same upgrade of memory with the latest Samsung phone models would cost you about $200 (they charge at least $100 per 128 GB of built-in flash - a street robbery!). If you need more memory, you can plug in SD card with capacity up to 1 TB. You can store huge number of movies on it.2) It comes with a charger. An extra charger never hurts. This is a slow 15 W charger, but it does its job - charges the phone over about 2-3 hours. I usually leave it plugged in overnight.3) This phone has a very good, for a smart phone, battery life. With active use through the day, the battery comfortably lasts through the day. If the phone used only for phone calls and occasional e-mail checks, the battery will last for two days or longer.4) Cameras work quite well. Resolution is good, image quality is good. The phone has three camers with different focal length, plus front side camera. Perfectly sufficient for all reasonable uses.5) The screen is big, but not excessively huge. The phone is just right size to fit into the hand comfortably.6) We use it on ATT prepaid plan. It is fully compatible with ATT Wireless and is fully supported.7) It is nominally 5G, but this in reality translates into more DRAM and a little better camera and nothing more. There is no true 5G in the U.S. (thankfully - I do not want to carry a microwave source next to my body!). If you go to ATT web page, you will learn that there are three flavors of 5G, the first two of them are nothing but marketing tricks.AT&amp;T 5G using low-band spectrum reaches more than 277 million people in more than 18,000 cities and towns in the U.S. This is slightly upgraded 4G LTE. There is nothing 5G in it. This is what you get from all major carriers, sold to you as ""5G"". It is just a little bit faster than regular 4G.AT&amp;T 5G+ using recently introduced C-Band spectrum sits between our other two bands and provides a great combination of ultra-fast speeds and wide geographic coverage. This has very little availability, and it is still not true 5G yet.AT&amp;T 5G+ using millimeter wave spectrum delivers super-fast speeds and unprecedented performances in high traffic areas including parts of more than 40 cities and more than 40 stadiums and venues. Availability of this is extremely limited in very limited selection of places, pretty much, nowhere.8) All three S20 FE phones in our family so far have been working very well, they are solid, reliable, and well made.The downsides are few. One, I am missing a headphone jack. I have a couple of Boise noise cancelling headphones (no BT) which I would like to be able to connect. With this phone, I need a USB-C to headphone jack adapter to accomplish it. $10 - $15 is not a big deal, but it is very easy to lose.Second downside, this phone still has that useless, annoying Bixby, but it got less annoying compared to my old phone. Finally, there are very few pre-installed apps and very little work is needed to clean them up.I do not play games on the phone, so I cannot judge if it is good for gaming. Probably, for latest games one needs the newest, fastest phone. For youtube or movies stored on the phone, it works perfectly well.The screen has good resolution and is silky smooth, at 120 Hz.I am convinced, it is a great phone to get in the Android family, as long as it is available.",2022年5月23日 在美国审核
Best of the S20 in a cheaper(but not worse) package,"Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap, I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone, definitely worth the price cut. It's actually better since you don't have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I'm used to, coming from the S8, but not slow and doesn't always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great, lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left, go to sleep, wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight, so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great, not a professional camera reviewer, go check out reviews on YouTube.",2020年10月17日 在美国审核
Great phone!,"I'm a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7, and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven't been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series, but couldn't stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price, I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged, no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day, and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool, but I haven't had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone, DO IT!

Decent phone for the money,"This SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G was not my first choice, but since LG has stopped manufacturing phones, it was my second choice.Replacing my LG Style 6, which measures over 7"", this Samsung phone is smaller but still comfortable to use in most regards.Most phones I and my wife have had these past several years have their fingerprint reader on the back of the phone, which is much easier to use and more comfortable.The Samsung S20 FE has a fingerprint reader embedded on the bottom of the screen, which is a bit awkward to use.But the fingerprint reader is fairly accurate providing you follow the directions and scan multiple areas of your fingertip.The screen is vibrant with deep colors &amp; good contrast.Since my phone is primarly a phone that I occasionally use for texting, I haven't used the camera yet nor do I use all of the features associated with video.I have my dozen or so apps that I use frequently, and they all work well on this phone.There isn't much bloatware installed by Samsung; most of it is installed by Google.I do seem to get a bit better connection with this phone.<br>Setup was a breeze.I use ConsumerCellular as my carrier, and all I had to do was move my SIM and microSD cards from the old phone to this new phone, and everything was automated after that!I used the SmartSwitch app to transfer from the LG phone to the Samsung phone, and that went smoothly, easily and without issue.</br>",2022年3月15日 在美国审核

This is the perfect phone(that is not an iphone),"I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony, pixel 5, and s21 ultra.Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues, Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn't enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic, but I couldn't justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium, but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright, and it's not 4k but you can't tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung's interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn't feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again, and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I'm a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone.

Great Phone by Samasung,"Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone, smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn't have a charger with the package) the camera is great, I'm a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics, another good feature is that is made in South Korea, some parts maybe made in China, but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice.

Better than expected,"Edit: I'm a super heavy user.I'm at about the 6 month, and now the device gets warm when it's taxed or the weather is a little warm.And the battery life, whuch is still great, and dropped down significantly.Love the phone.Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit:one month in, and I love it!Battery lasts all day, and I'm on my phone nonstop.I'm used to the change in buttons and actually like them.Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method, mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it's well protected.Signal is great on tmobile.5g is slower than 4g, so I turn it off.but I'm out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors!Updates get sent all the time.So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens.For me it's a fun binoculars, but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance.S9 couldn't do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9.The rest is pretty similar.---It's only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9, but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to, but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh, and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I've read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it's the same width as my old phone, but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews, and how new this was. But this was cheaper, and so far I'm very happy with my choice.Please note, red it definitely an orangey red.I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I've also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it's not available everywhere and you don't really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full.The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly, and it wasn't even very slow.The only things it didn't bring over werepaid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it's very slightly brighter than my S9. I don't have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven't had great luck with a fingerprint yet, but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!",2020年11月27日 在美国审核

I did a lot of research before getting this, and when it was announced, I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you're considering this phone, please look up ""MKBHD S20FE"" on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you're getting. I love it!",2021年5月26日 在美国审核
Flagship Features at a Great Price.,"After some research, I settled on this S20 FE 5g. It has flagship features for a reasonable price. Better than the S21 as I've learned. After using an iphone 5s for many years, wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging, expandable memory, fast processor, more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&amp;t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day.",2021年6月9日 在美国审核
Everything you need with a little of what you want,"Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first, the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great, the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+, so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things, this will suit you just fine.",2021年1月28日 在美国审核
Impressed,"I've owned the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for several months now and love it.Initially, I didn't like that it didn't include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update.This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area.The battery is excellent.I haven't received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call.The camera is excellent.Although it has 5G capability, I don't know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon.Oh, the top ""ribbon"" is a little tough to read.Its a great phone and at a great price.My wife likes it more than her iPhone.",2021年4月12日 在美国审核
Fun Features. Great battery life.,"I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said, I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies, YouTube videos, and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day, after countless hours using it.<br>I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it's DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it, because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away, or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors, your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.</br>",2021年8月3日 在美国审核
Great phone for a great price!,"Very happy with this item. This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though, the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box, the fingerprint sensor works great, but with the screen protector, it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that’s not a limitation on the phone, just the screen protector. Otherwise I’m very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!",2021年4月7日 在美国审核
A really nice phone but with Samsung software,"I love this phone. All of the reviewers' complaints about facial recognition and fingerprint access do not apply to me, because I do not use them. The transition from my old Motorola phone and my S21 FE I did myself with only a few problems. The screen is sharp, the size is comfortable and my applications run smoothly. The only app I have had trouble with is the Contacts app (Samsung), which will not let me edit Contacts. This problem is endemic in the S20s and S21s. I downloaded a Google app for contacts and had no more trouble.",2022年4月20日 在美国审核
"Cheap-o phone for sure, but still alright","I ordered this phone when Amazon said 8gb of ram... Showed up with 6gb, and now the site has been corrected. Good phone though!

TL:DR Worth,"So let's start with the screen.It's beautiful,responsive, reads my fingerprints accurately. And it's got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.Next up is signal.I live in a rural area so service is tricky,but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions,inside a manufacturing plant for example.Camera is on the list too,don't worry here we are. Overall it's a good camera.It's not the best camera out the,but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.The battery is impressive.I'm kinda hard on my phone battery,and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time.You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.All in all,I'm very satisfied with the phone and I'm sure many others feel the same.P.S.That Snapdragon is a monster.",2021年1月27日 在美国审核
"Gorgeous, durable phone","This phone is absolutely gorgeous in color, sleek, and has such amazing battery life. I do have to say, I chose the 20 FE specifically for the color and because it has better camera specs than the other phones in the 20 line. I love how fast it is, how well it connects to Bluetooth, the color on the screen, the camera features (both front and rear) and so much more. It is pretty durable too. I've dropped it without a single scratch or crack. The thing that I probably miss the most about my S9 is the curved edge as this phone is flat but it's obviously not a deal-breaker for me. I do also have pretty small hands so one-handed use is a little bit difficult even with a ring on the back of my case. Overall, I am very happy with this phone!",2022年3月3日 在美国审核
About the best unlocked Galaxy you can buy,"This is a gem of a phone. Perfect size, high end performance at a mid range price. Superb battery goes for DAYS with moderate usage. Can stream Netflix for 12+ hours on a charge and still have 20 percent left. Premium hardware, Samsung fully supports the US version so you get all the updates. I like the ""unlocked by Samsung"" setup, no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO), get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.This isn't the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can ""buy once, cry once"" and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years. I'm very happy with mine and I think you will be too.",2021年11月21日 在美国审核

Even better in person!!!,"Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5Gas an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far, this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now, so that's a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer, it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short, a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen.",2021年1月10日 在美国审核

Amazing Mid-range Phone!,"I honestly haven't had any problems with this phone and I've had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it's a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn't willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20's. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera, while not the best on the market, still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone, I usually don't have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you're using it all day then the battery will drain quicker, otherwise yes it does last all day.

Best. Upgrade. Ever.,"I'm writing this review on this phone. I bought this after my S9 began to really slow down and stop working. This phone is, hands down, amazing for the price. I've only used my portable charger once since buying this phone and that was when I first got it and the phone was at around 50%. I was so used to my old phone dying I didn't realize the battery life on this one was great. I can leave my house at 9am at 80%, use Bluetooth and play around on it almost all day, use snapchat and text and watch videos on it, and come home by 9pm to 20% and it can still go for another hour.I've used this phone up to 5% with no real issues and for someone who's out the house for hours at a time, this is great news.The fingerprint reader is, in my opinion, better than the S9 and in a better place. The facial recognition is also great. And the ability to transfer all my data AND keep my pages in the exact same layout was, no doubt, AMAZING!The only MINOR complaint I have is the lack of a microsd slot. I personally don't need it much but some might and I could see how that'll be an issue.",2022年4月6日 在美国审核

So far so good,"Just received the S20 FE today.Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot.Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data, but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing.Contacts, SMS/call history, app data, photos, videos, etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display.I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just 'get the phone up and running"" day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM.That was a selling point for me.When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know, now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault.",2020年10月4日 在美国审核
Massive upgrade at an affordable price!!,"I did a lot of research before coming to a conclusion to purchase this particular phone and let me tell you, this phone is beyond perfect, a MASSIVE upgrade from my Samsung galaxy S6 edge+.

You as the user have full control on how you want your phone to behave. And to top it all off, at an affordable price!

It feels premium (it basically is) but of course the higher end phones will have better specs and better looking screens. But this is probably the best phone on the market for this prices range. I recommend this phoneit's been treating me well for the past 2 weeks and hopefully it will last me long",2020年11月30日 在美国审核

The elephant in MY room,"What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder whyI wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I ""upgraded"" to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software, it is everywhere! It has it's hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But, again....maybe it's just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.Yes it's a good phone, it should have a bit more ram for what it is, I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can't believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves.",2021年3月14日 在美国审核

Even my S6 is more premium! This is what happens when you let influencers glow about everything, without calling the downgrades out! I've never been so disappointed in a product.

Touch screen issues!,"If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers, stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It's very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different, unintended direction.<br>It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can't patch it within my return period, it's going back.Other than that, yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price.</br>",2020年11月2日 在美国审核

"Ah, politics...","This is a beautiful, capable, reasonable smartphone, but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger, either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand, but that failed in the same manner, Attempts to get help from Samsung's support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones, but the newer 9W version did, so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone, and initiated a return procedure to Amazon, intending to request a simple 'return and replace with identical item', but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process, I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour 'chat' with Amazon technical help, who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help, who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center, which is 2.5 hours away, with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved, I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it's arrival, I quickly transferred all app, data, etc from the old phone to the new phone, swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers, even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient, but when people get involved, the efficiency is subject to total loss, simplicity is gone, and patience becomes a victim.",2021年1月29日 在美国审核

Better Than The A Series,"Overall I like the phone. It's definitely missing basic features like a headphone jack, that I enjoyed on my Samsung Galaxy A52.That being said, the thing with Samsung phones is that the battery could be twice this size and it'll only last as long as the average time of other brands. Samsung has horrendous battery managent because they force you to always run their bloatware. You can't uninstall them and some you can't remove notifications or stop from running.In general I really like the camera and the screen. You can't get the specs that this phone has for the sale price. It does have smaller cameras but it's about the software and the sensors being used here. I can have a phone with 100+ megapixels and still lack the details that this phone provides. It's why I turned down similar Motorola, Nokia, TCL and other branded phones.I also wanted dust resistance which this phone is good at. Truthfully, LG phones blew these Samsung phones out of the water. But hype and brand popularity kept Samsung chugging along while real competition got removed. So now I'm stuck using this phone until another company comes along. But it is a good phone! So no worries there. You just won't have good battery life. Also Samsung phones are notoriously slow chargers, my 5yr old phone charges faster than this thing. I'm talking about older than 2010 speeds. Definitely buy a fast charger! It's needed just to get average speeds.",2022年3月23日 在美国审核

Not worth the money,"I've by chance had a total of three of these in my family, so have a decent handle on them.For the specs on paper, it seems a good deal.But it's a problematic phone.Firstly, build quality is inconsistent.One was perfect, and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone.Second is battery life...for such a large battery, it doesn't feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues.Just Google it.All of ours have it, and it will drive you nuts.The updates were supposed to help, and did to some extent, but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying.I wouldn't bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted.",2020年10月31日 在美国审核

I've already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn't always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can't delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren't many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use, no bloatware. Just free and empty, lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5.",2020年11月2日 在美国审核
CHECK SYTEM CAPABILITY,the phone I PURCHSED is not compatible with GLOBAL SYSTEM NETWORK,2020年10月10日 在美国审核
Do not buy this phone.  As far as I am concerned this phone is a complete piece of trash.,"The phone works well as a phone, past the 5G switching not being completely worked out, but that is a carrier issue.I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal isroaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper.The touch hardware is complete and utter trash.The October firmware update helped a bit.The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid.If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger, it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times, and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so.I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear.Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they're both on the same horizontal plane, and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work.Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because ""Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right, unless it explodes..."".Well, apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes, Samsung.A screen.That's your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer.And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned ""Games"" in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue.Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned), second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung, the Requested replacement), replacement phone has same exact issue.Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup.100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.",2020年11月1日 在美国审核
Acceptable phone. Won't impress in any way.,"This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. Themodified version of Android, Samsung's One UI, does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader), but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I'd give that up, but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought.",2020年11月6日 在美国审核
I guess it all works because it's new,Why am I picking stars on features I do not care about.There is no way I am using Face recognition or a Fingerprint reader.I use the phone to call people and answer text messages.My reason for the feedback is that Amazon placed a $700 brand new phone in a box with one little air bubble wrap and the thing is bouncing around.A little common sense would be great.It's an expensive electronic device.This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can't even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this.,2020年12月11日 在美国审核
"Decent, it Depends on Your Priorities","I ended up returning this phone. It’s a really good phone but I just personally didn’t like how lightweight it felt and how large it was, or that the case was plastic. It’s a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect, I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter, a bit less saturated, and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I’ve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway, if you want a feather light, huge, very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera, this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally.",2020年12月3日 在美国审核
"Great all around phone, disappointing camera and fingerprint reader","Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8, the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper, in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible, especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you",2021年5月31日 在美国审核
The phone does work but with some notable flaws,The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes &gt;5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is &gt;20' away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don't use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I'm in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don't cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn't turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn't seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9,2020年12月22日 在美国审核
Touch Screen Weird,"I've been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won't track my finger completely, when I'm scrolling text. It's really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn't work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one, probably 10-20 times per day it won't read my fingerprint right, and I have to do it a second, third, or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I'm taking pictures with it, sometimes the camera app will ""freeze"" for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it's working, but just won't take a picture, no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.One time it stayed ""frozen"" so long that the ""camera app has stopped responding"" thing popped up.",2021年4月8日 在美国审核

After having the phone for 6 months the middle of the phone became a dead spot. Every time I would tap on it nothing would happen. Now, the phone has been freezing up or closing the window I have open. There have been several updates lately. After the last two, my Galaxy watch will disconnect from my phone when I walk to another room. Very frustrating. I'm seriously considering getting a new phone. I love Galaxy phones. This is my third one. But, the issues with this phone are things that shouldn't be happening for another 2 years.",2022年3月9日 在美国审核

Also it registers lines which you didn't make.Also unlocking with fingerprint is a nightmare. 70% of the time it doesn't recognize my fingerprint and I have to type my password after five failed entries.Camera is taking the worst photos with not so great coloring and kind of blurry images.Especially with the front camera I was never able to take good picture quality since it is fixed focus.This is the worst phone I have ever has as Samsung.so unhappy with it. and returning it.Not recommended at all!",2021年1月2日 在美国审核

Good value for money if you buy it on sale,"Bought the 256GB version when it was on sale for $599 on Amazon which was a very good buy.Overall it's a decent flagship phone, some may say lower tier flagship which I could understand. Performance is alright but it's Android so you will occasionally get app freezing every now and again. Camera is good (not great) but pixel 6 is better. I love the many many features that Samsung that this device comes with such as Bixby routines (game changer), Samsung Dex, secure folder, good lock, RAM Plus, a customizable always on display, edge panels, link to windows for synchronization with a windows computer, smart widgets (stacking multiple interactive widgets together that can rotate) video call effects with apps such as duo as duo, WhatsApp, MS Teams, zoom. The screen recorder actually captures the audio from a zoom or Google meet etc. Battery life is good enough once you don't use 120hz all the time (Bixby routine can help with that).This phone will get 4 years of OS updates and 5 years of security updates so that's really great for longevity.Wouldn't recommend it for $699 but if you see it on sale for much less (you certainly will on Amazon) then go for it",2022年5月6日 在美国审核

Very good,"Overall, I like the phone.It's fast, stable, and feature packed.I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me).I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive, yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint, it's how the camera physically protrudes from the phone.Not much, but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case).This might be necessary for the camera's features and the ""thinness"" of the phone, but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass.While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass, they don't stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good, but I don't like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn't otherwise sit flat outside of a case.",2021年11月20日 在美国审核

AT&amp;T and Samsung both said it is a Dual Sim phone. It is not.,"AT&amp;T shut off both of my numbers for the Ulefone Note 9P. That is a great phone with working Dual Sims, looong battery life, and expanded memory. The didn't tell me they were shutting off my device they just did it. After a back and forth, I learned the Ulefone company is not partnered with AT&amp;T, so they were rejecting their unlocked devices in the U.S. I went to the AT&amp;T store, and I was told the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G would work with dual Sims on the AT&amp;T network. They didn'thave any on stock other than the display that features two sim slots. I checked Samsungonline and it also advertisedthe dual sim US functionality.Finally, I came to Amazon and I purchased it after verifying the dual physical sims. It cost me $634 with tax. My Ulefone that worked great cost $120-$130 also on Amazon. I was willing to pay 5 times more for a slightly less powerful phone because of AT&amp;T's stance on non partner unlocked phones and Samsung and AT&amp;T's verifyingthis was a Dual sim capableproduct. After receiving it, I used AT&amp;T's social media support to re-activate my line via a phone call. They said they didn't do the dual sim support and ended the call. After spending a couple hours transferringeverything- apps, passwords,pics, etc. - I finally reached Samsung chat support. After I submitted picture evidencethat it has 2 sim slots, Samsung came clean.

Camera Unusable,"I've been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.<br>Now that I have it, I'm sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma, no visible damage, but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless, but that's the most important one.I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.Anyway, I'll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven't decided yet.</br>",2021年9月18日 在美国审核
touch screen way too sensitive,"Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen.Even with the ""block accidental touches"" option turned on, it is twitchy and very unpleasant.The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth, which was what I bought it for, so I'm going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can't be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me.Same for the google pestware.But I knew that from the git-go so can't complain.Still, listening to music is a blessing!My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers, it sounds like shit.But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that's the best I'll ever get.",2021年12月15日 在美国审核

Great speakers.,"My previous phone - LG G8 Thinq - was flaking out on me, the battery not holding anything like a proper charge.

The cameras review well and I was able to get a belt clip for it too.The best part by far though are the speakers, far louder and clearer than my previous phone or in fact any previous phone I've owned.

Decent enough phone but battery seems awfully weak,"I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to.

That being said, the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don't know if it's the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but, the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.Oh and, the 5g hasn't blown me away either...

But I had nothing but trouble trying to get my Bluetooth devices to hook up with it. After trying unsuccessfully to find a fix (both from Samsung and my auto manufacturer), and having to reboot by Fitbit multiple times today, I got so aggravated that I returned it (August 2020)I purchased this phone a second time (April 2021), hoping Samsung would have fixed the Bluetooth issues in the meantime. They have not. Again, I tried multiple solutions from multiple sources, from user groups to the manufacturer.

Great Phone but a CONFUSING Trade-off,"Ultimately, the S21 FE is a great phone.Before buying the phone, I was pretty skeptical especially after binging hundreds of reviews from the mobile community and YouTube. The reason why I decided to buy it however though is for 3 reasons; 1. Value for money; 2. Wanting to stay within the Samsung ecosystem and 3. The software support lifetime.For all reasons above and you may have read before, if you are wondering...the s21 fe DOES deliver!However, there is one (and a half) nitpick which influenced my 3/5 rating.1. (The half) - The battery life, though great seems a bit beneath the standard for modern smartphones, this can be attributed to the absence of an adaptive refresh rate on the display (so basically it's either ALL IN or 50% IN with your display)2. (The actual stuff) - The phone is advertised to be dual sim, heck even the model number indicates ""DS"" meaning ""Dual SIM"" and while the phone does have 2 SIM trays to back this up. The sad thing is, only ONE works at a time. The Quick Start Guide indicates that ""a software upgrade will be required..."" however so far I'm THREE (3) updates in and still no Dual SIM functionality. This will be pretty devastating to a lot of persons who travel internationally, however its even worse that Samsung is seemingly misleading its consumers with features but no functionality.",2022年6月20日 在美国审核

Overall it's just okay. Very annoying fingerprint sensor.,The phone has a lot going for it. It's fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don't love it.,2021年9月8日 在美国审核

"Great hardware, annoying to use.","Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear, speaker volume is much louder, things load fast, it's waterproof,, etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever, I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle, flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult, which causes me to tap things I didn't want to and drop it more. Overall, it works fine, or even very well, but it's simply unpleasant to use. I guess they've got to find some way to remind you that you didn't spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone.",2021年11月28日 在美国审核

A really disappointing Samsung product,"Totally disappointed with this phone. First off no charging brick and only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable.Guess they want you to buy a wireless charging pad for $35 to $70 and drag it with you where ever you go. Number 2 disappointment is it has a holder for 2 sim cards but it only uses the number 1 card and the number 2 is only a place holder, it is not a dual sim phone. Number 3, cannot add a micro SD card anywhere for data expansion, guess they want you to buy the more expensive 256 Gb with 8 Gb ram phone rather then providing a Micro SD card holder. And the final deal breaker is that it has very poor 2nd language implementation. When the 2nd language, in this case Thai is set as default language only about 30% if that is changed to Thai and the remaining 70% stays in English. I've had other Samsung and Moto phones where Thai as 2nd language is set as default and close to 95% of the phone is changed. And the problem that is pretty much the same with most Samsung phones is they are stuffed full of useless Samsung apps. Will be returning as paying $650 for this phone at this time is way too much considering what IMHO I don't like about this phone.",2022年3月21日 在美国审核

What the hell,"Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered anotherissue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn't do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn't work or if i can't do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it, this isn't ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn't work.

Missing Important Features,I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text.

"Just when I was out, Samsung pulls me right back in.","Around 2 years ago, I ditched my iPhone 8 Plus for a Samsung Galaxy S10e. All at once, I was frustrated with what I was missing sticking with Apple. Why should I continue to pay more for $800+ phoned without OLED screens, with only one camera, and with needlessly restrictive software, when things on the Android side of the smartphone game are better than ever? I switched and never looked back.As my time with the S10e wore on, I was troubled by the direction Samsung seemed to be taking. Their prices were going up, and their technology was not advancing at the rate I had once found wonder in. The S20 starting at $999 was just icing on the cake of fear; had Samsung led us all on? What phone was next for me when my S10e finally gave up the ghost? I pushed away OnePlus, Google, and other midrange phone manufacturers for months; until the announcement came.I picked up my S20 FE 5G on launch day, and have been blown away by it every second of ownership. For a $700 dollar phone, it blows all preconceived notions of ""midrange"" out of the water. For starters, the screen is absurd. An HDR10+, 120 Hz, Super AMOLED of this size? Are you kidding? It's amazing. And the 4500 mAh battery has no issues driving it; I've gone a couple of days between charges by this point. The cameras are absurd too, especially the 32 MP selfie camera; the sharpness is honestly too much sometimes.Also, the plastic back is nothing to worry about in the slightest. Not only is it actually aesthetically pleasing, but it's solid and easy to grip. I have no qualms there. The phone as a whole is lightning-fast in kind. As a Verizon user, my 5G experience is very limited, so I can't attest to it's usefulness in this review; but I'm sure it's fine!My only qualm with this phone would have to be the bloatware; we should be done with all these Zynga apps being preinstalled. However, it takes 10 minutes or so to uninstall them. I can't knock it because of this.Let me be clear; this phone is the way to go. We are at an amazing point for smartphones; why not really care about something you use most of the day? We go to work on our phones, we attend class on our phones, and we consume most, if not all, of our entertainment on our phones; go with something that works for you. This phone does for me to an almost fervent degree.",2020年10月9日 在美国审核

Some pros &amp; cons when upgrading from S9 to S20 FE,"I took advantage of the T-mobile trade-in program to upgrade my aging early 2018 Samsung S9 64GB to this new late 2020 Samsung S20 FE 128GB which allowed me to get this phone for $200 + taxes. Overall, it's a very good phone for the price even without trade-in, but there are some pros &amp; cons which I'm going to lay out below.*** Pros:- Price / Affordability. Obviously this is the biggest pro of the S20 FE as you can upgrade to one of the newest phones from samsung for not too much without having to shell 1000 dollars or more.- The S20 FE has 6GB of RAM which is an upgrade over the S9's 4GB of RAM. Although looking at my Android's settings Device Care info, I seem to see a larger RAM usage for the S20 FE (around 3.4GB usage without any apps open which leaves about 2.6GB available when idle, versus around 2GB of available space when idle for the S9. So you gain a little but not as much as expected. This may be due to the new upgraded Snapdragon 865 processor being more memory hungry than the outdated processor on the S9.- The S20 FE has 128GB of onboard drive space which is twice as much as the S9. So this is def a big plus. Also you can add up to 1TB of SDXC memory.- The Cameras are much better on the S20 FE than my old S9, no doubt. You benefit from the 3 camera setup with good performing lenses on the 0.5x, 1x and 3x lenses. As a professional in the photo/video business, it's very welcome and you will be happy with the S20 FE's camera performance overall. The selfie camera also is a big improvement over the S9.- The Fingerprint sensor placement is much better at the front of the handset below the display. A big improvement over the S9 which was at the back of the phone.*** Tie- In terms of overall performance and daily usage, I would say you get about the same performance as the S9. You won't notice that the S20 FE is snappier or slower than the S9 for most apps used. Browsing feels about the same, even though the S20 FE touts the 120Hz display, but has a lower pixel density in terms of screen resolution. Colorwise, they are about the same in terms of vivid colors or contrast/brightness.- In terms of battery life, I see to get about the same performance as my S9, even though the S20 FE touts a larger battery, but also has a bigger display so it evens out.- In terms of 5G performance, I tested it in a few places and I don't see much improvements in terms of Upload or Download performance over 4G LTE. It's very uneven depending on where you are. On T-mobile, I get about 40Mb/s to 90Mb/s downlink with 5G vs 50Mb/s to 75Mb/s with 4G downlink. and around 25Mb/s uplink for 5G and 4G similarly when I'm in a good area. So I decided to just switch back from 5G to 4G LTE settings on my android phone, so meh... as far as 5G is concerned... maybe this will improve over time.*** Cons:- My biggest con is the S20 FE definitely feels heavier and is much larger to hold than the S9. It is about the size of the S20+ and I wished they kept the width of the S9/S10/S20 so that one-handed usage is much easier. With a protective case added to the S20 FE, you will be hard pressed to use this phone one-handed unless you have big hands. I don't unfortunately. After all, they called it the S20 Fan Edition, so why make it so much larger? Samsung could have made the S20 FE taller but kept the S20 width... Food for thought for later iterations! Please keep this in mind Samsung. Not everyone wants a larger screen at the cost of having to use 2 hands all the time.- As others have said, why did they put the volume buttons on the right hand side? Why not keep these buttons on the left hand side? Probably because it's a two-handed device, so they thought, might as well have everything on one side so you operate it with your thumb... Poor design/UX in my opinion.- Loss of the 3.5mm phone jack. Alas this is becoming standard on most higher end phones from Samsung/Google/Apple... Sad... Now you have to use a dongle and can't charge &amp; listen to music with a wired headset at the same time unless you buy another heavier dongle with those 2 ports (USB-C &amp; 3.5mm) which may or may not work seamlessly... I decided to buy the Samsung 3.5mm to USB-C dongle because there doesn't seem to be a dual port dongle that works perfectly yet. And I don't like using bluetooth all the time with a wireless headset.- It's still early for the release of this phone, so you won't get many good covers &amp; screen protectors alas... I bought a clear cover from T-mobile TO-GO branded, and so far it is just too bulky &amp; uncomfortable of a cover and way more expensive than on Amazon. But the covers on amazon are not yet shipping... Something to bear in mind as you will pay 2x or 3x more via T-mobile to get those accessories right away.- One last small pet peeve, is the loss of the kind of clean wallpapers I had with the S9, now you get those flowery preloaded wallpapers that are just not UI friendly, they are too bright and busy so your icons &amp; Time/Date don't separate nicely from the wallpaper background... You gotta download themes/wallpapers from the Samsung Store to get some equivalent ones... but not exactly the same as S9 which were so nice.So in Summary, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G offers a nice cost effective way to upgrade your aging android phone that's say 2-years old or more... like it did for me with my former S9. You gain in RAM, drive space, and a larger display, but you lose in terms of one-handed usage and a heavier phone to hold, carry around, and larger to slip in your pockets, and no more 3.5mm headphone jack... sigh. There isn't much improvement in terms of performance, operability, or battery life over the S9, but at least you know that this S20 FE is close to being the latest and greatest from Samsungfor the next couple years until you upgrade again to another iteration... For me, it's a 4/5 star phone and is worth the upgrade from the S9 still but I'm missing my S9 already because it was so good at doing most everything with just one hand... now I gotta use 2 hands with this phone most of the time... but at least I have enough onboard fast memory space with 128GB which will allow me to add more apps/take more photos/videos when the apps need the speed of onboard memory to take the photo shot.",2020年10月5日 在美国审核

Doesn't get much better than this!,"I currently have a Galaxy Note 10 and before that the Pixel 3.The Note 20 has been great but I've been wanting to upgrade to something with a better battery.I've tried the Note 20 Ultra (too big and bulky) and the Note 20 (not worth $999 or even $799) and finally arrived at the S20 FE.So far, the battery life has been great with 6-7 hours screen on time.Compared to the Note line and pretty much everything else in the marketplace right now, this is a fantastic device at this price point.The screen is as good as the Note 20 line with its great color accuracy, sharpness and bright screen.While it doesn't have WQHD+ like the Note 20 Ultra, it does have 120hz which the Note 20 doesn't.So if you're running 120hz, you can't use WQHD+ anyway.This device also has a fantastic camera system that takes better shots than the Note 20.I've compared them side by side and the S20 FE delivers more vibrant and sharper images.While the telephoto is only 8MP, it didn't seem to effect the quality and outputs pictures that were just as good as the Note 20.The Note 20 Ultra has an amazing telephoto, so if that's important to you, then go for it, but costing about $500 more than this device, seems not worth it.If you're a Pixel user, One UI is an adjustment but I actually enjoy it with all the options it brings. Unlike past Samsung devices, their OS doesn't slow things down in the least and this phone is as fast as the Note 20's that I also tried out.Samsung has also been great about doing monthly updates and will be giving 3 years OS support on the S20 FEI do wish it came with 8GB instead of 6 but I haven't noticed any performance issues as a result - the device feels just as fast and fluid as the other more expensive phones I tried with much more RAM.Perhaps if you're a gamer or heavy multi-tasker, this might be a bigger factor to consider in your decision to buy this device.I've seen comments about the finger print scanner being unreliable but I haven't experienced that at all.In fact, it's been much more reliable and way faster than sonic ones in the newer Note 20 devices I tried.If you're considering this over the Pixel 5, the S20 FE seems the better value with better CPU, 120hz screen and more versatile camera system (but the Pixel will undoubtedly take better pictures as its the camera king!), expandable storage, bigger battery and faster charging.If you're considering this over the Note 20 (standard not Ultra), the S20 FE is a much better value for less money giving you 120hz screen, expandable storage and better camera.Unfortunately you lose out on the S-Pen with the S20 FE, but if you can go without, then the S20 FE is a much bigger bang for your buck.At the end of the day, I think this phone is a superb value at $599 and the best you can get at this price point.",2020年10月7日 在美国审核

unsettling,"Enjoy the always-on OLED with punch hole.Just peek at the phone and you know the time &amp; notifications.Always-on is the best feature.Perfectly happy with the styling and performance.Wish the battery could be user accessible-but that is a personal opinion.I was prepared to purchase a 25W charger, but after experiencing the bundled 15W, I sense that 5V 3A is nice balance between faster and cooler operation that will probably prolong the working life of the battery.Similarly for the Qi wireless charging which is naturally inefficient and runs even hotter.I am shopping for aftermarket chargers, but no hurry.The set of bundled apps is unsettling and in need of attention.A first clue was when ""calendar"" did not sync properly.Turns out that Samsung has an entire set of unbranded applications spoofing basic Google apps including:phone, calendar, contacts, my files, clock, gallery, messages, and more.What is unsettling is that these Samsung apps are UNBRANDED presumably to lull consumers into believing they are Google branded apps.It seems this required many gatekeeper failures including but not limited to:Google App certification approved a set of""unbranded"" apps to exist.The trickery continues with unbranded notifications with no explicit indication which app is requesting access to personal information.For example, is enabling ""Find My Phone"" a prompt from Samsung, Google, the data provider, and/or some other entity?There are also unbranded notifications that appear from hidden Apps that are not readily located such as ""Carrier Hub"".[Try to find that in my apps.]The many overlapping and redundant requests for permissions to parse messages, mail, files, locations, settings, behavior, calls, logs, sounds, videos,swipes and keystrokes because concerningly invasive when the asking party is anonymous.Some permissions such as Bixby cannot be changed.Another sloppy mistake was a terms and conditions click to agree screen that was missing the actual terms and conditions statements.Surely the EU, California CCPA, and other laws prohibit such deception.The out of the box experience can be daunting.Many steps and ""insider knowledge"" are required just to turn on and configure the phone.Setup can be never-ending.Each time you want to turn on the phone:you have to pick up the phone, tap twice, wait for facial recognition to fail, swipe up, enter password, swipe up to get to a home button, hit home, then navigate to where you want to be.Shipping an obsolete version of Android is disappointing and let's just say there is some opportunity for software updates to improve.A minor tip:The sim tool is hidden in a secret compartment of the retail box.For my experience, the retail box is tight fitting.After removing the top cover, it is very easy to miss a secret compartment stuck inside the top cover containing the pin used to pop open the sim slot.There was a white piece of blank paper that made it appear to have a false top.The useless instructions also happen to be in that compartment.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核
Samsung Galaxy S20 FE – 18 Months Later,"The S20FE, redefined what it meant to be a budget flagship, and a premium mid-range device. Still, nearly 2 years later the value is still ever present. The device has been my daily driver since October of 2020, and this is my take on the handset. Keep in mind, this device launched at $700, I only paid 450$ with device trade in. Let’s go over the basic specs:- Snapdragon 865 CPU- 6GB RAM/128GB ROM or 8GB RAM/256GB ROM- Wifi 6- 5G- 6.5 inch AMOLED display- Under-Display fingerprint sensor- 4500 MAH battery- Gorilla Glass 3 on the front display.Pros:- All-Day battery life. As the strange advertisements suggested this device can get me through a day of moderate to heavy usage. My usage time is upwards of 8 hours on some days. It doesn’t perform as well as when I first got it but it does still last all day, easily.- Display. The AMOLED display is sharp, crisp, and extra smooth with 120Hz mode enabled. It is great for content consumption.- Software. One UI on top of Android is not for everyone. Samsung has a distinct flavor that isn’t stock. But, Goodlock from Samsung puts the power in my hands to change most things like colors, icons, etc. The customization is crucial for me so I don’t mind One UI’s more questionable styling choice because of its flexibility. Plus, 4 years of software updates is always something to appreciate from an android handset. Google is the next closest competitor to this standard.- Rear Camera. The back 3 cameras have been everyday champions at capturing the moments that I want to share with my friends and family. The newest iPhone’s will certainly beat this device especially in night photography, but overall its pictures are sharp, colorful (maybe a bit saturated), and high quality. Video too has been great and the camera app has useful tools to make pictures and videos even more special.Cons:- Gorilla Glass 3. Being a daily driver, this device has been everywhere with me. My last device, the galaxy s8 had Gorilla Glass 5. I am not super clumsy, but I have been known to drop my phone occasionally. I had been lucky for the first 12 months to not have any cracks, but my screen did get a crack across the middle after a 4ft drop from my waist as I was putting things into my car. So, keep a screen protector on this device if you are prone to the occasional drop or two. Gorilla Glass 3 is super scratch resistant, but it couldn’t stand the drop.- Size. This one is super dependent on who you are as a person and how your hands are. I have hands that are on the smaller side. The galaxy s8 was the perfect size. Coming to this phone which was taller and wider proved at first to be a bit of a challenge. I can’t stress just how large this phone is compared to a standard iPhone. The device was comfortable to hold but my small hands would sometimes drown in the sheer size of it all. But, This is entirely like, a me problem haha.- Front Camera/Facial Recognition: the front camera is a little disappointing. For me, I hated the small metal rim on the display. It ruined the bezel-less clean look for me sometimes. But, especially with facial recognition. It isn’t any kind of fancy 3D scanning IR like apple uses, its just 2D facial scanning. Which isn’t great. You can register a face, but it isn’t reliable in any sense and it just doesn’t hold the bar.Odds and Ends:- Touch Sensitivity: When the device first came out in 2020 there were reports of touch sensitivity problems and instances of ghost touches. My device had this issue at first but then a software update and calibration did fix my issue of touch sensitivity. I haven’t had any issues since. But on release, it was a bit rough. I think though, the software update fixed this issue for most individuals- Under-Display Fingerprint Sensor: This device comes with an optical fingerprint sensor under the display which is kind of futuristic. But it can be hit or miss. For me, after a few software updates it is almost always pretty solid and consistent. There are times when my finger is on the display at a weird angle, and it won’t unlock but it is fast and mostly reliable. It is not as fast as rear-mounted scanners like on the Galaxy S8 and S9 series. But it has gotten better since release. Now, it should be a pretty okay experience to use.Overall, this device has been an amazing value for me over these past 18 months. It has gotten 2 software updates so far, and they still have 2 more to receive. The device should get up to android 14 according to Samsung’s 4 years of support. So, it still has lots of life left in it, and anyone considering this in 2022 should still buy this device. It is not the newest device, but it is solid in terms of its performance and value.",2022年5月15日 在美国审核
Great with a few flaws,"I wanted to love this phone. It's flat display with a highend chipset and good cameras is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately it has a few small flaws that will have me returning it.1. 6gb of ram, not the end of the world. But, it does hold back the 865 from performing as well as it can. Again not a huge deal, but I felt I should mention it.2. Too dim of a screen, this is the killer for me. No matter if on automatic brightness or not. The maximum screen brightness is too dim for me in outdoor scenarios and the screen washes out too easily. This is the reason I feel like I have to return this phone.Too be fair, if you don't need or use your phone in outdoor lighting, this thing is great otherwise.",2020年10月6日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price,"For $600, I would say this is a pretty good phone for the price. I have had mine for a week now and am pretty satisfied. Coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy Note 8, this is a good upgrade. You can check out the specs on any Samsung's page, so I'm just going to list my personal pros and cons. Most of my cons are relatively minor when taking into account the phone is $600 new.Pros:Price - $600 new is a great price. The only other phone I was considering was the Google Pixel 5, which is $100 more.Battery life - The S20 FE lasts a full day easily even with 120hz turned on. Coming from a phone with a 3-year old battery that was struggling to make it the full day, this is a big plus for me.Back cameras - The back cameras are a big upgrade from my previous Note 8. The Note 8 was fine if there was enough light, but as soon as things got darker, photos went downhill. The photos I have taken so far on the S20 FE look great.120hz - Scrolling and animations are very smooth. I don't play any games on my phone other than Genshin Impact or TFT once in a while, so this was a nice plus rather than a must have for me.MicroSD card slot - I store all my photos on my SD card, so the S20 FE having a slot for that is nice.Flat screen - As someone who quickly got annoyed with the curved edges on my old Note 8 rendering it unusable without a case, the S20 FE's flat screen is a nice change.AOD - The always-on display was one of my favorite features of my Note 8 so glad to see it's still around.Size - I love big phones, and I love big screens even more. The 6.5-inch display is great, and the phone is about the same size as my Note 8, which has a smaller display. I have long fingers, so I don't have much issue using the phone.Cons:No headphone jack - By far my biggest complaint with the S20 FE is the lack of a headphone jack. I don't see why it's necessary to exclude the jack on Samsung's newer phones. Seems like a ploy to get consumers to buy their overpriced wireless earbuds. I had to buy some dongles on Amazon so I could use my existing headphones.Front camera quality - While the back cameras are impressive, the front camera is less so. The selfies I took with my girlfriend were kind of washed out and overly smooth. The 32mp photos don't look any better than the 8mp ones from my Note 8.Touchscreen issues - I have had touchscreen issues where instead of scrolling the screen will randomly register it as clicks instead. Most noticeable on Instragram where it'll click on random profiles instead of scrolling. So far, it looks like restarting the phone fixes these issues for a few days. Hopefully Samsung fixes this with a software update.Buttons - I am fine with Samsung moving the volume buttons to the right side. However, Samsung should have considered adding additional buttons to the left because now there isn't anything there. A do-not-disturb slider or a dedicated camera button would have been nice.Overall, I would recommend this phone for anyone upgrading. For $600, you get a great phone.Edit - July 2021 Update:Been using the same phone still since September of 2020. I saw this phone was on sale for $479 a couple weeks ago for Amazon's Prime Day. This phone is a no brainer at that price. The touchscreen issues were all resolved with a few software updates late last year. I have not encountered any touchscreen issues since then and don't have any further complaints in the past year. Battery life still lasts a full work day from 7am to midnight with around 25-30% battery life left.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核
Great Phone for the price,"Love the phone ,Not crazy about the buttons on one side because of the screenshot process,will get use to it.I used the S20 FE all day, more than usual, to see how the batterylife was and to me it was great.I upgraded from the Galaxy S9 because I was tired of constantly charging it.Do wish Samsung wouldgive the ok to have Otterbox and other companies have cases available when the phone is ordered.Well worth the money, did not want to spenda fortune for the S20.",2020年10月8日 在美国审核
Best big phone value out there,"If you want a big phone with state of the art features, the S20FE really has no competition.It does pretty much everything the more expensive S20 phones do at a much much lower price point. And if you have a decent phone to trade in (go the Samsung site for more details), it is practically a a steal. I traded S10e and got this one for $285.Hard to beat.There are few minor difference from the more expensive siblings, like a glass vs plastic back and a 10X vs 3X optical zoom. The screen res is bit lower on the FE but you would be hard pressed to notice the difference. It is great screen. Oh, and no millimeter 5G, just the low end version of 5G,which is all that exists now anyway in 95 percent of the US. And a lot of places don't even have that yet.If you can live with those minor shortcomings, this is the phone for you. Also be aware this phone is actually bigger than the S20 and almost as big as the plus.The super fast 120 refresh rate is a big selling point. Something almost no other phone, beyond the S20 lineup, has.Makes scrolling super smooth and fast. Stereo speakers sound better than most phones. Wifi 6 support. In screen finger printer reader works well.But also has face recognition unlock. Infinitely customizable, as most of Samsung's high end phones are.There are only a few downsides. It comes with a low end, regular than fast charger.But if you have an older Samsung phone with fast charger, itwill work here.Some idiot decided to do away with a simple power button. You have to press volume AND the Bixby button to turn if on or off. Insane.You can change that in the settings and make the Bixby button the power button (which should have been the default).Bixby (digital assistant) is a major pain in the butt, but you can drive a stake through its heart and get rid of it completelywith some effort.Google it.Many different settings must be changed.Overall, this is the best phone for the money I have seen in a long time.Don't bother with anything else if you want a state of the art phone.",2020年11月13日 在美国审核
Its nice,"I was skeptical about buying this phone since I was always a huawei/apple user. I got tired of apple because of the storage and my huawei phone no longer supports google due to the ban so I figured I picked up this phone despite the reviews. It is really nice. The fingerprint works well and the battery life and touch screen is nice. The screen is moderately big and it includes a microSD card for additional storage. Camera quality is decent. Its better than the iphone, but not better than the huawei one. The volume is 10x better than my iphone. Overall, for the fan edition its nice and at a decent price. It has everything a s20 has so I cant complain.",2020年11月10日 在美国审核

Plus the screen is AMAZING. LED 120hz it is very smooth and fast. The downside is the OS. APPLE has android beat hands down for OS smoothness, screen sensitivity (I am often cought touching the sides of the phone screen and clicking when I wasn't trying too on samsung.) Being 23 years old I can learn to navigate android but APPLE IS BETTER FOR 40+ years old! Next year will be switching to iphone 13 but battery life is good OS just needs simplification.",2020年10月8日 在美国审核
Great phone at a great price.,"Update#2: The reason you want to buy the Fan Edition of Samsung Galaxy phones is because you can use the Samsung DEX app. If you don't use the app than any android phone will work fine. But with the Samsung DEX app it makes all the difference. only the S phones are supported on the DEX app. Although the A series supports Windows Link. It's garbage compare to the DEX app.<br>Update: been using it daily for 3 months now. All the accessories for this phone is cheaper than the rest of the S20 lineup except the battery. The battery for this month is 3~5X more than other Samsung phones. Makes it expensive to repair, like if Samsung doesn't want you to replace it.So far I thought the FE 5G is a pretty good phone.You get the camera app of the s20 ultra.Pro camera settings you can only find on high end cameras.Dolby Atoms audio.Micro SD memory slot.yep it's a option that's missing on the S21s.Some minor issues.Bluetooth audio device missing battery % indicators.</br>",2021年2月9日 在美国审核
Good phone,"I got mine through ATT. I haven’t had any problems or issues. I use the Google Assistant a lot, and it’s better than Siri on my iPad. It brings up the results pretty fast and is usually accurate. This is really important to me. Battery lasts a long time, I can be on long conversations during the day and still have plenty of battery. It’s a large screen, which I like, especially having small screens in the past. But it’s smaller from side to side, and it’s perfect for me even though I have smaller hands. My photos are pretty good, I’m happy with them, and you scale it to way up close.This is a really good phone in my opinion. However, the best phone I’ve had is an Alcatel 3V, but they don’t make them anymore. The best battery life is Nokia, but that was when you couldn’t access the internet",2022年1月1日 在美国审核
Great phone,"I'm not a gamer with new toy. First thing was to disable/uninstall before temptation sets in. By doing so and using this phone for calls, messages, browsing, photos it is now been a 10 hour day and I still have 85%. The hardest part has-been finding a solution to butt calls to 911. Solved. No lock screen. Not worried as phone is with me. All accounts password protected. All apps are in folders so no problem there. Except I then had to disable ""gestures"" because of all the screens hots while in pocket. Bixby keeps coming on all by itself but somewhere I did see a remove Bixby button.Must have been once in a lifetime shot. Can't find it again. I think it is in a privacy setting. Pictures are good but honestly my old note 3 can compete. I had used fingerprint which works great but it brings back the chance of 911 calls. They should reconfigure the 911 button to bring up a dialer with just 3 numbers 091, then you can call 911 or operator. I got a case from caselogic and the plate charger has no problem. Also disable the phone suggesting stuff to me. Too stupid. These guys think I bought a traveling billboard. IT IS A PHONE. It would be sad to be addicted to a gamer, kill the battery and not be able to call for help.",2021年4月16日 在美国审核
Overall good phone for the price but has some issues.,"I switched from Motorola to Samsung after my Z3 started dying after mere months of use. There is no way I will ever pay a thousand dollars for a phone that will be obsolete within 2-3 years. That's just not going to happen. The S20FE seemed to have 90 percent of the features of the S20 at a reasonable price so I got it. It's definitely better in most ways than the Motorola and I'm happy with it so far.One thing to be aware of as soon as you power up is that stupid 120 Hz setting - turn it OFF immediately unless you want your battery dying in a couple of hours. It's really useless for most tasks and it's activated by default, which is why everyone is complaining about poor battery life. At 60 Hz my battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use.I got the 128 Gb version with 6 Gb ram from my Verizon store since I already had an account and they gave additional discounts for immediate activation. I then added my 128 Gb micro sd card so I should finally have enough storage and app space to breathe for awhile. The phone will accept up to 1 Tb cards.Screen brightness is disappointing. It's only half as bright as my $49 Samsung J3 I use to fly my drones. In fact it's only about the same brightness as my old Motorola. Not good in sunlight. Not happy about this at all. The little J3 will sear your eyes in daylight with boost mode! WTF? Why?!Another major flaw is the absurdly slippery case, which constantly tries to squirt out of my pocket or hands every time I touch it. I dropped it three times while waiting for my Spigen Rugged Armor case to arrive. All those nice colors this phone comes in are pointless since you are absolutely going to drop this phone at some point without a good case to cover all the slippery surfaces. Not MIGHT drop it - you WILL drop it. It's that hard to hold onto. I also contrasted this with my trusty J3. Again, the FE loses, since the J3 has an absolutely perfect tactile surface that was designed to be held, not dropped. The J3 surface is so perfectly designed I didn't want to cover it with a case - and I have NEVER dropped it! Again I have to ask - W.T.F.??? was Samsung thinking when they designed this S20FE phone?So the camera is very good for a phone camera. In fact it's better than some of my actual cameras. I experimented with photo, video, single take, slo-mo, and was very impressed with the quality I get without much effort. The 3x optical zoom I really like. It also digitally zooms to 30x in photo and 12x in video mode. I handheld full zoom with image stabilization and got surprisingly sharp results. I really like this camera. I useLapse It Pro when I want to take high quality time lapses so I didn't spend much time with the built in version but it seemed to do ok. There are very few adjustments on those modes.Bluetooth connects very well to my speakers at high quality. Also to my fitness band. Wifi is decent as well. Where this phone is a notch above my old Motorolas is in signal sensitivity. It picks up cellular signals in places my Droids were just dead. Like in an industrial building basement with lots of concrete and steel. I still had a data connection (slow) and could text.Headphones are questionable at the moment. My USB-c adapter doesn't work with this phone. I get an error saying it's not supported. Nothing at all about wired headphones in the manual. So I ordered Bluetooth buds (NOT Galaxy - since they pulled this cheap stunt I will not reward them) I ordered the TOZO T10 and will update whenI test them.Phone call quality is solidly above average but not great. Another feature that is actually better on my bottom of the line J3 phone!Overall, this phone is a good upper mid level option for those tired of the cheap $150 phones and don't want to spend a fortune on the latest gadget.",2020年10月17日 在美国审核
"An expensive, so, so phone","On paper the phone looks great. But coming from an S9, I wish I would not have purchased the S20FE. The virtual proximity sensor is awful. 8 times out of 10, it will inactivate the phone if it's against your ear. But 2/10 times it will not and if you are moving around while on the phone, you will dial other people, hang up, put the call on hold - you name it. The LED notifications are gone and replaced with on screen notifications. First thing I noticed was the charging screen notification, nothing will burn in a screen like repetitive text. The fingerprint scanner is worse than prior versions - again the S9, was far more advanced. The Gorilla glass 3 will be less impact resistant than the 5 used on other phones. The glass has an odd cheap feel, like I have plastic on it, but I don't. The camera produces ok shots, but all need some touchups when I get home. Either over exposed or too much contrast... Selphies are also pretty bad, the fixed focus just doesn't do a good job. Then there are the screen problems. I haven't quite figured this out, but I get ghost touches and ignored touches. Playing with the sensitivity does not resolve the issue.If you, like me spend a lot of time on the phone, you better get a headset, as using this phone, as a phone will result in hangups and all sorts of issues because of the crappy proximity sensor.I tested the Wifi compared to my wife's S9 and the S9 would consistently get &gt; 120Mbs, the S20FE was averaging just over 100Mbs. Used the same SSID and was in the exact location. So the S20FE loses the battle against the S9 in terms of screen quality and scratch resistance, fingerprint scanning, proximity sensor, typing accuracy and wifi speed. Pretty bad that a 2 year old phone is better than a brand new one.",2020年10月20日 在美国审核
"So-so responsive screen, but overall a good phone","Coming from Pixel 3a, S20 FE does feel like an upgrade. It's not mind-blowing, but I can see myself using this phone for quite some time before the next flagship. One big reason for the upgrade was 5G. To be honest, I can't quite tell the difference between 5G vs 4G LTE that I've been using... Still, I don't regret my purchase and going to keep using S20 FE.Pros:+ Look of the back: I really like the orange color and the matted texture. I really do. It just fits me.+ 120 Hz screen speed: it makes for a smoother scrolling when I'm reading the news or e-mail. However, it does eat up battery life+ Camera zoom: The range is 0.5x - 30x, which is more than what was possible in 3a.+ 128GB internal storage: plenty for me, a regular phone user to take pics and videos. There's an option to use a microSD, too, for additional storage.*Side bar: this is a useful feature of Samsung phones. A shortcut. Makes it easier to keep my screen looking clean and organized.*Spotify 6-mo Premium: I bought the phone from Samsung directly and it came with Spotify for 6 months.*Samsung Smart Switch App: made it easy to port data from 3a to FE.*Water-resistant: for Pacific Northwest, this is a must...So-so:*Camera:The camera features other bells and whistles like slow mo, hyperlapse, super slow-mo, and even food mode for social media. The camera is catered to social media for sure. FE has night vision, but tbh, 3a had better night vision mode. It's not the worst, but it's not the best.* Battery life: 3a had better battery, but play with the power mode, this phone can last a while. With heavy use, this phone will die on you fast on High Performance or Optimized. Can last you a day under medium power or light use. I had this phone go without a charge on a weekend camping trip, and was able to make it last by placing it on maximum power saving. Based on usage, the battery can last, just not past a day...*Screen (videos and pictures): it looks great. Colors do look a bit saturated when I took pictures with it. There are options to change to a more natural look, but default is the saturated look. Youtube, Netflix... Streaming is fine.Cons:* Bloatware and features: Coming from Google Pixel 3a, this phone comes with a lot of features right off the bat. Samsung proprietary apps do feel like bloatware, but not all of them are throwaways. Few are useful.* Screen (responsiveness): it falls short. Randomly, the screen becomes unresponsive to where my finger is. That makes it hard to unlock my phone. The phone becomes frustrating at random times because I can't unlock the phone or open an app.*Updates: no Android 11 yet...*Size:... it's big. It feels more like a tablet than a phone in my hands after a while. There is a one-handed mode, but ... the physical size is still big. At least, with such a mode, I don't have to stretch my thumb or fingers for too long. It's annoying though.Despite the shortcomings, for some reason, FE fits and gels with my needs for a phone. I can see myself using for 3 - 5 years. Even with S21 coming out, I think I'll stick with FE for a while until the next upgrade.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核

Mediocre Phone,"I am offering this review after owning the Galaxy S10E for about 1 year.I got this phone after I dropped my Moto X in water and I chose the Galaxy because I have a Galaxy watch and they two are supposed to work best together.I don't particularly have any complaints about the phone, it makes and receives calls. Runs the Android Apps that I find essential.It has reasonable storage.The Moto X have functions to turn on the flashlight (shake the phone) and camera (twist the phone) that I still missIn fact, when I DO need the flashlight, I find it very cumbersome to turn on as it is a button on the pull-down settings menu.THe Galaxy has a power share function so I should be able to charge my Galaxy watch from the phone.This does work, however, you have to lay the watch on the BACK of the phone - perfectly centered and STILL.I've had the phone in an Otterbox case the whole time I've had it and when I did need this powershare function, I had to take the phone out of the case.The screen got scratched all to pieces the one time I tried to do this - when I went on a short trip and forgot my watch charger.So, I wouldn't recommend using that function unless you can closely control the environment and ensure the phone doesn't get bumped and is laying on a soft and very clean surface.It is a small phone - I don't have complaints about the screen per se, but when I hold it out of the case I feel like it might slip through my hands easily.I have dropped it a number of times - in that Otterbox case - and it has never cracked or failed in any way.I've mentioned the case a couple of times so I do want to make a disclaimer - I won't buy another Otter Box case - it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty and the corner of it is broken off...I did say that I've dropped the phone, but that corner fell off at the strangest time - in fact, I got into my car and there was a piece of blue plastic lying on my black seat after looking all around, I realized it had come off my phone case. When I contacted the manufacturer they asked me to pay them $6 or $8 to ship a new one.That doesn't seem like much of a warranty to me.Regarding the interaction with the Galaxy watch:The Wear app doesn't do much.It will help you find the watch if it's lost in the house. Mostly it offers you about a million different watch faces - there's a whole section of the app dedicated to the watch face.As far as functionality, it's very hard to find apps for the watch thru that app.",2020年10月12日 在美国审核

Returning this to Samsung,"I purchased this unlocked directly from Samsung.I had this phone for about a week and the transfer and setup process using the Samsung Switch app was so bad that most of my apps didn't get downloaded. Instead there is an app icon that launches a web browser. Seriously Samsung, this is pretty basic stuff.The software also doesn't transfer account information and app specific settings unless you're transferring from another Samsung device. Not a good strategy to get customers from other manufacturers to switch to their products.The fingerprint reader is terrible and it sometimes it takes 5 - 6 tries to get it to work.Pictures are blurry.Lots of Samsung bloatware loaded on the phone constantly asking you to login to your Samsung account.Sending this back to Samsung and will be looking at other phones. Maybe a OnePlus 8T which is comparable, but comes with more storage and memory - 256Gb and 12Gb RAM.",2020年10月28日 在美国审核
"I really like this phone, with one exception","I really like this phone. It has great clarity, speed and good quality cameras. The only thing I don't like is that it does not have an LED notification of emails, texts or calls.I know this is a bit trivial, but it is something I really miss and wish this new F20 fe 5g had. I've seen some apps that provide this notification, but they require very intrusive information gathering requirements, which I don't want either.....The trusted places feature on my old s6 rarely worked, and the same holds true on this new s20 fe, it rarely unlocks my phone automatically when I'm at my trusted place. On the plus side, the fingerprint feature never worked on my old s6, it seems to work about 95% of the time on the s20 fe.I have not tried the face recognition feature as of yet, so I can't comment on how well that works or doesn't. The battery life seems to be about 50% better then my old s6. I'm not a constant user of the phone like some are, so I can go two and half days between charges.This is a really nice phone and I'm glad I upgraded from my old s6, but I can't understand why they gave up the LED notification feature.",2020年12月5日 在美国审核
a lot of problems.,"This phone achieves two really good goals, it's an amazing phone and really good value for money. You get a lot of great features and specs that are usually found in more expensive phones for the budget price. It's fast, very smooth and responsive, great camera. The plastic back might not impress some but for me it's VERY acceptable sacrifice for the lower price, I use case anyway and it's better than having glass. You just can't get a better phone for this price.UPDATE: well, things went south fast. This phone seemed great first couple of weeks but then it started showing problems. The brightness ALWAYS acting up, even after disabling adaptive brightness, when I am in direct sunlight outside it DIMS and I can barely see. The phone freezes and gotten very slow. Also every software update seems to make it worse, mostly recent update (3/26/2021) caused several apps like weather app to glitch. It's just so much trouble.

And the finger print sensor might take two trys sometimes. The camera is amazing, the battery life is even better. Charge time is quick, I had a note 9 before this and I am very pleased.

This phone is not for the busy professional,"When you look at texts you have to push another prompt to be able to call the individual who texted you. Why not just push phone?Maybe not a big if you have time but if you need to make 3/4 calls in 5 10 minutes it is. The playback button is right next to the call back. If your in a hurry and busy that causes issues because, and maybe it's just me but sometimes I push the call back and have to hang up or talk to someone when I'm pinched for time. Another issue, that I had with my S10 when you push phone massages I keep getting texts massages. WTH! Only way I can get to my phone message is by restart which is more time intensive than the S10.The people who designed this have no idea how busy a professional can be between clients, customers.

Great phone but horrible warranty,"Phone has worked great for me. It is annoying how big it is but I am slowly getting used to it. I bought it for the large battery and it has worked out great for me. I only really have to charge it once a day unless I am watching videos then maybe twice. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because after 10 months of having it my power on/off button on the side fell out. I have not been ruff with the phone. I haven't dropped it in liquid(s) or on hard surfaces. It just fell out from normal use, phone calls, texts, and watching videos. So far samsung doesn't seem to helpful and it sounds like this is an issue with the phone model, along with the volume button falling out. Hopefully that doesn't happen for me soon. Samsung said that it isn't covered under the warranty and only software issues are covered under the warranty.

The fourth one is Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G, about 10 months, the WiFi cannot turn on. I went to a repair spot authorized by Samsung two times in a month, then they said they can’t fix it, need change the mainboard, no values for repairing. I have to contact Samsung.

"Buttons Fall Off, Samsung Customer Support Unhelpful","I purchased this phone from Amazon in November 2020.In most ways it's an excellent product.However after 6 months of routine use the POWER button fell out of the phone.I searched online and discovered this was a common problem, but I imagined it would be a simple repairI brought the phone to a Samsung Authorized Service Center which told me that:1) Loss of the POWER button was considered “cosmetic” damage by Samsung and would not be covered under the 1 year warranty2) The POWER button is integrated with the display and cannot be replaced independently.So in order to fix the button I would have to pay for a new screen.I phoned Samsung customer service and they repeated the same explanation, but offered that I had the option of bringing the phone to a Samsung owned service center (a 90 minute drive each way) where they would inspect the phone and if the loss of the button was deemed a manufacturing problem then the replacement would be free.Otherwise I would have face the same charge for screen replacement and I would have wasted half a day getting there and back.It's extremely disappointing that the only frequently used moving parts on this otherwise fine product are engineered with such flimsy plastic.It's extremely disappointing that Samsung does not accept any responsibility for the design problem.Any customers who buy the phone based on its otherwise good performance and value should exercise great care when pressing the POWER and VOLUME buttons to avoid unwelcome repair expense.",2021年6月21日 在美国审核

(4) I had to turn off Auto Captitalize because it was capitalizing 3 or 4 words in the middle of every sentence. (5) It repeats text! Once it repeated 3 lines of text 15 times. (6) The cursor is not stationary. It jumps up and types in the middle of a prior sentence. Or if editing somewhere, the cursor jumps down and starts typing in the middle of another sentence. (7) I have problems with the simple task of copying and pasting! Won't work sometimes unless I type 1 letter 1st, then the Copy option will appear. And, in reverse, many times I get no Paste option unless I type in 1 letter 1st. (8) It is always inserting multiple words I didn't even say that I have to erase.(9) WORST, is their Contacts app. Yellow head,white shoulders and an orange background.

Follows the worst iPhone trends,"First things first:it has no headphone jack.Every phone should have a headphone jack.Leaving this out was an extremely stupid decision when Apple made it, and an even dumber one when Samsung followed their lead.If you're going to use a phone in public (as most cellphone users do sometimes!), it's a pretty basic piece of functionality to be able to do that without disturbing those around you.The official line is that leaving it out left room for a bigger battery, but there's a huge amount of space taken up by the multiple cameras.Leaving one of those off would have left enough room to include a jack.The description says it ""charges in minutes"", and technically that's true; 200 is a number of minutes.My S8 Active that the back has almost fallen off charges faster.It's at least easy to set the side button to do something useful now, instead of summoning Bixby; that saves it from a 1-star review.But Bixby is still there, trying to insert itself into tasks that Google's own tools are already doing better.",2021年9月1日 在美国审核

Terrible glass,"The phone itself is pretty good, but the glass they use on it is terrible. Try to find what they use, good luck. Corning doesn't list this model as using their glass.

Cheapest replacement glass, no listed version of what they use, and it breaks after a laughably minor fall = bad glass. Do not buy this phone.

Overall it Delivers!  If you are ok with screen,"i had the following questions:1. would it really be new out of the box?2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?The answers:1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal.Flawless condition2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera.With these in mind, the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution), the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness.The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen.i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness.But that means much less battery life.3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediatelyConclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp, less bright screen, and mid range camera.You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.If you are ok with these trade offs, this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised.",2021年6月12日 在美国审核

Also T-Mobile’s new 5G home internet can use 4G Lite bands for large movie streaming users.My 4G phone internet has slowed down on T-Mobile. Need to upgrade my other phone to 5G.

Best Midrange phone,"This phone is a lot better than expected. Coming from the s10+, I was worried that I would be completely disappointed. The s20fe feels premium despite having a plastic back. This is due to its thickness and weight. The plastic feels premium and the cloud mint doesn't leave visible fingerprints. The phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865; the phone feels very smooth. The 120hz refresh rate also adds to the smoothness of the experience. 6gb of ram is sufficient for the vast majority of users. My s10+ plus had 8gb and I felt like I could have an endless amount of apps open. The same could be said with this phone. The cameras are quite good but I'd recommend testing out the phone in person. Yes... the 1080p display looks fine. You will not be able to tell the difference unless you get a magnifying glass or put your eye right up to the display. If you are coming from the s8 or and older phone, this phone is worth picking up.*Update, I'm really satisfied with the performance of the phone. Battery life with the 120hz screen is acceptable and can still last the whole day with moderate use. The rear camera is nice but the front facing camera leaves more to be desired. The performance is definitely there with the Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of ram. I used to use a phone with 8gb of ram and I don't notice a difference (I always have multiple apps open). My original opinion still stands. There have also been reports of touchscreen issues. This has not affected me. Samsung sent out an update to correct this issue for those who had it.Second Update (March 18th 2021) Nothing much to add about the phone. My original opinion still stands. The fingerprint scanner can be a pain sometimes but works the majority of the time. Samsung has been doing a good job updating this phone too. I just wish this phone had a headphones jack (at least it has expandable storage).",2020年10月6日 在美国审核

But after I restarted the network I am now on 5G.I did not receive my headset. I reached out to Amazon and I'll see what they say. If not I'll reach out to Samsung. This phone is larger than my S9 but I love the screen size even though it's not easy to hold for me with one hand. It is a beautiful phone. Screen has amazing color. And it is quite fast. Downer is the battery life. I've been on it for a couple hours and I'm down to 62% but it did charge really fast. From what I did see of the camera in low light the picture did come out nice for being at night. 3 different settings are on upon opening it. Zoom back, regular and zoom in. I'll see what the pictures look like in the day. Overall I'm happy with my purchase. Just hope that the battery life gets fixed. It's a nice alternative for getting a new phone at a not so large price tag.",2020年10月4日 在美国审核

No Regrets,"I previously used the A71 4G (international version) and loved that phone. However, it had severe signal problems after I moved to a new area, so I started looking for a US version 5G phone. I was considering the A71 5G or the new A52, but I couldn't find one unlocked that would arrive quickly enough. Then I remembered this phone and boom...exactly what I needed, and for just a bit more money than the A52. I don't absolutely need flagship specs, but I must say that I'm enjoying the upgrade from my A71. Everything works flawlessly and fast. Camera is excellent. I do miss the headphone jack, but I got an adapter that works fine. If you're buying unlocked, I think this is a better deal than a new A-series Galaxy!",2021年7月16日 在美国审核

Doesn't seem brand new,I just want to say the battery life is pretty bad for the size of the battery and it seemed like I didn't get a brand new phone. My package came with no plastic wrap around it.

"Tough, durable, awesome phone!","First off, love this phone. Works great for all my needs, and other reviews cover that well.Now the important thing for me- 3 weeks after putting this phone in service, I left it on the roof of my car. After retracing my drive home, I found it in the middle of a 4 lane road by constantly calling it as we drove along the shoulder of the road. Obviously it had been ran over multiple times during the hour and a half it sat there, but the ringing led us straight to it. The only damage was a shattered Supershieldz screen protector and scuffed Otterbox Defender case- the phone is still in perfect condition. True testament to this phones durability, including the gurrilla glass- I still can't believe I'm typing this review on the same phone that was run over multiple times and still laying in the middle of a lane a few short hours ago.Way to Samsung- you have a customer for life!",2021年5月19日 在美国审核

A flagship phone without the flagship price,"I have had the phone for about two weeks. After waiting on TCL 10l 5G, Oneplus Nord (that didn't launch state side)_, and Google Pixel 4a 5G/Pixel 5 I had to jump on on this phone. I was able to get the phone for $100 less then Pixel 5 with a stronger processor by preordering the phone. Another plus is I also got a $70 Samsung gift card for preordering the phone. This is my 3rd Samsung phone since the S3. Sadly their phone were getting too expensive with only two years worth of updates.<br>The Positive: The phone comes with the latest flagship processor,120 hz display, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos, and at least 3 years of updates. It comes with fast wireless charge, power share, the underside doesn't feel cheap, and battery last me the whole day between work and playing games. ""The 1st thing that came to mind when I turned the phone on was how I have been missing out on how beautiful Samsung's amoled screens are on.""The bad: It comes with gorilla glass 3 I would invest in a screen protector. Thephone doesn't come with a 25w super fast charger I guess to keep the cost and it is missing a USB c to c cable to transfer data. (the 15W fast charger it comes with takes about 1hr 30 mins to fully charge my phone while the $12 super charge I bought of Amazon takes exactly 1 hr to charge my phone to 100%Another negative for me is Samsung UI which will delay Android 11. My second thought after 1 hour was ""I don't miss Samsung horrible UI and I would prefer a more vanilla android experience.""I really shouldn't have to use a second launcher like Nova to customize my phone.Overall: This phone is feature proof with 5G (won't be viable for another 3 years) and 3 yearsworth of updates. I am very excited about the phone and look forward to Samsung releasing more affordable phones with flagship specs in future. Definitely a better value then any other phone on the market if you can live with Samsung UI.Oddity with 5G not the phones fault: I have tested 5G and 4G on T-Mobile network and for some odd reason I get half the speed 4G gives me. (5G is definitely still in its infant stage and don't expect any real speed differences to come until 2022 with 2025 being reality.)</br>",2020年10月16日 在美国审核

Loving it so far,"I was waiting for the Pixel 5 which came out the same time. The 5 was $100 more ($699) than Amazon's price of S20 FE of $599 at release (*S20 FE now $699) with the 5 using processing power of a few generations back with smaller battery capacity - this was a no brainer choice and Google over priced their flagship (I understand their camera is generally good and updates faster/ui cleaner - but that's not making up for everything else especially considering competition from this phone and OnePlus among others).It's still brand new so time will tell a lot more but the phone is snappy and my wifi &amp; cell signal are faster than my Honor View 10 that's being replaced. I use T-mobile and not in a 5G area yet (but one is close by I'll be able to test). I attached a pic of my speed test info on cell network. The bottom 2 similar results are default with 5G enabled in the cellular settings and the top (fastest) results is with the second option of 4G LTE/3/2 enabled. I thankfully read a post to disable 5G if not in network for one. My old phone would only get 25 download on average so the S20 FE has blown that away even at its worst.I took a photo in an average edge lit room of some colored items and a pic in a very low light room (any light coming in is from a room at least 10ft away). I'm blown away by the low light pic - I can't explain how well lit the pic is compared to what my eyes perceive.The first day I spent my time uninstalling and disabling whatever I could that was pre-installed by Samsung and tweaked shortcuts &amp; and new to me (Samsung specific) features I wanted. I used the recommended Smart Switch to transfer files from my old phone (namely apps, selected pics, and texts &amp; call records) and I used my saved backup from my launcher (Nova) to bring back the app/screen organization I had customized on my old phone. Now I get to enjoy.It does charge fast and no problems connecting to 2 different Bluetooth headsets.*Update* I realized my original download speed pic was clipped wrong (showed a 2G wifi download speed instead of LTE) so I removed the old and uploaded correct pic (speed increase still stands).I placed prices in as they've changed since I purchased.You can choose to bring your screen refresh to 60 to help extend battery (defaults at 120 - I recommend scrolling feeds and testing both out in other scenarios to see if it's worth it for you). As always, to extend battery on any phone, control background apps and their access, lower your screen brightness when able and keep GPS, wifi, Bluetooth off when not needed. If your phone has bad reception in an area you spend a prolonged period of time in and you don't need to call/text, put your phone in airplane mode and turn wifi on after (if wifi available/needed).",2020年10月11日 在美国审核

When the battery dies, I just plugged them in and go. No more! Funny the literature promotion for this phone didn't include this downgrade. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition features because they are unreliable. The display is so responsive to touch that the phone wanders all over the internet while in my pocket despite all attempts to make it not do that in the settings.

Trash more trash,"So I got this phone around 12pm, activated it with tmobile around 2. Got a screen and case for the thing.

Fortunately for these folks I already did to much to the phone to want to go that far to return. however I would of returned based on the face I just spent from 4pm to now at 8pm trying to successfully update my phone. This is my SECOND S20FE and im very technology savvy. For I use to work for Apple, but I prefer galaxy all the way. But why do I have a brand new phone and I have to to through articles hard resets, updating over and over again just for it to tell me its not updated again! Well finally at 8pm and me not giving up not wanting to have to return the phone I finally was able to successfully update the phone. I called Amazon HELP and they hung up on me. All the way I want to give the phone amazon and SAMSUNG 2 STARS 1 star because I still love galaxy and the other star for my self I guess cause no help from amazon or samsung I fixed it myself. Oh and im also very upset that u locked samsung phones don't have the read receipt feature have to download messages and that even took me another half hour reading articles and discovered on the forum I had to download the carrier services app to even be able to use messages chat features. Even though it says my phone should be compatible to use at this point im just tired....I'll end up buying another phone down the line but right now I don't have time and I guess ill just be grateful for the time being.... will NEVER order from samsung again I guess to get all features you have to be a SLAVE to a carrier!!!",2021年3月26日 在美国审核

Muy buen telefono,"Tengo prácticamente una semana con el equipo y no me arrepiento de nada, vengo de un galaxy s8+ y el salto es muy bueno, quería un s20+ pero después de tantos videos de análisis que ví me decidí por este s20 fe ya que no le pide nada al plus, solo el tema de que la parte de atrás es de plástico pero seamos sinceros la mayoría lo ocupará con funda así que estarás poco en contacto con esa parte. Voy por partes:Tiene: carga inalámbrica, carga reversible, snapdragon 865, resistente al agua y polvo, 6 de ram, 128 de almacenamiento, tasa de refresco 120, pantalla Amoled, batería 4500 mha, Cargador ""mexicano"" pero de 15w yo te recomiendo que compres uno de 25w cuando hagas tu pedido para que tengas carga súper rápida ya que es lo que admite el teléfono, la entrada es USB c, trae pinchito, admite tarjeta SD, solo un SIM, si se puede usar en México sin problema yo lo ocupo con Telcel sin problema.No tiene: pantalla curva que en mi caso agradezco ya que algunas áreas en las pantallas curvas son difíciles de alcanzar, me pasaba mucho con mi s8+, no trae funda por lo que recomiendo que compres una al mismo tiempo que hagas tu pedido del celular para que cuando te llegue tu equipo puedas usarlo con su funda y estés más seguro . No tiene entrada de audífonos 3.5 por lo que si no tienes audifonos Bluetooth vayas pensando en comprar uno o comprar un adaptador, para mí no es ningún problema ya que los audífonos no los ocupo casi.Envío: me tardo en llegar una semana prácticamente pero todo dentro de los días que me marcó desde el inicio la fecha de llegada, pudo haber llegado antes pero en mi caso DHL no llega directo a mi ciudad si no que hace reconexión, pero todo eso está contemplado en la fecha de llegada así que todo bien. La caja llegó en buenas condiciones y toda sellada nada abierta solo un poquito arrugadita de una esquina pero se entiende por el manejo de la mensajería, nada agrave prácticamente imperceptible.Pago: pague lo que marca el precio en el anuncio, no tuve que pagar nada más ya que parece que los gastos de manejo vienen incluído en el precio anunciado, en México sin ser 5g y sin el procesador snapdragon el teléfono está en unos 16 mil y lo que pague que fueron $13,200 es un súper precio considerando que es 5g y trae el snapdragon.Rendimiento: lo he usado con los 120 hzs y me ha durado todo el día la batería, llegó con un 20% a las 9 pm. Creo que es un rendimiento bueno pero no el mejor considerando que juego prácticamente nada al día, mi mayor uso son las redes sociales, correo y aplicaciones del trabajo pero las ocupo mucho que compensa esa parte del juego así que no creo tengas problema para terminar tu día con algo de batería y si no una cargadita de 20 minutos y listo. El rendimiento ha sido de unas 7.5 horas de pantalla encendida.Cámaras: si considero que venía de un s8+ el salto ha sido muy grande, las cámaras tienen muy buena calidad y nada que envidiar al s20+ si no me crees ve los videos de reseas y verás que no hay mucha diferencia por lo mucho más que pagas en el plus creo que el FE tiene mejor calidad precio.En resumen es un buen telefono, me gusta mucho el módulo de cámaras, el color que elegí fue el azul y me agradó mucho, se siente como un premium y luce como un premium, yo pensaba en darle una oportunidad a un Xiaomi, realme, poco etc pero seamos sinceros Samsung es Samsung y si trae un snapdragon es mucho mejor, estoy seguro que los Specs suenan fabulosos en otras marcas pero no creo que su calidad de equipo aguante el pasar de los aos, yo uso los teléfonos un promedio de 3 aos, siempre Samsung y los he dejado prácticamente como nuevos. Así que si quieres un teléfono bueno, bonito y que te dure unos aos este es tu opción ideal, no te vas arrepentir.",2020年12月2日 在墨西哥审核

Mucho mejor que la serie 20 que tiene Exynos,"Hace unos meses compré el S20 plus con exynos y debo decir que ese celular es una basura. La batería le duraba 8 horas en uso normal!

"Es un buen equipo con base a costo beneficio. Sin embargo, su rendimiento me quedo debiendo.","Hace 5 días me llego mi Samsung Galaxy S20 Fe 5G Cloud Navy. Me quede impresionado ya que llego antes de lo esperado.Llego el equipo en buenas condiciones y totalmente sellado, con su cargador y su cable.Decidí comprar este producto liberado ya que según tengo entendido viene con la versión de Snapdragon. Al venir de un celular de huawei (y al no tener acceso a las aplicaciones de Google) opte por comprar un Samsung de tal manera que ya habia tenido Galaxy S3 hace bastantes aos. Estoy fascinado con su pantallas amoled (característico de Samsung) su calidad de imagen y video, sin olvidar su fluidez ya que cuenta con 120hz (ajustable a 60hz). Me encuentro satisfecho con la compra, sin embargo, el unico ""pero"" que le pongo es... He leído otros comentarios que hablan de un ""buen rendimiento'' y sinceramente por horario de trabajo le he dado un uso básico, visitas a redes sociales espontáneas durante el día. Siendo ya la 5 pm tengo menos de un 55% de bateria tomando en cuenta que casi no lo uso en horario de trabajo. Mi experiencia con Samsung siempre su batería es mala y alargo plazo tiendes a fallar mucho sus baterías (experiencia a equipos anteriores). Quisiera saber si alguien más le ha pasado?

La caja venía abierta y sin hoja de garantía.,"El celular no defrauda realmente, cumple con todas tus espectativas es muy potente y eficiente, se siente el poder de su procesador snapdragon 865 y la eficiencia de la batería es formidable te dura todo 1 jornada laboral de 8 horas sin ningún problema llegas a tu casa fácilmente con el 30 a 35% de batería con un uso frecuente del dispositivo durante el día. te permite saltar de aplicacion en aplicacion rápidamente y navegar por ellas sin qué el dispositivo se alente en ningún momento, se calienta muy poco a excepción de los juegos ahí suele subir considerablemente su temperatura pero no es de una manera exagerada. Las cámaras son excelentes y cuentan con una resolución e interpretación de colores muy balanceados y el modo noche es una maravilla las fotos en cuartos muy oscuros las saca tan claras como si fuera de día.<br>Pero como dije el celular no decepciona el qué decepciona es el estado en el qué lo envían, ya que desde que habres la caja te das cuenta que no protegen de movimientos o golpes bruscos a la caja del dispositivo qué viene dentro y va totalmente suelto. De ahí una vez qué sacas tu articulo te das cuenta que ya ha sido habierto ya que la caja dónde viene el celular no traía los sellos oficles de Samsung, si no más bien un sello común y corriente que puedes conseguir en una papelería, una vez que rompes dichos sellos y abres la caja para ver tu celular y revisas los documentos que suelen traer un celular ""nuevo"" te das cuenta qué la garantía del dispositivo no viene dentro, reafirmando una vez más que la caja fue abierta antes. Después de 20 días de uso del celular el botón de BLOQUEO/ENCENDIDO, se comienzaaflojar y se termina cayendo dejando al botón incerbible. y sin la hoja de garantía dentro de la caja te ponen en un grave predicamento ya que no puedes exigirle una garantía a Samsung porque no cuentas con la hoja. afortunadamente ésto me sucedió antes de cumplirse el mes de oportunidad que te da Amazon para regresarlo y pude devolver el equipó pidiendo mi reembolso, pero si esto hubiera pasado después del mes y sin la hoja de la garantía del celular hubiera tirado 14 mil pesos a la basura. Revisen bien como llega el celular y chequen si su articulo lleva la garantía y si no es así usen y pongan aprueba su celular de manera intesa para detectar los defectos rápidamente y estén a tiempo de pedir el reembolso de su dinero.</br>",2021年8月17日 在墨西哥审核
