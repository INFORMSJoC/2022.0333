"Honestly, it was worth it","I was very hesitant about buying an iPhone off of Amazon, but I did it and was not disappointed. It came with 100% battery life, so it basically was brand new. It came with a charger and cube (plug), but that's it. Sorry to disappoint those who into that airpod life.No scratches and shipped fairly quickly. The only complaint I have for the iPhone XS, in general, is that I really liked the fingerprint scan, sometimes the face recognition doesn't work when you're looking down. But what it lacks in that feature, the iPhone delivers in the portrait camera mode, I seriously am in love with the blur feature.Sincerely,A very satisfied Amazon customer",2019年6月22日 在美国审核
"Beautiful, lovely, practically brand new iPhone XS!","I absolutely love my new iPhone XS! It arrived on time and practically brand new. The battery health is at 95% so it’s practically a brand new battery in here. It’s a very beautiful looking phone and is very responsive especially with the face recognition. That works very well even in low light settings, or if you have sunglasses and a hat on. I was surprised at how accurate that was. The battery lasts all day easily and I’ve hardly had any issues with apps crashing or anything like that.The phone itself was flawless and came with a protective film over it. There’s no scratches or signs of wear or anything to be found on the phone which I thought was great especially since it is an Amazon renewed item!I would definitely recommend this for anybody that is looking to upgrade their phone. The one I got is fully unlocked to GSM and CDMA networks so you can use it for any cell phone provider as long as you have a SIM card which it does not come with. It does come with a SIM tool as well as a generic charger and short cable which I just have tucked away as spares.",2020年2月4日 在美国审核

NOT LEGIT IPHONE. CHEAP KNOCKOFF According to Apple Store,"To my dismay, my phone started getting VERY hot for no reason, then my screen started going out. I took it to Apple and they asked me ""Where did you get this fixed?"". I was confused. They said that BOTH the SCREEN and BATTERY were NOT APPLE, and instead were cheap replacement parts, and that they wouldn't service it. I'm not out $500 that I paid for a cheap knockoff. I suspected this might be the case because the screen was... bland, and the XS is supposed to have a magnificent ""OLED"" screen.This is 3.5 months after purchase.Pros: It did come with a nice screen protector on it. It also worked with my ATT sim card.I don't know if this is an Amazon wide problem, or if it's just this seller, but I feel like I've been scammed. All I know is I paid for something and got a cheap knockoff that died. I'm actually a law student and you can bet as soon as I pass the bar, I'm filing an ""implied warranty"" suit out of principal; look it up if you've ever been told something is ""out of warranty"" but feel like it was 'supposed' to last at least that long.",2020年7月16日 在美国审核

Love the iPhone XS,"My husband has a bad habit of dropping his phone. He’s broken so many androids. Finally got him the iPhone XS and a case. Has dropped it many times and it’s still kicking. Over 6 months and still holding up!<br>iPhones have a great reputation for being tough.My son has had androids for years. I would always get him the cheapest ones because he would constantly break them. Case or no case. I finally upgraded my iPhone 5S to an iPhone XS and passed my old one to him and it lasted for 2 years. iPhone 5S is no longer compatible with our cell company so I had to upgrade his phone. I got him an iPhone XS as well (wasn’t giving up mine).First day I got my iPhone XS, we went to the water park. I didn’t want to leave it in the car or on the side lines, so I tried being careful as I carried it with me in the pool (stupid, I know). It fell in and was at the 4 foot depth for about 30 seconds before I could pull it out. No case. Still works great!We all have the 256gb size and none of us have used more than 60gb yet. I’ve had mine for 3 1/2 years, my son has had his for almost 2 years and my husband has had his for 6 months.</br>",2021年6月7日 在美国审核

Overall Very Happy With My Purchase from buySPRY,"I was skeptical about this at first, but I’m glad I bought the phone in the end. I read a lot of reviews that said the phone didn’t work or had varying things wrong with it, but I think most people go into this expecting a new phone with no damage whatsoever to the outside. However, if you read the product description carefully, it’ll tell you everything you need to know. I got lucky because there are no scratches or dents anywhere on the phone I received, but even if there had been some, I don’t think I would care. You’re paying $400 for a flagship phone, so expecting some minimal cosmetic damage is not a bad idea.I love this phone. Face recognition works great, the screen is vibrant and I can see a stark contrast in the colors when compared to my old iPhone 7+. I was hoping to get a newer battery, but I only got 83%. However, I don’t have an issue with that, because worst case scenario, I get the battery replaced for $70 at the Apple store, and I’m still paying less for this phone than I would pay for a new Xs or other newer iPhone.Overall, I can really only speak for buySPRY, but I really recommend buying from them. It’s a great phone, and I plan on having it for a long time.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核
Battery not 100%,"I’m content with what I got, but I think it should be more obvious that Amazon’s definition of refurbished is not the same as Apple’s definition. This item came with a battery at 88% of max capacity. I asked the vendor about their policy toward batteries in refurbished iPhone and they stated anything greater than 80% of max capacity is within Amazon’s guidelines.I am content with that for an iPhone XS 256gb at the $567 price point. I see the 256 GB model is now up to $599 which makes the battery comprise just a bit harder to swallow.The XS is a huge upgrade from my 7 and my wife’s 8 Plus. It was worth the price.

They even provided the necessary tool to change sim-cards from phone to phone, which was useful.

After some sorting, though, I have no regrets whatsoever.The capability of this phone, despite it being one model year old, is striking (Many of its features are superior even to the current iPhone 11, including the OLED screen).The battery life has been better than expected for a renewed device, likely because it is only one model year old.I have larger hands, but I prefer the 5.8 inch size for one-handed use.If you are looking for a foray into the Apple ecosphere, this opportunity is hard to beat.",2020年1月2日 在美国审核

Amazing! Perfect condition!,"Screen is amazing. Had to have OLED.

I was really really happy it was in such great condition. 89% battery.I hate that I love apple so much now. I had a Mac as a kid and kinda forgot how beautiful their OS and build quality is. But damn the cult of Mac entry fee is intimidating. And tbh it doesn’t replace windows for everything. But I’m slowly but surely going to own the entire ecosystem. And felt like and iPhone 7 wasn’t going to cut it. I’m really grateful my bf let me buy this.

Great quality and price,"Really nice quality. If you’re looking for a basically new phone, but don’t need the latest and greatest model, don’t hesitate to get this as it’s well worth the price. The phone looks almost new upon arrival, there were only very small scuffs on the edge of the screen. They were too small for me to even consider them scratches. And once I put a screen protector on, I don’t even see them. Obviously, if you want an absolutely perfect phone, maybe this isn’t for you. The battery health was at 92% when it arrived; I’m upgrading from an iPhone 6, so both the battery life and phone overall are a huge upgrade. If you’re new to buying a phone on Amazon like I was, I can confirm that the fully unlocked version of this phone does work with a Verizon SIM (I was a bit worried about that, the whole CDMA vs GSM thing goes well over my head). Anyway, overall really happy with this purchase thus far, I’ll update this review if anything happens.",2021年5月30日 在美国审核

I was reinsured that it will work with Sprint CDMA network since is fully unlocked. When I received the phone, read included instructions there was a part in the bottom stating that this device is only compatible with GSM network for T MOBILE and ATT. Went step further and verified using devices sn# on network provider’s website and came back with the same massage stating this device is NOT compatible.Make the story short, it took a call to network provider customer service, explain the story that this is fully unlocked phone and pleading that it should work.

Buying Renewed--Totally Worth It!,"I bought this phone back in December of 2019 and intentionally waited a few months to write a review to see how the phone behaved over time.Before buying the renewed iPhone XS off of Amazon, I had only bought brand new apple products from the Apple store. I would have never considered using an alternative site, until Apple raised it's prices on Apple Care. I have needed repairs on most of my Apple Products due to dropping my devices. I have no hate for Apple, but charging $250 for Apple care on phones is just not an option for me.I took a leap of faith and bought this version from Amazon. My XS came in the mail a few days later than expected (originally giving me the ""oh-crap-I-just-got-scammed"" feeling). Besides a few smudges which came off with some rubbing alcohol and the world's tiniest scratch--keep in mind, the renewed iPhones on amazon have to look like new from an arm's length away-- this phone is perfect.I genuinely have 0 complaints. The phone's battery has been consistent, I charge it for about 2-3 hours every 24-36 hours if I'm using the phone heavily throughout the day, and every 48 if not. It works flawlessly--it hasn't crashed, given me error messages, or refused to update (I've heard some horror stories about refurbished phones). Best of all, Amazon offers their own version of repair care for only $88.99 (comparable to Apple's old policy).Overall, if you're like me and you don't need the latest version of smartphones, but know you need an accident protection plan, then just get the Amazon renewed iPhones. It will save you hundreds of dollars and is absolutely worth it!",2020年4月5日 在美国审核

"Works Great, Good Value","Worked flawlessly after charging. I thought it would come with some battery life so I had a mini heart attack when it didn’t turn on but once charged everything worked great and I transitioned everything from my old phone with no problems. I upgraded from the X because I had a messed up screen and the battery life sucked. So far the battery life on the xs seems to be slightly better which is okay given that it’s basically the same exact model as the X internally. The only thing I’ve had come up is that the flashlight seems to be a slightly cooler tone and dimmer than before? It could be a trick of the mind, maybe I had a dirty flashlight before, or it has to do with it being refurbished but it just feels a little different than the one on the X I had. Not a big issue just something I noticed.

Good deal at this price.,"Reasonable delivery time:ordered on 1/4, delivered on 1/9.Phone received in excellent condition.No case scratches, scuffs, or dings.Screen had one very small, very light swirl scuff that isn’t noticeable unless held in a certain position with the device turned off.When device is on and screen is displaying the scuff is not visible.Should also note that the scuff totally disappeared when I placed the tempered glass screen protector on the unit.Most importantly, phone is fully functional.Phone received with an indicated battery life of 87% maximum capacity, which I find acceptable for a “refreshed” phone.Considering a “refurbished” unit from Apple’s site was considerably more than this unit’s cost, I think this phone was a good deal.Also, the fact that this purchase falls under the Amazon Renewed Guarantee (check it out) provided me with enough confidence to take a chance on buying a renewed product from Amazon.This phone was an upgrade for me from an iPhone 6, and after using the content transfer process to get the iPhone 6 content to the new phone, simply taking the micro-SIM chip out of the iPhone 6 and installing it in the iPhone XS completed upgrade process since I was staying with Verizon.This worked flawlessly and I was immediately using the new phone with the content exactly as it was on the old phone.Bottom line:This purchase of an Amazon Renewed iPhone worked out well for me.I would consider going this route again for a phone and/or other items I might need.Also, I would purchase again from the CellCow vendor as they delivered the product as advertised.",2020年2月3日 在美国审核

The phone was exactly as listed, the only issue I had was the 87% battery capacity and the ear piece speaker. But once I gave the phone a good clean with alcohol and cotton swabs, it was legit LOUDER than my 2 year old 11 pro max.

Other than that the phone was 256 GB, and the color matched, it even came with a free screen protector, but unfortunately I never use cases or screen protectors. But I could see that as an advantage because the screen did have a handful of scratches. But it’s not a dealbreaker. Ever had to give the phone he waiting I’ll give it is solid 7/10.

Absolutely Flawless,"Arrived a day early and in flawless condition. It even had tempered glass screen protector on it. Battery condition is 100%, all features work as new, you wouldn't be able to look at this phone vs. a new phone from the factory and tell a difference.

"Great Battery Life, Brilliant Display, Great Camera","I bought this phone mainly for work. The battery lasts throughout the workday while I'm making calls, browsing the web, and managing social media accounts.I upgraded from an iPhone 7+ and the XS has a larger screen, but the phone itself is smaller and easier to use with one hand. After getting used to the lack of a home button, I've also noticed that I can do the same operations faster than before.The camera quality is great, especially in portrait mode. It really accentuates the details, and the built-in editor makes it easy to quickly edit and post photos.The video quality is also great for a phone. It's more than capable of shooting short films in 4k or 1080p (although it would help to have accessories).Finally, I love the seamless integration of Apple products. I can easily work on a project by going back and forth between my MacBook Pro and iPhone, and when I'm on the go and don't feel like taking my phone everywhere, I can simply wear my apple watch and keep up with notifications and stay in touch with friends and family.",2020年5月21日 在美国审核
PERFECT! Just like new!!,"I was a little leery of buying a used iPhone off Amazon however I am so glad that I did! My XS arrived just as described, and looks brand new. It took me a little while to set up (user error) - and now it is working great. I simploy popped the SIM card out of my 8 and put into my new phone. I had looked at an iPhone 11 as well however when comparing the 11 and XS features, the two are almost identical other than the 11 being more expensive. I was able to get 256G for the same price I would 64g had I bought elsewhere. I wish prime shipping had been available but product did arrive when expected.

According to the box, the battery capacity was 90%, but when I opened the phone it was only 88%.

A Great Value on a Used Phone in Excellent Condition,"I admit I was a bit anxious about buying a used cellphone because there are so many ways for it to turn out bad, but I am happy to say my fears were not realized. In fact the phone arrived earlier than Amazon predicted and the condition of the phone was better than promised. There are no marks or scratches on the device except for a couple of very faint scratches on the front screen that I can only see in bright lighting, at the right angle and from very close range. At arms length it looks brand new, and with a glass screen protector installed I can't see those faint scratches at all. Everything works perfectly and the battery condition is 100% which is amazing for a used phone. It may be two years old but for just one third the price of new this iPhone XS is a great deal.",2021年3月2日 在美国审核
Overall happy but didn't match the discription,"Read this if your ear speaker is buzzingI doubt they are looking over these phones like they say they are. Got the XS and everything is working great but the ear speaker sounded blown out. When a speaker sounds like that usually it means you would need a replacement, but most of the time with the X and XS it's just lodged with dirt and needs to be cleaned out. (again the description says ""thoroughly cleaned"" and that they test and replace defective parts... doubt it.) I really didn't feel like going through a return process and since that was the only thing seemingly wrong I just loosened up the dirt with a soft brush and a q-tip and used scotch tape to grab up the loose dirt. My speaker now sounds normal and I didn't have to wait and risk getting another phone that had other issues.Other than that it works perfect. Battery was as described. Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would probably go through them again in the future. I'll update if there are any other issues.",2020年6月9日 在美国审核

The camera is AMAZING quality it takes really good picture. the selfie camera is so good and the flash doesnt give that weird black and white fuzzy thing my old phone did when i used flash in the dark.

Best Experience with a Renewed Phone,"I’ve had pretty bad luck with finding Renewed phones as my iPhone 6 battery died as soon as I got it in 2018 and my iPhone 7s battery went down significantly after a battery change. So I was looking for a worth while upgrade and found this phone and took a chance. It was the best chance I got. The only con is the battery life at 88% but that was to be expected since I bought it refurbished, and the screen only has very light scratches that you can’t see when the screens on. Otherwise, this is definitely a steal and worth the money. Don’t be scared of refurbished phones, only buy from the trusted sellers like Amazon.

Not a scratch on it.,"New to Iphones, previous galaxy guy.Whole family was on Iphones but me.The voice recognition ability of Siri is truly amazing compared to whateverSamsung is using (Bixby?).I hate typing texts, and like to speak them, and some of my previous ones on the old phone were either hilarious or embarrassing or both.I think Siri learns heuristically because I rarely have to proof read what I speak now.Being able to just say, ""Hey Siri, call whoever"" and have it happen is a big time-saver not having to look up the numbers.It's like having an assistant in the phone, but not having to fool with setting it up.You just speak to it.The phone itself appears new, not a scratch on it.Battery life is at 86%, but I haven't been able to use it up in a day, so that works for me.Learning how to navigate the phone is challenging, as many things sort of work like a Galaxy, but it can be frustrating.But overall, I glad I made the switch.",2020年6月2日 在美国审核

Boy was I pleasantly surprised. This phone looked like it was brand new. I can't find a scratch anywhere, front or back! And the battery health was 94%.

Good Phone Better Deal.,Don’t use face recognition but sure it probably works fine. I was most impressed with the battery life. Easily get a day out of it. Only thing I notice is when talking the connection gets garbled and sounds robotic. I don’t believe that is the phone however as the only times that happened have been when I was speaking to someone either on an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 5s. Also they were moving so it could be a reception issue. Giving it 5 stars cause I can’t prove there are any issues whatsoever with the phone and the price is unbeatable.,2021年6月1日 在美国审核

"Lots of scratches on screen, hidden by screen protector","Summary: Screen has a lot of scratches on it, otherwise OK.Long version:This product arrived with a screen protector already on it. Underneath the screen protector were two large scratches, visible from arms length when the screen was off or dim. As someone who prefers dark mode, this was a bit annoying. The product description says no scratches are visible at arms length, but this is either false or they mean when the screen is on bright.The screen protector was of poor quality: it collected fuzz and hair on the edges where the adhesive was exposed. When I removed the screen protector, I found that underneath it were many very fine scratches in addition to the previously mentioned deeper scratches.It appears that the seller uses screen protectors to hide the scratches on the screen.The device was shipped in a thin aftermarket box in a plastic padded envelope. I would have preferred that a fragile, glass front and back, electronic device would be worth enough to ship in a box with more adequate packing materials.On the plus side, the battery health is 97%, and the rest of the frame is in immaculate condition. No dust in the ports or speaker grille. No visible damage to waterproofing ring.Total, I rate this a 3/5: it's half the price of Apple Certified refurbished, but the damage to the screen is impossible to ignore. Next time I will spend more from a more reputable seller. For the amount I paid I don't feel like I got a good deal, but I also don't feel like I got a super bad deal. My purchase was through Amazon from a seller called BuySPRY.",2020年5月1日 在美国审核

Perfect condition,I had to get in and write an initial review so that anyone considering this phone for a gift would feel confident with their purchase. Anytime you see “renewed” you expect something less than new but your not sure how it will compare to new. Honestly in this case you would not know the difference. I was pleasantly surprised. I received this phone yesterday and it is perfect as if I just unboxed a new iPhone XS. The phone powered on and had 100% battery. I am so please with this phone. It also arrived 4 days ahead of the expected delivery date. Thank you CellCow.,2019年12月6日 在美国审核

Cheaply fixed phones,"READ BEFORE BUYINF.<br>When you buy a product like this, I hope you know that this is NOT what you would usually get at an Apple store. These products are hit or miss. I ordered an iPhone 8 last year and it looked new and it’s lasted me until now. But I wanted to switch it up and treat myself and buy the iPhone XS. With prime, shipping was great and only took 2 days. When I opened it up, the box looked like it has been ran over by a car. When I opened the box up, the phone looked fine to the eye, but as soon as I played music, it sounded like the speakers were being covered with how muffled they were. And that was without a case. When talking about the front facing camera, I’m pretty sure my old iPhone 4 has a better one.And it’s another thing to mention: in the fine print, the battery life says “they sell phones as long as they are above 80% battery life”. Mine was on 85% when I received it. Yes I wish it was higher but know that before you buy it that you MAY need to go and get a new battery inside your phone if you need it to be at 100%.LISTEN!!!Amazon Refurbished can be a great thing. They have tons of great, awesome phones. But they also have phones that are VERY cheaply made. Just be wary of that before buying.I hope this helps y’all before you buy!!</br>",2020年7月11日 在美国审核

Could have been better.. not a Woot! Woot experience,"I have to preface the review by saying that I was skeptical when making this purchase because of the mixed reviews. But I did my due diligence on different sellers selling renewed devices andchose Woot as the seller. I had good experience with Woot when I directly purchased from them in the past.Amazon Renewed Guarantee provide additional reassurance if something did not go well. (but there's always a catch.. more on that at the end).Product Delivery/Packaging: Very poor1. The product was not eligible for prime for some reason.2. The delivery took more than week but was delivered as committed.3. The phone was packed in Bubble Envelope ...not an Iphone box or any box but just yellow bubble envelope.4. The phone was wrapped in foam cover and then bubble wrap (see picture). Was really surprised the phone survived the transit. Kudos to UPS who handled this with such carePhone and Accessories: Average1. Phone itself was wrapped up in plastic cover and looked almost good, with very lil signs of wear and tear2. Battery was at 86% capacity which again was very disappointing and am not sure how it will hold up over time. I will update this review after using the phone for a few days3. The accessories included were more of joke. Yes, technically there was a charger and a charging cable. I say technically since charger was not an OEM charger and the cable would not reach from outlet to the phone. It was barely 6 inches long. No thats not a typo but it was not even 6 inches.Just Phone: Good(This is not a review of an iPhone XS itself, but the renewed phone delivered)1.As mentioned above the physical condition of the phone was good. There were very few signs of wear and tear2. It was ATT Model A1920 (MT8X2LL/A), fully unlocked with both GSM/CDMA Support3. I was able to register my apple id and update it to latest firmware.4. FaceID works and that was reassuring5. Screen Quality did not look as impressive as i would have thought from OLED. Need to compare it more. Will update the review.6. However, the battery capacity was at 86% which was concerning since I am sure it will deplete to bare minimum or less than minimum pretty soon. I will update this review and return if things go south soonAmazon Renewed Guarantee: TBD1. I was not aware that there could potentially be a restocking fee if a product is returned. I came across this information thanks to a response from an amazon customer in the Q&amp; A section.2. Though on chat I was reassured by Amazon rep that Amazon would honor or help honor the guarantee within the warranty period.3. So I will update this if i even have to use amazon renewed guarantee. but still this is something to be aware of before making a renewed purchase.Overall, buying an expensive renewed phone can be a dicey affair. Wish there was much better or robust program around renewed phones.",2021年2月19日 在美国审核

Great phone at an amazing price,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I previously had an iPhone 7 and was looking for an affordable upgrade. I got this XS 256GB for $520 and feel like it was an amazing deal. Out of the box, the phone had 100% battery health, no scratches, dents or blemishes, and was fully functional. In my case, you would never know that it was a refurbished phone.As far as the phone itself, I grow to love it more and more everyday. The OLED screen is incredible, face recognition is excellent, the camera and videos are really amazing, wireless charging is a great feature, and the battery life is such an improvement from my previous phone, which had the battery replaced once before. As a plus, iOS 13 runs beautifully on this phone and I'm really enjoying the added features. I could easily see myself having this phone for years to come, provided I don't break or lose it...Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an upgrade but wants to save $200+ dollars on a new iPhone.PS I purchased my phone with Kiss Electronics. The phone arrived earlier than expected. Weird packaging, but like I said, in perfect condition (as far as I can tell).",2020年5月24日 在美国审核

Be Careful From Who You Buy!,"I just received my iPhone XS that I purchased from the provider 'Woot!', and the phone itself is amazing. Runs like a dream, has 94% remaining battery life, and only two small scuffs on the sides of the body.However, I wasn't a fan of the way they packaged it. They put it a paper mailer with the bubble wrap lining, and the phone + accessories were loose inside. The wall charger was a Lenovo plug, and the cable was a 3-inch AmazonBasics cord. DON'T PLAN ON USING WHAT THEY GIVE YOU! The phone was individually bubble-wrapped and wrapped in plastic, so while it was safe, I'd rather it be in its own box.Overall I'm very satisfied with what I get, but be prepared to spend up to $50+ on quality accessories because these are unusable. I'd recommend 'Woot!' over other providers because I paid for a good used phone, and that's what I got. Not much more. I see other reviews and their nightmare stories of torn up, unusable devices. I'll update this review if anything changes. Thanks for reading!",2021年4月17日 在美国审核

"90 days to try it, so buy it!","My experience so far has been excellent! I was so nervous to buy a used device but I did my research and felt very comfortable with Amazon’s generous 90 day return policy on these renewed phones and I took a chance on a seller that had lots of positive reviews.~Seller~ All Out Mobile and was shipped through Prime and arrived three days early!~Battery~Arrived with 97 percent battery health and holds a charge all day long with pretty aggressive use.~Apperance~Extremely minor scratches on the side that all my cases cover and are so small that I couldn’t get a clear photo of them. The screen is beautiful with no burned out pixels, front &amp; back glass have zero scratches.~Camera~Front &amp; back both work perfectly and the lenses are clear.~General Functionality~I switched my SIM card first thenI used the Bluetooth option to seamlessly change everything over from my old iPhone 6 to this XS. Each app works perfectly. The switchover from the thumbprint to Face ID was easy &amp; all of my passwords work (yay!) Upgrading from the 6 &amp; iOS 12, operating this feels so smooth and delightful.~Packaging~It came with plain white packaging, an apple branded charging cable and power brick, as well as a device to pop out the SIM card.Honestly, besides not having the satisfaction of opening a brand new product... this feels brand new and saving hundreds of dollars feels even better.I highly recommend trying this service. I will update my review if something changes but at this point, one week later, I’m thrilled!",2020年12月2日 在美国审核

Scam,"I received this phone and set it up relatively easy. The following morning I began to establish my logins for various things such as banks, and other services. I found it very suspicious that the phone began to act up. The screen became unresponsive, black and inoperable. What really concerned me is you could hear numbers being dialed, and other weird sounds. I processed the return following all instructions, my only option was to clear the phone via I cloud. Coincidentally the phone screen became active again shortly after. I was able to verify that the phone was no longer attached to my account and only a setup screen would pop up. My suspicious was further exasperated when the vendor contacted me asking me for my login info and then immediately turned around and said a refund would be processed minus the “restocking fee.” I paid just over $400 for the initial purchase, the “restocking fee” apparently is $375. The vendor has mad no other attempt to contact me or correct this error.",2021年3月22日 在美国审核
Acceptable condition iphone,"So basically you’re getting a refurbished iPhone with scratch free screen and back glass which is great, I was completely open to have a few minor scratches here and there and I was going to be ok with it, but I wasn’t okay with having all 4 edges of the phone full of Light to moderate scratches, battery health came as 95% which is not that bad, overall if you’re looking to buy a phone like this you would really have to think twice before making a purchase of you care about moderate scratches all around the phone, if you don’t, then this would be a perfect iPhone for you.

Wouldnt sync with old phone,"Bought this to finally upgrade from my beloved SE 1Gen , which I've bought multiple times because i like the platform. Because its being dropped from continuous support i decided to get an XS. The phone was in decent condition from seller [Woot}, it did have a small chip in the screen towards the top, but i didn't mind it. After charging both phones, I tried to sync them while next to each other, and it would fail after downloading the latest iOS update. This would continue and the phone would just reboot over and over. So i entered DFU mode and downloaded the update directly to the phone through itunes. Tried to sync, and still errored out. Tried to setup the phone without syncing, just barebones... still would error out and would stay in a continuous reboot loop. Tried to sync via icloud backup... error.

"Great Phone, needs better packaging and charger.","I had gotten this phone within 5 days and it came in almost perfect condition. The battery capacity was at 94% and it came already charged (50%). A few issues I have are that this product does NOT come with a wall outlet or a pair of headphones, nor does it come in the original apple box. The phone came in a small, white box that was wrapped in plastic. I would’ve liked better packaging but the phone wasn’t damaged at all so I can’t complain. However, the phone should have came wrapped in a plastic peel that you see most new phones have just to prevent any scratches on the screen seeing as though the phone is made of glass. The iPhone XS itself gathers fingerprints easily due to the fact that it’s glass so please invest in a case and a screen protector if that is something that bothers you. Other than these things, I do recommend this phone (try to get the 251gb version if you can). Also! If you have Metro PCS , you will probably have to pay a fee to transfer your service to your new phone (that’s if the older phone is already under this carrier). Even though this is compatible with wireless charging, I DO NOT recommend you use wireless charging as your main method of charging your device. You could wear down you’re battery faster that way.<br><br>Edit : it’s been over a year and we are still going strong! Though the battery capacity is at 80%</br></br>",2020年3月12日 在美国审核

Ok for the price.,"Amazon Renewed description is “works and looks like new”. I received it with a light scratch on the screen and battery life at 90%. Amazon may say that up to 80% is ok, but my current iPhone is at 87% battery life and can’t go without charging every 4-5 hours. So 80% is BS.I’ll keep the phone as it is a good value for the money and i need a phone. I can pay Apple to change the battery in a year, but honestly, I think I’ll tell my friends to get refurnished from Apple. It has a better warranty, new case and battery.

I can’t charge and have headphones in at the same time. Also, I accidentally take screenshots all the time when turning it off or voluming up because the buttons are directly across from each other.

Not bad except the battery was toast - then things got interesting….,"The phone was for my daughter as an upgrade to an aging iPhone 6S. All worked well - screen quality was nice, face recognition and all else seemed to work as it should, but it quickly became apparent that the battery life was not at all what it should be. Checking the Battery Health (under Settings&gt;Battery&gt;Battery Health&gt;Maximum Capacity), it was at 63%. I would think a strong battery would be rule #1 when you send out a “renewed” phone.After reaching out to the vendor, they agreed to replace it AFTER I sent the original one back to them. Two problems here - they seemed to expect me to pay to ship back their weak product and they expected my daughter to do without her new phone for what could easily have been 2-3 weeks. They did send me a shipping label after I asked for one but with a busy summer, the “without a phone” issue was going to be a problem, along with the fact that I didn’t know where we would be when they decided to send the new one to us.As an alternative, I thought that maybe I should just take it to the Apple store and pony up the $69 for a new battery rather than risk getting another phone a couple of weeks later with a battery that was at or below the 80% that Apple recommends as a minimum standard.After running the diagnostics, Apple said all was good except the battery. While replacing it, they broke the screen and then said something about calibration issues. Long story short, my $69 got me a new (or at worst an Apple refurbed) phone. But this was a particularly lucky set of circumstances - and it wouldn’t have been quite so good had my daughter not just backed up all of her vacation photos before we took the phone in to Apple.Basically, if you get a phone from this vendor, you might get one with a junky battery and you can either deal with weak-ish customer service and go through the hassle of swapping it out via mail or spend $69 for a new battery at Apple. Maybe the Apple store will break your phone and replace it for free too. \_(ツ)_/",2021年8月5日 在美国审核

Please be careful... speaker distorts over 50% volume And battery life is horrible,I was skeptical about ordering this phone after reading all the comments..

After receiving the product and started using it I realized that the battery was decreasing rapidly so I rushed and checked the battery life which showed 96% I then received an update from apple which kinda fixed the battery life problem I had to buy a battery case in order to use it for a full day .. my other fault was that I couldn’t increase the volume over 50% or else the speakers would start to distort which is horrible..

No ha sido reparado.El único defecto que presenta y que es casi imperceptible es un micro rayón en la parte superior derecha de la pantalla que para mi gusto personal no afecta en nada su estética ni su funcionamiento, es algo con lo que se puede vivir sin lamentarse.Otro punto en contra es que el cargador y el cable no son originales, pero son homologados y funcionan perfectamente.En conclusión, mi experiencia en esta compra ha sido satisfactoria.",2021年3月31日 在美国审核

The contrast is superb, the color is somewhat vivid, but not too much. The phone had a few scratches on the screen, but not very noticeable, other then that the phone was in like new condition. The only problem is that the battery life is at only 81%, I was hopping that it would be higher, but I can take videos at 1080p for about 3 to 4 hours, before recharging, which is ok for me.

Phone is great; Charger not so much,"Overall, I'm satisfied with my new phone. This is my first iPhone after being an Android user. Out of the box I was extremely happy that the screen and body of the phone were flawless. It works great, I love all of my iPhone features from Siri, facial recognition, and the ability to heart my text messages. I love the size of the XS compared to the clunky Galaxy i had before. It came with a charger and super long cable, which all seemed to be in new condition. It doesn't come with headphones, which I knew from the description and other reviews. After having it for about 2 weeks, I'm noticing the battery life could be better, but this may also be due to my usage and it's still better then my old phone. Tonight my xs died while I had it plugged in and charging. An hour later, I still couldn't get it to charge which scared me and made me think it was something wrong with the phone. I switched charging ports and finally started to see a charge. So don't put too much faith in The ""Ashley Audio and Accessories"" branded charger so as not to get stranded with a dead phone. Replace the charger with something more trustworthy. The return policy seems pretty good and gave me piece of mind that if it was a problem with the phone, I'd have options for returning it without too much lost.",2020年12月1日 在美国审核

I updated the software, hoping that would fix it, but to no avail. I will not pay more then I already have for the phone, so I am going to return it. Personally, if a phone says it is refurbished, that should mean all it's functions are in working order, has a good screen, and good battery life.

Literally in like NEW condition. Battery health is the trade off.,"Nearly perfect. When received it I looked this thing over with scrutiny and magnifying glass precision. There was NO indication that it could have been used by ANYBODY, ever. None. Essentially, a new phone. Set up was a snap and it went right on the off brand the charger included.

UPDATE I sent the phone back and received the one i ordered (both phones came a day early) the new phone is in just as good condition AND the speaker works lol siri works a little better but thats apples problem i think so im happy it was a bit annoying to have to return the phone i dont know how they didnt check the speaker quality but i bumped it to 4 stars but well see how the return goes hopefully they get the phone and refund me.

Average condition,"Phone came with dents, cracks and scratches along the edges of the screen, overall moderate condition but not worth the price paid honestly, maybe $600 max but that’s my opinion.

It's a decent phone literally made out of glass,"We bought my 14yo son this phone for his birthday. All his friends had iPhones and he wanted to get an iPhone so he could communicate better with them since Apple limits the way iPhones can communicate with Android phones. He's been happy with the camera and video abilities of the phone and the facial recognition is really good on it. The battery life on this phone is ok. Much better than his old S7 but won't hold a candle to my S10 5G. The biggest problem is the screen is brittle. I mean BRITTLE. He was having issues with the screen having image burn, which was annoying but apparently a common problem with iPhone XS. Well, we have the phone in an Otterbox with a temepred glass screen protector. We had the exact same setup on his old S7 that lasted two years without any real cracks. Two weeks he had this phone and he was just sitting beside me on the bed and it slipped and hit the floor, maybe 2ft or less. Boom, screen cracked. The tempered glass protector is fine, no damage to that, but the screen is broken pretty badly now. This must be the worlds cheapest glass on this thing. We knew going in to it that iPhone glass is not anywhere near as strong as the glass on Samsungs, but I didn't realize it was this bad.He is pretty unhappy with his phone right now and is saying he wished he just stuck with an Android.",2021年2月22日 在美国审核

AVOID the seller BUYSPRY!!,"Avoid the seller Buyspry! I bought a phone for my daughter and it wasn’t working right within weeks. I returned it and bought another one hoping it was a fluke because the seller came recommended. That one seemed better so I assumed we were good.Bought myself one from BuySpry and that one had problems. Returned it and bought a new iPhone SE 2020 instead.Now, months later, my daughter’s phone isn’t working right. There are various problems, the main being that the touchscreen is off, making texting difficult, trying to buy things or play games is difficult. Anything you use the iPhone for is incredibly frustrating.I reached out to the seller but it’s past the return window (May 2020) and they advised me to get it fixed at a local shop.Again, avoid the seller BuySpry. They’re reconditioned phones are terrible and it’s not worth the money.The XS itself, is only okay.

Can’t Beat Value,"I bought this phone back in May and using this as my very first iPhone has been amazing. I have the silver 64gb model and when it arrived it looked flawless (besides a couple of scuffs on the band but a case will make you forget) I was scared to buy a 2nd hand phone especially with an oled screen because of burn in but this phone came with none at all from what i can see. I got 84% battery health out of the box (wanted 90+ but hey everyone has a different experience) After almost 2 months it dropped to 83% which still isn’t bad since it’s a 2nd hand phone. Battery life is what you’d expect from an iPhone, but overall I love it and it serves me well. To anyone who’s skeptical and hesitant like i was before buying a 2nd hand phone, just buy it and save your money, it’s completely worth it. I literally bought a $1000 phone for under $400.

The battery life is currently at 89% after the first couple of months of ownership for comparison. The phone's outside was like new when received, however, internally I began to have startling issues pretty early on (unuseable three months after purchase). My phone began experiencing a reboot loop and after being unable to correct the issue through updating and restoring, I brought it to a local trusted shop that found a damaged wire connected to the face id that was causing the issue. I had it fixed for $40 but I lost two months of data since my last full backup. The technician believed that the damage was likely caused during the screen replacement as part of the refurbishment process. My face id no longer works due to this issue, but otherwise is great. Hopefully this is a rare complication and perhaps buying a warranty wouldn't have been a bad idea. Otherwise, I love the phone.",2021年1月30日 在美国审核

I worked with tech support initially but after a hour on the iPhone thinking the problem was corrected, problem resurfaced.The second XS worked normally for about a week but then the display would occasionally distort for a minute or so.For the potential savings it may be worth the possibility of getting a beautiful used phone.You do have 90 days to evaluate and the vendor is very good about handling returns.

BAD BATTERY and BAD SCREEN GLASS,"Bought this phone for a couple of weeks, still in the return period. This battery is so bad which can not even last for more than half day. Single movie would cost about 35% battery? Seriously?The screen glass is also too bad to use. I have no habit to use a screen protector, and I never put my phone with the key. I found the screen especially top half has some kind of wearing on the glass which I can feel with my finger touch. Due to this I can not read the words on that area of the screen clearly and smoothly. Feel the words very indistinct like having a shadow on the words. Some kind of gray pixels are also found, I did not know whether I saw gray pixels because of the wearing the glass and change the angle of the light.Face recognition is also very fair. If I hold the phone on the hand and set it apart like 1 ft then it can unlock pretty quick. if I wake up in the morning and hold it .5 ft to the eye then it can not unlock it anyway. Maybe I used it in the wrong way.Overall, the experience was bad, already returned for a refund. Never known a refurbished item could have a such bad screen feeling. Gonna purchase something else instead. Could be a pleasure if the seller returned funds real quick. :)",2020年4月20日 在美国审核

The battery life is at 87% which is disappointing because my old iPhone that I am selling is at 94% which means I’m switching out great battery life for much lower battery quality even the phone I bought is newer. The tempered glass screen protect is put in crookedly which is annoying because it’s not that hard to put them on. I have 90 days so I’ll see how it goes. It also makes me nervous that I don’t know exactly what was wrong with this phone before. I’d say the price for the quality of battery life is overpriced for a used refurbished phone. Also it came with those crappy chargers you’d buy at a gas station. Probably won’t be using it because I heard if you don’t use an original apple charger it can decline the life of your phone battery.",2020年2月21日 在美国审核

Nice phone but not in Excellent condition.,"The received phone was beautiful, in excellent physical shape with no blemishes.The battery level was at 82%, which was slightly disheartening to me, as I previously purchase an iphone 6s from Verizon Pre-owned with an excellent battery health.I was expecting something similar with this phone, but that wasn't the case.I did reach out to the vendor about my concerns, but I did not receive a response from them.After a couple of weeks, I noticed that the earpiece speaker was crackling when I played song files on the phone.This discovery unfortunately led me to request a replacement phone, but I was not aware that Verizon Pre-owned does not offer replacement items.So now I am waiting on a refund.",2021年4月17日 在美国审核

"Product was in good condition, but the battery was disappointing.","I ordered two iPhone XS models, and when I opened the package I found no defects, scratches or anything worrying (aside from some dust around the camera), I did some diagnostic testing on both phones and everything was genuine and working properly. I was able to sign in with my apple ID and the phones were unlocked as promised, I had no issues with any of the software and my phones updated to the latest IOS with no issues.HOWEVER my only issue was that one of the iPhone's I bought had a battery health of 77% rather than the promised 80%, The second iPhone had a health of 80% (I guess that's what I was promised on the description). If anyone is going to order from here I would be more concerned about your battery health rather than the condition of your phone, this may be different for each person but consistently the battery is the biggest complain I have heard from renewed and refurbished phones.",2022年4月21日 在美国审核
Sim card tray missing and sim port obstructed,"As the head line says, the tray that holds the sim card was missing. Which was disappointing to my daughter, who is turning 16 at the end of the month. This was presented as an early B-day gift, because her old one started giving out this week.Of course, I overlooked that the fact that the sim tray was missing and she discovered this after opening the gift.Anyway, rather than going through the return/figurative fist fight for a replacement or refund that would undoubtedly take a week or more to resolve; I decided to try and curb her disappointment by hitting a cellphone repair shop a few blocks away.The repairman was great! At first, we could not get the sim trays to fit. After attempting with several trays from various iPhone models that he had in his shop, he decided to open it and found the port was obstructed with a small piece of plastic. After that the tray fit fine and the repairman said nothing was owed, but I insisted and payed him something. If you're in the Niles, IL area his shop is at 7637 N. Milwaukee Ave, just outside the Chicago city limits.After finding out that there was a piece of plastic obstructing the port, I'm guessing someone at this resale shop decided just to ship it without the tray, because they could not get it to fit. Or, the shop is so disorganized that the phone was shipped by mistake. Either way, it was a pretty big mistake and I count myself lucky that I knew of a place that fixed it cheaply for me.Other than that, once the port was cleared the phone worked great and she is quite happy with it.",2021年6月4日 在美国审核

Phone Bricked Within Half a Year,"Phone was bought on April 27, 2020. Worked perfectly through out the months I had it, used it daily and never dropped it. October of 2020 I was using it for work at night and screen went black, flashed green and pink very quickly, then seemingly turned off by itself. Tried to boot it back up but was greeted by an endless loop of the Apple logo. Never got past it and when I emailed the company about the phone bricking, they said they couldn't handle the issue due to the warranty only being for NINETY DAYS. Not even for half a year did they have the warranty and not even a year which is baffling. My phone bricked after buying it for myself for my birthday within 6 months, and the company warranty couldn't even cover me. Learn from my mistake and don't buy this phone without at LEAST getting a year warranty on it from somewhere, or just better yet don't buy the phone at all.

Came with a aftermarket LCD screen,First off the few pros: The condition of the device itself was really good and came with solid battery health (94% on my unit)The main con and why I returned the device was the aftermarket LCD screen it had installed instead of OLED which the iPhone XS should have. The entire point of buying a XS is because you want that nicer screen otherwise I could have just got a XR instead. The LCD screen also has a slightly thicker bezel near the bottom. I will not buying phones again from Amazon Renewed as you just don’t know what you’re getting and the seller might have replaced the screen or replaced other parts without disclosing it. I’ve usually bought my phones and tablets through Swappa and never had a issue on there + you can actually see the device you are getting. I will be using them again instead.(In the photo on the left is the XS with the LCD screen and on the right is my 11 Pro with the original OLED screen.

Damaged Headset Speaker,"I ordered this item with Electronicity USA. Straight out of the box, it looked good. However, when I tried to activate the phone, there wasn't the necessary IMEI number in the settings.

The audio quality wasn't great, and I wasn't able to clean the debris out myself.I didn't take stars off for this, but I also received a phone that was well out of the general AppleCare warranty. This means the iPhone was sold by Apple over a year ago. This is obviously expected for a refurbished iPhone, but keep this in mind that in case you have a problem with your iPhone.EDIT: I was wrong about the missing IMEI number.

I contacted the seller asking about an exchange since ""they guarantee like new"" and seeing as it was only a few days past the 90 days i thought they wouldn't be like apple and take the phone back and give me another one, since they can fix the faulty one they sold me. Apparently though, that is their actual game. Make the phones good enough to last the 90 days and then they can wash their hands of it. I mean at least apple gives you a year, so that you can at least feel semi justified in re-buying their phone a year later.The fact that their refurbished phone broke legit less than 2 weeks post the delivery date is a HUGE red flag. if this was a case of a year or something I would get it, but less than two weeks?!? This is defiantly a we only make it good enough to last until we dont have to care but can still charge a boat load energy.I do not recommend buying this as you will have to buy another one in 3 months. might as well buy a brand new one since you'll end up spending close to $1000 in 6 months.

It also arrived with a maximum battery capacity of 85% which I was ok with, as well as a charging cube, cord, and a SIM card ejector tool. However, the phone came with a screen protector that hid many scratches. This included a scratch that ran the entire length of the screen. The scratches are noticeable at arm’s length with the screen off. Even though I didn’t see the severity of the scratches until I removed the screen protector to put on a different one, I felt that it was dishonest not to disclose the condition of the screen.",2021年3月5日 在美国审核

"scratched and the speaker dented, battery eh refund was easy","I was upgrading from a 6s plus. It arrived earlier than expected, and the front screen was great looking, however…. Both aluminum sides were completely top to bottom full of scratches, there was also scratches around the camera, and the speaker on the front had a dent in it. The battery was at 84% which is lower than my current iPhone 6s Plusso for over 350 dollars I really wasn’t that impressed, I know it’s refurbished, just not worth a couple hundred dollars to me? I returned it, they were really far with my refund so I will give them that! I was worried about losing my button but the facial recognition was honestly pretty quick every time. I just ordered the iPhone XR from a different seller, let’s hope it’s a better experience!",2021年5月20日 在美国审核

Reason NOT to purchase renewed items,"When you buy a renewed item you would expect it to at least have better battery life than almost worn. Apple says when the battery life gets to 80% or lower , it’s considered worn and should be changed. So I pay more than $300 for an iPhone XS and now I would have to pay Apple to change the battery. These items are supposed to be tested and checked. Apparently the one that checked mine was drunk or forgot their glasses that day and passed this one. If it sounds like I’m a little pissed then you would be right. First it was late being delivered and then I set it up only to find the battery life was close to being worn. My granddaughter loves the phone , only had a couple days and I’m wanting to send it back but she will be without a phone for who knows how long if I ask for a replacement. I’m really torn on what to do. Pay to have the battery changed or send it back and just buy one from a more reputable store. Don’t get me wrong , the phone is in beautiful condition.

Scratches all along the sides of the phone. The back of the phone has scratches &amp; cracks near the camera &amp; the screen has a black spot on it. The worst part is, they have made it difficult to send back. Often times they will have an option to have the post office print the shipping label but I have to print it so I had to go buy ink &amp; get my printer out to print the label to send it back. I absolutely hate dealing with returns so if they are minor/cosmetic issues, I'll try to just deal with it but this item looks like I was sent someones broken phone. I cant believe I spent $300 on this phone &amp; it's completely unusable. The battery life is non existent. It dies within a couple hours without use.

This is the WORST Amazon Purchase I have EVER made,"Listen, I know your reading other reviews before you buy this phone. Some reviews are saying they got a near MINT condition iphone, or a iphone that's in""not so bad"" condition.But then there are ones like the one I received. This screen had the most amount of scuffs, scratches, and cracks i've ever seen. It's so bad. Also, the battery was at a frightening low 85%. The phone was not even factory reset either!! In fact, the last person who used this even left their call history on here AND a picture. Are you serious? You actually got to be joking sending out a product like this given the listing description the seller is providing. This literally feels like someone else's return.Oh ALSO, I spent $15 EXTRA dollars for FASTER shipping.......and it ended up arriving 4 DAYS LATER than standard shipping would cost. ANDthe seller shipped this in a jiffy envelope. I repeat, the seller sent a iPhone in a JIFFY envelope. This is beyond unacceptable. And I have pictures to prove all of this. Its such a tight fit in this envelope that I can’t even get it back inside to send it back!So currently, I have reached out to the seller because I would like to receive a replacement iPhone XS Space Gray Unlocked in good condition like in the other positive reviews you see here as well as a refund on my shipping costs so we'll see what happens. However, if that does not work out I am returning, getting a full refund and never looking back.TLDR: The amount of stress this purchase has caused me is not worth the price in the slightest.

Slightly Problematic,"The phone worked fine for the most part.... kinda.<br>On the first day it already had glitches with the unlock screen &amp; momentary unresponsiveness with the touch screen. But compared to my last phone, I didn’t mind it much.Then one day, almost a month after purchasing, the lock screen just stopped working completely. Couldn’t unlock my phone at all. I figured, restart the phone it’s fine. And for a while, that seemed to work. Until after a few minutes of use, black lines just started appearing on my screen vertically. And glitches on the screen.So the phone was slightly damaged all throughout my usage, even tho I bought the best condition! But it still performed decently besides the occasional glitching.With refurbished iPhones, these things can happen &amp; you sometimes might get unfortunate. Some of them will neverfunction well, no matter how many times it’s repaired/renewed.Giving one star for leaving me off the grid for 2 weeks waiting for refund &amp; forcing me to deal with a subpar phone while I had it. Got a new one, same model and now ik what THIS phone SHOULD have been like. Pales in comparison, immensely!</br>",2021年6月9日 在美国审核

The screen developed a dead spot and the battery was getting below 80% which is when Apple recommends replacement.

Battery defective. Amazon refused to honor replacement arrangement.,"I received the phone within 2 days of ordering. The packaging was fine and initially it appeared to be in great condition. However, I checked the battery health on the first day which stated “Important Battery Message: Your battery’s health is significantly degraded.”The Maximum Capacity for the battery was 78%. No problem, I thought, because one of the reason’s I bought from Amazon is that the phone was advertised “to have a battery which exceeds 80% capacity relative to new” and was “Guaranteed by Amazon” to be “eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied. “Well clearly, I was not satisfied to receive a phone with a significantly degraded battery. So, I called Amazon Customer service to explain the problem and request a replacement. I did this on the same day I received the phone. The representative was helpful and told me he would send out a replacement immediately, and even upgrade the shipment method for no extra charge.He also told me, both in conversation and in writing to “use the box the replacement comes in to return the original.”That way, I would not be without a phone while waiting for the replacement to arrive.The day the replacement was scheduled to arrive and but had not, I called Amazon customer service back to inquire about the status. Much to my surprise, I was told the replacement phone order had been cancelled by the third-party seller because the original had not been returned. This irritated me for two reasons: (1) I had never been notified the replacement order had been cancelled—apparently, had I not called Amazon was simply going to drop the issue, and (2) I was specifically told by Amazon Customer Service that I did not need to return the original until the replacement was received.I told the agent this was unacceptable and wanted the replacement sent to me, as had been previously arranged. When it became clear that she would not be able to help me, I asked to speak with her manager. After providing her with my phone number, she said her manager would call me back. That phone call never happened.The following day I called Amazon customer service again, now the third time trying to get this issue resolved. I explained the steps I had taken thus far and was put on hold so the representative could verify if my replacement order “was legit.”When I asked what “legit” meant, she said she needed to verify if this was unusual activity on the account because it was a phone purchase. I told her that of course it was legit, as I had email documentation regarding the entire process!After being on hold, she came back and told me the replacement phone would be delivered within 5 days. She also said she would personally call me on that day to verify that it was received. I asked her to clarify that I would receive the replacement first, prior to sending the original back, according to the instructions I had previously received via email. She looked up that email and saw it said: “Please feel free to use the box the replacement comes in to return the original…”After reading that she placed me on hold again.After a minute or so, she came back on the line and asked if she could place me on hold for an additional few minutes. I asked why. She said she was trying to find out what went wrong with the first replacement order. When she came back on the line, she told me “to be on the safe side” I should return the original defective phone first to receive a replacement.I reiterated that this was unacceptable and that I had held up my end of the bargain and done exactly as Amazon had told me to do. I wanted the replacement sent first before I returned the defective phone. She said the email I received was in error and the person who sent it made a mistake—the defective phone would need to be returned before the replacement is shipped out. I told her that while I understand that people make mistakes, I did not think I should be penalized (i.e., be without a phone for at least 5 days) for a mistake that Amazon made. She apologized for the mistake but made it clear that I would not receive a replacement until the original was returned. I informed her I would be writing a negative review.To summarize: I was sent a defective phone, was given incorrect information about how to replace it, had the replacement order silently cancelled without being notified, and Amazon refused to follow through on the terms of their agreement.

BROKE AFTER FIVE MONTHS (DID NOT DROP/BREAK) HARDWARE IS FAULTY!,"I had a cracked/broken phone (Yea, iPhone 6) for years that worked better than this phone. However, my boyfriend felt bad that my phone was older and cracked, so he bought me a refurbished one from this site on Amazon. I have other friends and family with this phone, and they were pleased with the product. I even had a family member buy a refurbished phone from another company (we should have used them!!!)I had hesitation about this phone from the beginning of my setup and thought about sending it back. But I finally got it set up and went on. It was nice to have an updated, non-cracked phone that I could take pictures with.However, a month ago, it started with the bottom portion glitching out and unable to type. So, I researched the problem and did the recommended troubleshooting. Unfortunately, it's only got worse, and now to send one text, I have to turn the phone off and on repeatedly. Otherwise, it will text normally then start adding letters randomly and quickly or it will jump to another page.If I open an app, it will start jumping around moving pages, letters jumping (playing Works with Friends), and many more hardware issues!!The phone was not dropped or broken. I use it very little compared to other phone users. I typically use the phone to play a word game, text, take pictures, check email (work), and social media (even though I've been on a 2-week detox from that part).It is very disheartening to purchase a $400 product only to have it five months later malfunction for NO obvious reason. I understand I was bought a refurbished phone, but you would expect it to last longer than five months!!Thanks for my $400 paperweight! I would not recommend buying from this company and definitely buy the year warranty when buying refurbished products.

Defective Device ,"I’m rather perturbed. You spend hundreds on something that is guaranteed to work as new.Sadly, mine was defective. Imagine my irritation when I noticed that a strip around half a centimeter wide, roughly where the “I” key is when the keyboard is fully expanded, is completely unresponsive! And worse, the device came to me overseas mere days before the return cutoff! So I have to toggle the keyboard and/or rotate the screen so I can access certain functions in apps or swipe away something that only runs in landscape mode! Waste of money!!",2020年10月7日 在美国审核

HIT OR MISS,"I am extremely disappointed with the product. 5 months after purchase and the display is not working. I have two friends who have bought their phones from here and they were happy with it. That is why i decided to also go here to buy a new phone. However, I regret not taking the negative reviews into consideration before buying a refurbished iPhone. First off I realized soon after receiving my iPhone XS that it would heat up pretty quickly and become pretty hot. It bugged me because I spent 670 dollars after tax and I felt that after spending that amount it should have worked optimally. I regret not returning right then and there, but I brushed it off because I felt that I was being to picky and it wouldn't be a big deal. A couple months in my screen randomly went completely white. I tried rebooting it and accidentally called 911 twice. I couldn't cancel the call because the screen wasn't showing. Anyways after sometime the screen went back to normal except a very small portion in the upper left corner where the battery percentage shows was completely black. It did not affect my usage since it was a small part of the screen so I just continued on with it like that. I was just happy the phone turned on. Fast forward to now the entire screen is black. I thought my phone had died so I put it on the charger to no avail. I can tell the phone is on. Hey Siri worked but the frickin screen is black. So take heed to this review if you are thinking about purchasing. I feel frustrated and unlucky that the phone I happened to get was so janky.",2021年1月3日 在美国审核

Easily the best deal ever for an iPhone,"Full disclosure.. I got mine from AT&amp;T but Amazon knows I have spent thousands with them.<br>A lot of initial noise about the screen not being OLED or HD but honestly the screen is just fine. Images are crisp. The battery life is quite decent and charges quickly. Face ID is really good. No home button but you really don't miss it. I am trading up to the iPhone 13 Pro using my XR as a trade-in. AT&amp;T shipped out the phone two days ago and it's arriving tomorrow.I feel like I am betraying a friend... This is how solid the XR really is. You can't really go wrong.. I just traded up because AT&amp;T was allowing for a great trade-in value. Since this is the only way I can keep buying up into the next generation, every two to three years I trade up again.This is a great phone. Everything about it is solid. You will be happy with it. Just do get a good screen protector and case. These phones will lose value if they get all dinged up... unless you are going to keep it for ever... but regardless... do you really want a dinged up phone?Also take care to check the battery health.. It is insettings. Quoting Apple ""Apple considers any iPhone with a battery capacity of 80% or above to be in optimal condition."" I have to say if I received a phone with a battery in the low 80s I would make a stink.. but that's just me.</br>",2021年11月11日 在美国审核

The phone constantly reboots itself every 2-3 minutes or so. Defective,"When I received the phone initially, there were few scruffles on the edges. No visible scratches on the screen or on back. So far so good. When I turned on the phone and started to set it up, after a few minutes it automatically rebooted. I didn't think much of it and went ahead to finish setting up, only for the phone to restart 5-6 times until set up was done. I finally set it up, bit frustrated, thought of looking at comments, where many initially had few problems until the suggest force-restart. I did that, and even now, every time I wanna use the phone, I have to either turn it on because it's already powered off or enter the passcode, as, ""iPhone requires a passcode after restart"".Now, within hours of holding this phone, I decided to finally return it as, 1) ""It restarted while I was on a video conference"", 2) ""When I was on phone calls"", 3) ""I was installing apps and it rebooted"".They mention that ""This product is not Apple certified, but has been professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers. The product may have minimal scratches or dents, and a battery with at least 80% capacity. Box may be generic and accessories may not be original, but will be compatible and fully functional.""So did you deliberately send me a defunct product?Boy, to worse it off, the return isn't free.

Screen and speaker problem,"Ok I got a space gray iPhone XS with 256GB and I was happy to get it, it came in a odd box but I didn’t really care about that I got the phone and there are dings and scratch’s on The outer metal case of the phone and I can tell that I he front glass and LCD scream were replaced be the screen kinda drags the image like on a old computer we’re the image stays for a second, that was one thing I wasannoyed about that but the second thing was that it sound like the bottom speaker was broken at one point and they bought another one but it is a really cheap speaker because at certain points it has a pitch of sound with it and it just doesn’t sound good the speaker next to the Face ID camera works perfectly just the one at the bottom of the phone is really bad me personally I don’t care if it has dings or scratch’s on the outer Metal frame of the phone it just really annoys me when they replace the speaker with a bad one and that they get a cheaper LCD screen just to save a little bit of money I mostly notice the bad cream when I’m scrolling on instagram, Twitter or YouTube it’s when you are scrolling that it is the most noticeable problem wouldn’t buy again if I new they replaced parts with bad ones also battery gets kinda worm/hot when charging or on FaceTime and sometimes just randomly but that may just happen when running powerful or changing so that may just be normal not to sure but the battery stays charged all day so not too worried about the battery",2019年12月15日 在美国审核
Logic Board Failed After 18 Months,"After an extremely frustrating experience in with Apple Support during the COVID crisis.I was told that the Power Up issue with my iPhone XS was a failed Logic Board (this took 7 days, several calls, chats).This phone was 18 months old and had no problems leading up to the ""failure"".Yesterday, Apple Support posted on my Repair webpage that it was not the battery and I had to replace my XS, I was not told the new diagnosis (it seemed very much like Support was instructed not the explain the diagnosis) just that the Phone must be replaced.I did not get the Logic Board failure explanation until I spoke/chatted with not less than 5 Apple Support people in at least 3 countries.I finally got a nice duo based in OK would were honest and frankly not rude (weird for Apple which in the past has always had polite Support people).While failed Logic board was the diagnosis, the way this was handled and the fact that Apple has stopped selling iPhone XS makes me believe that the Phone had bad Logic Boards from the beginning and Apple made a financial and marketing decision not to make this public and simply discontinue sales of the Phone rather than make it part of the Exchange and Repair Extension Programs.Since Apple has stopped selling the Phone XS, I feel obligated to let people know that I believe that the Logic Boards were faulty from the beginning and Apple's quality control may be failing.I elected not to purchase the replacement and I will use my old 7 until I have confidence that Apple is not selling inferior tech.",2020年4月8日 在美国审核

Simply unreliable,"I had iPhone XS and it was my first iPhone. For the first two months it worked fine. The problems started with iOS updates. The first update didn't install and some apps stopped working. After the support people fixed it, the phone started to shut down on its own. The next update turned the phone into a brick. When I tried to turn it on, it would display that ""Connect to iTunes"" picture. At the Apple store the technician magically revived the phone using a new update but the very next day the phone started to drop wifi connection. I think the phone had serious hardware problems but Apple engineers figured out how to partially overcome the problems through software tricks. This is how Apple avoids replacing a bad phone with a new one. I ended up paying for an upgrade.",2019年10月12日 在美国审核

"Update error ""4013"" renders almost flawless iphone unusable","Let me explain the one starI am an Apple iphone fan (or was)with my spouse and kids also owning different iPhone models. I have owned pretty much every model of iPhone since the very first one.This issue I am listing here has happened to me with 3 of the models I have owned, iphone 5s, iphone 6s and now to iphone xs (did not upgrade to 11 yet)The one-star rating does not reflect the performance or aesthetics which is all the best when it comes to iPhone.The part I am frustrated is the reliability which I am going to try and explain here.I hope someone in Apple pays attention to this, since I have seen several other posts in forums where other are complaining as well.In summary the iphone xs randomly failed to start up after an update and this is not the first model I am seeing this issue.I left the phone charged one night and the message indicated that update will be auto deployed.Woke up in the morning and I was unable to restart the phone. The start process ends up with the sign indicating asking the phone to be connected to itunes for restore. Connecting to itunes and trying to update or even worst case restore from backup will fail with error code “4013”Now I am into IT myself and am fairly handy with this process so as suggested by the instructions for “4013” error I have updated the itunes, updated the laptop computer, used a different and even new cable and tried this update process in all 6 laptop/desktop I have at my place.None of these solves the error.Called up Apple support and indicated this happened after an update process. The person walks you through all the steps which you have already done and indicates this will have to be shipped back to Apple and for a price of almost new phone they can repair it.The phone itself is little more than a year….. so out of Apple warranty and I don not have extended warranty. I paid the full price for this approx.. $1250 for the 256GB version which now sits as a piece of metal with no use. Even worst all data I had since last backup is lost.This is the third time over the years this issue happens where the iphone stops working after an update. All these phones look flawless with no issues and almost brand new, so I wonder why Apple pushes updates and takes no responsibility when they cause the phone to stop working.I was an ardent Apple fan to date and this has made me and family think twice before investing in future iphones.- Victor",2020年9月4日 在美国审核
Phone is great,"So the iPhone itself is great, vendor did a great job. 3 stars is for Apple. We bought this specifically to address connectivity issues my daughter had with her Dexcom CGM and iPhone 7+. Newer phone did nothing to resolve. Apple says ""we dunno, maybe reset the phone?"" and Dexcom says it doesn't know. Basically a BT clusterf@ck that no one wants to own. Not sure why an App gets approved (a medical device App!) that only works sometimes. Forums (Apple and Dexcom) yield about 40-50% success reports. Most have just given up.Sorry for the rant.Seller was great.",2020年10月29日 在美国审核

Absolute Trash,"It looks like the seller took a belt sander to the screen before they shipped it. Not only that, they hid it with a cheap screen protector too, as if I wouldn't pull it off the second I opened the package. I expected some minor scratches, but this is ridiculous. If you look closely, there are two decent sized chips in the screen too that distort the pixels behind it.They literally ship the lowest grade they possibly can. The minimum battery health they're allowed to ship is 80%. They gave me one at 81%. Do not buy refurbished from Amazon. Buy refurbished from Apple.My seller was ""Tech Exchangee"" (yes, with the poor spelling), so steer clear of them.",2021年5月29日 在美国审核
Not Excellent Condition,"The phone has a very visible scratch on the screen, despite being listed as ""like new, excellent condition."" I'm not as bothered by that as I am the faulty charging port. I didn't even realize it until a month after I got it, because I had been charging it wirelessly. But when I was in my car, I decided to plug it in and found that it will charge for a second and then the lightning cable just falls out of the port. I tried a bunch of different chargers and it's all the same. They all fit snugly in my old phone, so it's definitely this one that's the problem. I probably won't be buying Amazon renewed again. As a first time purchaser, this leaves a very bad impression.",2022年6月14日 在美国审核

I did return it ONLY because it was smaller than what I thought it would be. I wanted the same size as my 7plus. It was just a little smaller width wise than the 7plus. I almost hated to send it back because it came perfectly. Returning took a few days and I reached out to the seller and they responded so fast!

Ask what is checked or replaced,"iPhone came in excellent condition with battery max capacity at 86%, this is a 2 1/2 year old phone so Amazon does promise at least 80% battery life. One issue that I did come against was when I took this iPhone straight to the apple store to replace battery and in taking it to them it was discovered that a screw located internally was stripped. So replacing the battery wasn’t even an option. Amazon does guarantee that their products are throughly checked and inspected to look and run like new and that was a clear misconception. I’m still pleased with my phone. I do wish I could’ve gotten the battery replacement. Apple couldn’t proceed with replacing the battery only option was keeping or paying for replacement. Now with keeping this phone I wonder if i accidentally crack my screen will that screw give me issue later down the road with changing whatever is broken?",2021年11月17日 在美国审核

Extremely worn Battery,"To start off, the box it came in wasn’t anything special. It alone doesn’t effect my review, but it was pretty disappointing nonetheless. You get a charger and charging box with it, and no other accessories aside from the iPhone itself. I didn’t have any scruffs and to start off the phone was very impressive. I noticed my battery had gone down tremendously and that’s where the problem lies. I was on my phone for 1 hour and 30 minutes, (this is total time on the phone as I just opened it) where I spent time downloading and making personal changes. As going through things in settings, I came across battery life. My iPhone 6s Plus I had used for a year, (about 6 hours a day of use) has a current battery life of 93%. This supposedly new iPhone XS, has 88% battery life. This means it’s been used for well over a year by another user, and has run out of life. I think I’m lucky to have not received scratches because this was terrible. I would not have made the purchase if I saw this.

"Great Deal, nice phone!","Product arrived a day early which I was excited about.<br>I bought the XS Gold, 64GB, AT&amp;T unlocked. Absolutely no issues so far.Battery life at 100% which shocked me being a refurbished phoneNo scratches or scuffs on the sides or screen. Couldn’t believe that as well. (Will add better pictures soon of edges phone currently in case)Paid $375 shipped to my door in less than a week. (February 15, 2021)The Screen quality is a beautiful display with The OLED really showing the colors, and the response time from the operating system is incredible.Face Recognition compared to my girlfriend’s IPhone X is quicker but not by anything that would make a difference, however opening large apps I notice the XS is slightly faster.I’d say spend the extra $50-$75 in today’s market to buy the XS instead of the X. 4GB of ram instead of 3GB, Camera Stutter features, etc..I would recommend if you are hesitant to buy refurbished, do it. This is my 3rd refurbished phone and every single one from the 5GS, 6S, and now this XS have been as perfect as my family’s Plan-bought phones.Packaging was basic but effective!My only complaint so far is the charger brick and charger are pretty cheap, I’ll be buying a regular charger from Apple.Overall 10/10.

Bad Battery,The battery on arrival is 80% health. Meaning I can only charge my phone 80% of the way. This is sad even for a refurbished phone.

I know they said the product might have minimal scratches. But this is not minimal! I think it’s ridiculous. I didn’t come with protective plastic or anything either.

Physically, it is PERFECT, and I mean PERFECT, not 1 scratch or dent anywhere, it's as if I'm the first person to use it. No marks, no dirt, very clean and crisp, the front, back, sides, top and bottom.

Last update..,"I am transitioning backward from my stolen iphone pro 12 :’( to xs and will list out some pros and cons from the experience<br>Cons first:- it took a while to install all the apps when setting up. Probably about 1-2hours to complete setup of all the apps with a few reboots because the installation wasn’t initiating. it took less than 30 min for pro 12- my battery max capacity is at 84%. Maybe it could be put in the list of ‘pro’s but well, it does seem to drain faster than newer phones. For less than $400 I guess it could still be a steal- heats up pretty badly when charging but I’ve experienced this with newer phones as well..- bit of delay in typing, noticing as I’m typing this review I have to continuously retype a few characters and mistypes ‘a’ with a period? but it is really irritating every time I type ‘a’ I have to backspace and try few more times.- freezing apps - like uber/messaging apps when trying to make a callPros:- externally close to impeccable, even came with a screen protector!- I don’t experience tooo much slowness/delay using the phone other than sometimes freezing apps &lt;10x/day- I love the design of xs compared to 12 pro- screen quality is not so differentiable from my human eyes comparing to 12 pro- exchange/return period of 90 days-if I find ‘a’ keyboard issue uncompromisable I could return within 90 days for exchange. This is really a decent amount of time for at least to try out- supports esim!Anyway I am loving my phone so far except for a few things like keyboard issue (pretty major), battery capacity, and not supporting 5g as xs model.. we’ll see how this goes I might stillrequest for an exchange or refund if these issues really come to unbearable in the next few weeks..Unfortunately despite how much I wanted to love this beautiful phone, I have returned it and got a different refurbished phone (different generation). I still think it was a good to have tried out, as I’ve had issues with new iPhone xs phone that I got years back where it continuously heated up, auto rebooted until it ran out of battery, and had to get replaced as well. And now having had problems with multiple iphone xs’, it may be the problem with hardware when it got built. This xs phone I returned also had screen issues (ghost typing/not recognizing my typing) and continued to get worse and started to try self deleting my apps or liking/disliking posts/youtube videos, etc. but really great to have long return guarantee period. It was a beautiful phone…</br>",2021年9月3日 在美国审核

Horrible,Phone overheated multiple times to the point where it burned my hand. Phone repeatedly shut off by itself or completely froze. Phone became so hot that it shattered inside of its own case which was an otter box! Worst of all they will not send you a new phone until you sent this one back first. Not everyone has the money to just buy another phone on a wim. And for people who rely on their phone for gps or work- going without a phone is not an option. Horrible experience!,2021年1月12日 在美国审核

Best Amazon buy yet!,I was Leary buying a renewed phone but was more than pleasantly surprised. The phone arrived totally unblemished and was just what I was looking for and was the right price. Setting up the phone which was a Verizon locked phone took only 15-20 minutes. Everything from my iPhone 7 was transferred first. I then installed the SIM card removed from the 7 and basically it was up and running.All of my worst fears never came true at all. The phone was totally wonderful and was exactly what was ordered. Looks feels and acts like a brand new iPhone XS.,2019年12月1日 在美国审核

Overall a great purchase,"So I ordered the iPhone XS unlocked and overall I have no complaints about the phone itself. It is in great condition, has no scratches or marks, battery at 85%, and works well. My sim card was recognized and works (I have safelink wireless which is the Obama phone lol nad its through Tracfone which I think is through Tmobile) The only issue I have is that I can't create an Apple ID because it says too many IDs have been created on this phone. My apple ID is attached to an old phone number from years ago and it is gonna take 10-14 days to verify my new number since I no longer have access to that device or number. So I would suggest verifying a new number ahead of time if you have the same issue. I cant use the app store, facetime, iMessage, or anything so it sucks, but I will update my review once I get that all in order. All in all, I recommend this phone, great purchase and worth every penny!<br>**EDIT** so I realized I could create an Apple ID on my computer then sign in on my phone with it until my other ID verifies.I did, however, have issues with iMessage and FaceTime being verified.I spoke with apple and Apparently since this phone has had multiple numbers, they marked my phone number as spam. They were able to fix it in a single phone call. Hope this helps someone.</br>",2021年8月27日 在美国审核

Poor screen replacement done on phone.,The phone came looking really good besides around the camera the ring had some buffs also some dust and dirt in the openings. The battery capacity is 88% but it drains a little faster than id like even with low power mode especially considering the price. The screen isnt the original apple screen which I wouldn't mind as long as it was a decent replacement and maybe OLED? the connectors might have an issue because the screen glitches and blacks out while the phone is on. Also no sim tool provided and the sim tray was sorta stuck in the phone. Not terrible overall but im not thrilled considering the price.,2021年3月1日 在美国审核
"It almost like new, except the battery","This is my second time I tried renewed.The first one was iPad Pro that really, really like unused item.I don't expect that high when I buy this. As a phone it is hard to believe people don't actually use it and then sell it.Come out it is kind of what I expected. The phone itself is almost perfect, the screen, no scratch. If you don't check you will gonna believe it is an opened new phone. It comes with usb cable and iphone charger, both look like the original things.The only, really problem is the battery.I got my one at health 81%.Almost reached the unacceptable margin.There are somethings I can work around it. I upgrade from my dying 6s+ so even in 81% in this Xs, the battery is ""still last much longer"".Change battery is a regular running cost nowadays.So it this is not acceptable to you, stay away from renewed, especially for the stuff that people actually use, like phone.",2020年1月1日 在美国审核

I would definitely deal with these guys again minus the customer service issues.,2021年2月19日 在加拿大审核
Super recomendable.,"iPhone XS con estética 10/10, Batería 100% aun, todo funcional con las piezas originales, podría recomendar a""WirelessWarehouse USA"" que fue la empresa con la que lo adquirí.El celular viene con una caja genérica no muy estética pero lo que cuenta es el celular , un cargador y un cable certificados.Muy satisfecho con la compra.",2021年1月13日 在墨西哥审核
Satisfecho con el teléfono,"El teléfono llegó en perfecto estado, con un cargador, llave para la SIM y una tarjeta con un código QR para comunicarme con el comprador en caso de ser necesario. No tiene ninguna raya, ni en pantalla ni en el vidrio de atrás. La batería está al 84%, pero la duración de la carga es como si tuviera 90% (la batería de mi iPhone anterior duraba mucho menos estando en el mismo porcentaje). Sólo tiene un pequeo ""defecto"": a veces la pantalla no responde en el borde derecho, cuando quiero escribir la p o la , por ejemplo, pero no es un gran problema porque después de un rato funciona de nuevo (o puedo girar la pantalla). En definitiva, una gran compra.",2021年12月4日 在墨西哥审核
Producto reacondicionado que parece nuevo,"A ver, hay que leer bien la descripción, se trata de un producto reacondicionado que podría tener algunos detallitos. en mi caso cumplio al 100% lo que dice en la descripción y excedió mis expectativas. el teléfono se ve como nuevo, no trae ningun detalle y fuera de la capacidad de batería que no es nueva, no te darías cuenta de que se trata de un teléfono usado.Los accesorios genéricos funcionan de maravilla y viniendo del mundo iphone a estas alturas ya tengo muchos cables y cargadores.Así que el veredicto es 100 por 100 recomendable el ahorro contra uno nuevo fue más de un 30% y no siento ninguna diferencia",2021年4月12日 在墨西哥审核
It works as expected,"The package came early, the Iphone worked as it should. Although I was a little underwhelmed by the lack of contents on the inside. I thought I was scammed at first by the lack of design on the box and contents. It was just a blank box with a charging cable and the phone itself. Not quite the satisfying unboxing experience but my main focus was the iphone which worked great for me.",2021年7月15日 在加拿大审核

Great quality and no visible damage,"I was a doubtful at first and I did not want to purchase a refurbished product due to generally mixed reviews but I am very happy with this product and I’ve been using for about a month, it arrived on time and as soon as I opened it I checked for any visible damage or used marks. There are none at all.Got it from seller “Big Box LLC”It didn’t arrive with the original iPhone box as expected but it came with what seems to be its original cable and wall plug, which surprised me, I was expecting a generic accessory.The battery life quality is at 80% as expected and the phone was properly factory reset, there was no iCloud lock or anything.I already put a screen protector as seen in the picture and it runs smoothly.Great and noticeable generational jump from an iPhone 7, totally recommend it.",2022年6月22日 在加拿大审核

No se apaga, no tiene problemas de ningún tipo. Siento que hice una muy buena compra en cuanto al celular. Lo malo fue el cargador. Tuve que cambiarlo porque desde que se conectaba constantemente marcaba error de conexión.

Excelente compra a excelente precio.,"Hay muchas cosas por decir respecto al teléfono celular. Como a la mayoría de gente, el IPhone XS venía en una caja genérica junto a un cargador no original. Dejando eso de lado, el teléfono supero ampliamente mis expectativas. No todos los compradores tienen esta suerte, pero parece ser que al menos con esta empresa suelen ser más las buenas que las malas. El teléfono venía con 100% de capacidad de batería, sin ningún tipo de rayón, y básicamente en estado de nuevo. Las bocinas funcionan perfectamente, las cámaras también, y el rendimiento es como de teléfono recién salido de fábrica. Desbloqueado para usar con cualquier operador, y sin ningún problema de cuentas de apple o similares. Es cierto, comprarlo renovado no es para todos. Siempre se recomendará comprar el teléfono nuevo cuando la posibilidad existe, pero esta compra en definitiva ha sido de las mejores que he hecho cuando de un teléfono se trata. Hay motivos para arriesgarse a comprar acá. PD: Esta fue mi experiencia, no necesariamente será la de todas las compras de este tipo, pero a más común sea el dispositivo, más chance de que salga bien. El IPhone XS ha envejecido como buen vino.",2022年6月14日 在墨西哥审核

"Ganas mucho o pierdes mucho, tu decides","Compré dos negros de 256 GB, uno salió muy bien y otro salió malEl que salió bien no ha tenido ningún problema hasta ahora, incluso se cayó desde un buró de ropa y no hubo problemaEl otro celular parecía que tenía una batería defectuosa porque no duraba nada la carga, estuve a punto de devolverlo pero como la pantalla, bocinas, micrófono y de estética estaba como nuevo, decidí ver hasta cuando podría aguantar antes de que eso me volviera loco; y resultó que con sólo una calibración de batería fue suficiente para que tuviera una duración aceptable, PEEEERO después empezó a suceder la razón de que me metiera a subir esta resea, el celular se me apagó de la nada una vez (probablemente ya pasado el tiempo de devolución), y desde entonces, de vez en cuando se apaga solo, lo correcto sería decir que se crashea y se reinicia y es MUY molesto y frustrante (y todo por andar comprando más barato).Así que, yo recomiendo que mejor te compres uno nuevo o directamente desde Apple Refurbished y así no te preocupas de nada, sabes que no estarás siendo estafado ni de un lado ni del otroO si tienes buena suerte, arriesgate y cómprate uno de estos, como dije, uno de los que compré está como nuevo y sin ningún problema de momento(No subo fotos porque qué flojera xd)",2021年3月23日 在墨西哥审核

Battery health was at 84%. I would've liked it to be a bit higher, but it did have the minimum of 80% battery health. The phone came in a generic white box with a charging cord and wall plug. The phone also arrived earlier than expected.<br><br>Pros: Very good condition with minimal scratches. Arrived early.Cons: Barely reaching the 80% battery health minimum as advertised.

Relatively good.,"June 2022 update:The phone has stopped working entirely, it seems to be a hardware issue regarding the logic board. There were no noticeable issues leading up to its failure, and I wouldn’t say it’s gone through anything other than a short fall. I can’t remember the battery capacity, but I don’t think it needed servicing just yet. I’m disappointed that it didn’t even last for two years, though I can’t say this is reflective of all Renewed products. I would be hesitant to purchase again.August 2021 update:The battery percent is still 86%, there seems to be no burn-in. The OLED is highly enjoyable especially with black dark modes. The more recent OLED iPhones are much more expensive and the upgrade to an 11 is minor, so a pretty good deal!February 2021:The Renewed description is quite accurate, although and understandably, small scratches are still noticeable at arms length. Unfortunately, there is a small scratch on the camera lens with two very small cracks, though there are no problems with the camera. My iPhone XS has 86% battery capacity which is fine. Aside from the scratch, it looks and runs fine, I assume it’s the luck of the draw regarding any minor defects.Please pardon the screen protector and case in the photos, but there was really only one other small scratch aside from the one on the lens.",2021年2月20日 在加拿大审核

La pila no vino original y el touch se traba. Lo regresaré.,"La fecha de llegada y el embalaje BIEN pero el primer mensaje que salió cuando terminé de configurarlo fue que la batería no podía ser leída por no ser original. Al haber hecho investigación previa, sabía que es super común reemplazarlay que en general la batería se acaba rápido así que decidí quedarmelo y probarlo a pesar que la descripción dice: ""Este producto tendrá una batería que supere el 80 % de capacidad en comparación con uno nuevo"". En mi opinión la vida de la batería creo que es corta. Mi tiempo en pantalla es de 3-4h al día en redes sociales (poco cámara, cero juegos u otras apps) y al final del día se apaga.Su funcionamiento no es MALO, la cámara -que era de las razones principales por la que lo compré- funciona bien y por eso le di 3 estrellas, sin embargo a una semana de poco uso en general, me he dado cuenta que el touch se traba en casi todas las esquinas. Además de que me ha crasheado Whatsapp dos veces al mandar audios y me sale un mensaje diciendo que reinicie la app.El teléfono en general me gustó salvo por esos dos problemas que considero importantes y por lo tanto lo regresaré.",2022年6月25日 在墨西哥审核

The box says only ""Lumia 635"" using an improbable font and background color, without the usual Nokia or Microsoft logo or copyright disclaimers. The user manual is a poorly done scan of the original, and effectively unusable.If your moral is fine with supporting companies that abuse consumers and adopt such practices in the name of profit and greed, then the phone itself is a good bargain and mine came unlocked. BTW, those companies include in this case the Amazon reseller, and Amazon itself..I am going to return it as I don't want to be an accomplish in fraud.",2015年9月5日 在美国审核

It was unlocked but the ringer volume was very feeble and no one had mentioned about it in the reviews. I could barely hear it when it was like 2 feet away from me and i also tried adding different ringtones but it was of no use. I feel the ringer volume is an important feature in a phone as i would miss many calls even if the phone is next to me so i would give this phone 2 stars.

Don't waste your time and money.,"I have recently purchased three Nokia Lumia phones. One 530 and two 635's. I have had nothing but problems with all three. The 530 would not charge and would not boot. After finally getting advice from Microsoft, a master reset solved the problem. As for the two 635's, inserting the NANO Sim into the adapter and into the sim slot is VERY difficult. So difficult that I broke a sim connection prong in the process. Seating the Nano sim into the adapter is not easy and not always successful. That phone is now a paper weight. The second 635 would not charge, would not boot and repeated attempts at a master reset never worked. It showed signs of executing the reset but it never worked. I returned it for a refund.So, my experience with Lumia phones has been a disaster. I would not recommend this phone. The cheap price is not worth it. This is no bargain!",2015年9月23日 在美国审核

Junk!,"Awful experience with this phone.Right out of the box battery was inert, so I charged it fully overnight after inserting it in the phone using it's own branded charger and cord.Upon turning ON the phone it immediately displayed a Lightning Bolt and Cog.I did a bit of research and did the reset procedure vol dn, + power sw + camera buttons.It vibrated, I released the power button and the phone came up.Intermittantly it would drop into the Lightning Bolt/Cog business and require the reset procedure.Eventually I got to the update screen and saw there were updates available, so update it I did.Upon resetting itself after the 4 updates were completed it once again gave the Lightning Bolt/Cog screen and was non-responsive to the reset routine that previously worked.I removed the battery, removed the sim and extra memory card and allowed it to sit for an hour while I gathered more info from the net.Upon reassembling the battery, sim and mem card it powered on but did not respond to touch at all.I gave up at this point of that day and began to repeat all of this the next day...several times.What an awful piece of junk this phone was/is.I returned it to Amazon for a refund.",2015年4月5日 在美国审核
I love this cell phone,"I love this cell phone, for the price that i paid for it and the functionality i needed from it is just fantastic. They reason i bought this cell phone is because what i really use it for mainly is for phone calls and text messaging, i dont run a online business or a big Facebook page on this phone but it is still very much capable of that. If there was any complaints from we for this phone would be that there has been some slip ups once or twice, for example a mobile game i had on my old iPhone before switching was Hill Climb Racing. For some reasons shortly after installing the game it would kick me off the game while using it. I don't know if that was my cell phone or the app but after i uninstalled it it never happened again. One thing that i absolutely LOVE about the Nokia Lumia 635 is the battery saver function, its nothing new and lots of phones have but the amount of battery this phone saves is insane. That functionality has three options, off, when battery is under 20% and always on. If i were to had it fully of i have 8 hours flat, if i use the under 20% option it does a bit of battery saving even before the 20 % and gives me a bit over 2 extra hours. And if you have it fully on it gives me 4 extra hours. I recommend this cell phone to anyone that is looking for a new phone but what i don't recommend is buying it from this seller, i bought mine from Walmart for 49.99 so 130.00 is way over priced.",2015年11月2日 在美国审核
Best value for a high quality phone,"It is an excellent phone at a very reasonable price, thanks to subsidy by Microsoft. It is slightly bigger than iPhone 6 but at one tenth of the cost. It does most things you want on a smart phone flawlessly. Battery life is amazing. If you love YouTube, it is better than iPhone because you can easily down load YouTube videos and watch them on airplanes. The podcast function is better than Android as you don't have to buy an app to receive podcasts. The camera is quite decent as well.A couple of things to watch out for: Do not get a GO phone. It is locked. Unlocking it is impossible. Make sure you buy an unlocked phone. Selection of apps is more limited than either iPhone and Android. If you have a tablet with either IOS or Android, you have both covered.",2015年12月31日 在美国审核

All the apps are terrible on this phone and crash like crazy. The phone is so slow and sometimes will crash into a black screen and then sit their so you have to reset it by taking out the battery and putting it back in. Will never ever purchase a windows phone again and anyone reading, trust me its not good at all for a budget phone. You're better off putting out a little more money on a phone that is reliable and actually has apps and wont crash on you. Since this phone has no apps, its virtually = to a flip phone.

"The Lumia 635, an ultra-reliable Windows phone with great features. Thoroughly recommended.","UPDATE July 2019. Microsoft no longer supporting this phone, so WhatsApp won't work. Great shame, it's a nice simple and reliable phone, but now need to buy two new (Android) phones.This is our second Lumia 635. We still have the first, its about two and half years old now and still working absolutely perfectly. This second phone is for my wife. She had an Android before, but neither of us could get on with the over-complex home screen and operating system. (Update in June 2018 - our original phone is now four and a half years old! And still working perfectly.)The Lumia 635 runs Windows 8.1 - and its a total joy to use. Its so intuitive, easy and thoroughly logical. And the great things is - when you have two Windows phones, and Windows 10 PCs and laptops - all your contacts are automatically synchronised. Phone numbers, addresses, email addresses the same, immediately, on all devices. Its the perfect solution.UPDATE (June 2018). Windows 8.1 is still the latest Microsoft version of Windows for Phones. So this phone is still 100% current. Its still runs the latest version of WhatsApp too.One minor negative is Internet Explorer. Its too slow and bulky. I installed the Opera app which is MUCH faster and uncluttered. I recommend anybody to do the same.The phone has a USB port so I can transfer all my data to a computer, and the Nokia Suite app for Windows PC lets you manage the phone features too.Reasonable number of apps available for Windows too. And the Lumia 635 is a solid, well made phone that has lasted the course.Thoroughly recommended, and would definitely buy again. And if you also own a Windows PC or laptop, a Windows phone is the logical choice. Microsoft have really got the integration sorted. In fact I would not buy another Android - Windows is far better.",2016年12月6日 在英国审核
Give it a go.  You won't regret it!,"Really happy with this phone.Have always used Android until now but thought I'd give this a go as the write ups andreviews were good,I wasn't disapointed. It's a nice size, looks good and works well.It's really easy to set up as from the moment you switch on it takes you through all the stages including emails and contacts.There's also loads of features built in that make it a really useful piece of tech and all the time it's really easy to use.If your using windows on your PC then this is just an extension of that and works well when connected to your PC.The only criticism such as it is, is it lacks a ""Silent"" button, you have to turn the volume down to put it on silent.I minor detail really. It's said that there isn't the number of apps available compared to IOS or Android but so far I managed to find all the apps I need.To sum up, if like me you don't want to be yet another zombie with an Apple phone or you fancy a change from Android then this is the phone for you.I can highly recommend.One more thing, a major feather in a very nice hat, you don't have to worry about viruses as apparently there aren't any (Yet) for window phones.Food for thought.",2015年10月16日 在英国审核

Really nice phone :-),"I'm really liking this phone.I'm changing over from a HTC Wildfire (which is probably 3-4 years old now) and don't have a lot of experience of smartphones, so this review won't be particularly technical!Things I like:- it starts up very quickly- Word Flow typing and its predictive text are really good - very few errors, esp. compared to what I am used to.- graphics are very fluid, sliding from one screen to the next is almost pleasurable!- I like the calendar - easy to use and view.- it's a Nokia!Always liked the regular Nokia phones - hard-wearing and intuitive to use.I'm pleased Nokia are getting up to speed with Smartphones.- I like the sound and picture quality when streaming (I've only used over WiFi not mobile internet).Things I think Nokia/Windows could improve:- Available Apps.There are a lot of apps out there, but there are a few that I haven't found, e.g. ColorNote (although Office's OneNote is coming in handy as a replacement).Of course, this may not actually be down to Nokia/Windows but the people who actually develop the apps.- I think the settings menu could be tidied up a little.- The phone doesn't have a flash...but most photos seem to come out OK.I suppose it depends on the environment, and ultimately, if you are used to a phone that is just a phone, you will still be pleased with the camera.Camera is easy to use.- Both this phone and the previous smartphone I have used need the phone to be switched on for the alarm to work.I loved the days when I could save battery life by switching the phone off at night yet still knowing the alarm would go off.I have a feeling this is true of all smartphones and I guess it's to do with everything being an ""app"" these days, but it would be nice if there was some way of getting the alarms to work when the phone is off (I'm sure there is such a way!).I'm used to using Alarm Clock Xtreme, which has a lot of settings for snoozing, etc (terrible habit, I know!).Can't find the app for this phone, so am using the standard alarm.Snooze time is 10 min.Things I've worked out that maybe, like me, not everyone will know when moving to this phone:- to take a screenshot, press both side buttons simultaneously (I'd never known how to take screenshots on a phone before)- to customise your Home screen, press on a tile and they all begin to 'float'.You can remove, change the size and move tiles to suit your needs.To add a tile from your apps list, press down on the app entry and then select Pin to Start.- Quite a few of the pre-installed apps (which more often than not I tend to find aren't necessary for my use) can be uninstalled.I don't know if they are truly uninstalled or just go hiding somewhere, but it helps to reduce the number of apps I have to scroll through on my app list.- hold down the &lt;- arrow to view all the windows you have open.At first I was annoyed that I couldn't, say, come out of a google search without having to repeat the search...then I discovered this function!Not the tidiest of reviews, I admit, but I hope this helps people who are moving over to the Nokia Lumia models.I'm really pleased I have made the move, and really like this phone.For the price, I don't think you could expect more really (I've seen the cost of higher spec models and iphones, etc.!) - this phone does a hell of a lot and nicely too :-)I guess these days, mobile phones are less about being phones and more about being everything you need whilst on the go!EDIT - forgot to say, it doesn't come with a USB cable if you want to connect to PC - I haven't got that far yet!I paid £119 on 12/09/14.Arrived on SUNDAY (!) 14/09/14.Great delivery service.Was sold by Amazon when I purchased.",2014年9月16日 在英国审核

Simplicity and reliability,"I have had a Nokia 635 for about two years; I bought the current one for my wife, who has never used a mobile phone.It was good to have two identical phones (although this one has some differences in software).She didn't want one that was too complicated, and is finding it straightforward to use.The important point is that it does what it says on the tin; not much in the way of frills, Windows 8.1 isn't the most exciting operating system, but who cares?It does what I expected and what we both need.Quite quick (4G), we don't often lose signal, and it just keeps on doing what we ask of it.Very cheap too, for what it offers.Good battery life: a friend has one of another make, and he has to carry a top-up battery, because it won't run for a day.Not so the 635; even after a day of texting/emailing, looking up things on the internet, it is usually still around 40%charge.If you aren't worried about all the latest bells whistles and frills, I can recommend this phone.If you want the latest and greatest, well, it's not for you.",2018年9月30日 在英国审核

Screened,"This has been a reliable and robust phone which I use mostly for checking work emails and for sat nav. I say robust because my 1 year old son has taken a shine to it and as a result it has been dropped numerous times. The back usually pops off but snaps back on easily enough.Obviously I do use it as an actual phone sometimes and for this it is fine, although it does seem to get pretty hot against the ear. Sound quality is normal.Battery life seems comparable with other phones but I do have most apps switched off which helps. Probably needs charging every day but I think that is how things are now with smartphones.The camera is not great and is quite slow. There is no flash which is a shame. It's OK for snappy snaps though. Storage seems OK but again I do make a habit of deleting things. The function to upload photos automatically to One Drive is useful/very useful.WiFi and browsing seem OK but it does struggle with certain newpapers' websites for some reason. It's not super fast.Email usability seems good and I use it on Outlook and Yahoo mail. Both work well.The sat-nav is characteristically excellent and is another reason why I keep getting Nokias (now Microsoft).The only other app I really use a lot is Audible which works well. The sound quality is pretty tinny but one expects that for the price.Overall a very good value 'phone that does the job I need it to do.",2015年7月21日 在英国审核

I have an iPhone 4s which I use for work and wanted something else for personal use.The 635 is a perfect size; slim and lightweight with great graphics and a vivid color display which is better than the iPhone (in my opinion) in direct sunlight. I like the fact that I can individualize the home screen and have an up to date basic view of all applications (email, calendar and social media etc) without having to open each of them individually. The camera produces good quality pictures and has some nice options for shooting in different modes/scenes.Battery life is very good for a smart phone. It can survive a full day of pretty heavy usage and charges fairly quickly too.My only gripe (and I'm picking to be constructive) is that it's not quite as responsive as my iPhone. Some of the applications take a second longer to load and there is no front camera, which in all reality, I never use anyway!Overall, excellent value for money.",2015年1月4日 在英国审核

My biggest gripe (apart from the obvious lack of certain apps - notably catchup TV - RTE here in Ireland (not sure about BBC iPlayer?) is the lack of a front-facing camera - even basic doid tablets have this and given it's 4g-ness it seems an odd oversight because the res tells you you are mostly going to use this for social and email. Bit of bonus is HERE maps - which I believe has turn-by-turn gps-asssisted navigation - from that point of view and as a hotspot it's worth the money. Personally I sent it back and headed for the 735 - which is notably snappier and has front-facing camera - it is however substantially dearer (not silly dear compared to 'smart' phones (honestly I think android is terrible!)) but a bit more futureproof - I anticipate this living in the glovebox as a GPS/media device and 4g hotspot for the next few years - things you could also do with the 635 come to think of it..!",2014年10月30日 在英国审核

I've got 2 now!,"Great value Windows smart phone. Easy to set up and use. I bought mine from RMA Technologies, which was fulfilled by Amazon. Brand new in original packaging. Comes with basic instructions in English, battery, earphones, USB charger. It needs a micro SIM. I also put a 16GB micro SD in mine. It has 8GB on board storage (where the OS is), and can take up to 128GB extra. The operating system takes you through all the steps to set it up (in English). It's Windows 8, and when you go online it will automatically download the 8.1 update. You can then tweak all your apps and personal settings to your taste. I did find that the keyboard settings, and the speech for Cortana were set to Spanish, but all you need to do is change them to English. (The speech had to download, which you then need to tap to install, and then restart the phone). It cannot upgrade to Windows 10 due to the hardware limitations.

mostly ok,"Update 12/30/17:After a little over 2 years, I've pretty much come to the end of the product's useful lifespan.I've been deleting apps for months, just to be able to keep the core functions updated.Now,however, I can't even do that. A couple of updates ago, Firefox was no longer able to move to the sd card &amp; that was rely the beginning of the end. I'd not have loadedthat app, but about a year ago (I. guessing), HTC stopped supporting the browser the phone came with, so I had to go get anew one.Really stupid, IMHO.Anyway, the only other serious issue I found was that the camera is *terrible* in even moderately low light conditions. The video is even worse. Otherwise, I've found both to be pretty good, especially for the price.I'm actively looking for a replacement, but so far VM doesn't have much I'm interested in, without spending a boat-load of money. I don't intend to accept a downgrade of any of the features, but I can't afford $500 for a new phone. So the search continues...I've only had this phone for about a day &amp; a half, so I may update this review as I learn more about the product.So far, I like it.I don't love it, but then, it's just a phone.I still miss one of my old flip phones from many, many years ago that, ironically, cost about the same as this one (roughly $150).It had the best reception of any cell I've ever used, bar none.The camera was excellent, considering how long ago it was.The phone was extremely durable as well, and had I not dropped it just one too many times &amp; dislodged the camera lens, I'd likely still be using it.In any case, this HTC is my first personal smart phone.I've previously had an iPhone 4 &amp; 5C for work.The 5C was an 8GB model, so I find this HTC phone to be fairly comparable, with one huge difference: the screen size.I've got small hands, but haven't had any issues with this monster yet.It has taken a bit of getting used to, but I find that to be the case with any new item, when you're used to something else.I've had more ""trouble"" getting used to the android way of doing things than with handling the phone itself.But again, that's just from being completely unfamiliar with the android product line.I do look forward to seeing what it can do.It's a bit less intuitive than Apple's OS, but I do have to say that when I first started using the iphone 4 for work, I wanted to throw it out a window at least once a day.We eventually reached a truce, however, and I'm hoping it will be the same with the HTC.First impressions:It's big.Not so big that it won't (mostly) fit into a pocket, but it's quite a jump up from a 4"" screen.I'm attaching a pic of the two phones for size comparison.The HTC will definitely stick out lengthwise from a back pocket.The ringtone choices are limited &amp; pretty sad, but you're able to record your own, so I likely will do so.As others have said, it's got 8GB of storage, and about half that is taken up by pre-loaded software.That seems pretty standard, however, and I'd already planned to pick up an SD card to increase space sooner rather than later.That's not an option with the 5C (or any iphone), so that's a point in this phone's favor.Call clarity is ok, but not nearly as good as either iphone.It's really only about as good as my current VM flip phone, which is at least 5 or 6 years old, maybe more (",2015年11月5日 在美国审核
CANT UPDATE APPS,"I've had this phone for over a year and I can't update any apps anymore because the internal storage is full.

Even if you move apps to an SD card, they automatically move back to your phone's internal storage when they update. The most I can do is have photos I take with the camera saved to it. I have a 60 gig SD card that is mostly empty because I can't install apps to it! There is tons of bloatware that clogs up the 5 gigs of internal storage you do get. At this point I haven't updated most apps in over 6 months and I have to run a cleaning app every time I want to update something just to see if I can make enough room. Had to uninstall Instagram and Facebook just to update Snapchat. If I want to install anything new I'll have to uninstall Twitter or Spotify. This phone is no good.",2018年2月22日 在美国审核
Lack of Memory BIG Dissappointmnet!,"Purchased this phone because of the great reviews but it was a big disappointment. It does have a great screen size for watching Youtube and playing games. My son really enjoyed that. It takes great pictures and videos and they come out crisp and bright. It also has great speakers and we enjoyed lots of Amazon music on it. However I could not really use the speakers when talking on the phone. People could not hear me clearly and the phone would cut out lots of the conversation. A big annoyance because you would have to hold the phone the whole time and can't do anything else. I also found the placement of the power buttons and the volume buttons on the left top side to be really inconvenient. I don't have big hands at all and I was consistently turning off my screen. It caused me to lose lots of great photo ops the worse one being the shot of my son receiving his First Holy Communion! The deal breaker for me is the incredibly low memory storage this phone has. Most of the memory is taken up by useless apps that come with the phone and you can't get rid of them. I have only been able to download three apps and there is no more storage left! I am constantly moving stuff to my SD card but they keep ending up back in internal storage. I disabled some of the preloaded apps, i blocked updates and I am constantly having to clear the cache but it is a never ending struggle because it has to be done so often. I was without my Messenger app for a while because there was not enough memory to update it! The memory issue with this phone is such a disappointment that I cannot recommend it for purchase and I really want to give it two stars for the frustration it causes!",2018年6月6日 在美国审核
Solid phone for 4 years,"With a new phone purchase looming on the horizon, this seemed like a great opportunity to look back on this phone of mine.I bought this back in 2015 when I switched to Virgin Mobile and it has been a solid phone for all that time.Pros:-Size, while initially seeming a bit large, grew on me and I was never want for more screen space.-Speakers are quite good by cell phone standards-Sturdy, I have dropped this phone multiple times over the past 4 years and it's still working just fine.No screen breakage or anything.-Main camera is still great even by today's standards.It's understandably going to be outclassed by Google Pixels, Galaxy S9/10s, and whatever new iPhone out there, but that's not to say that it doesn't still take good photos.-In-camera photo editing software is quite good and satisfied my needs.-Call quality was always more than fine.Any issues regarding cell service or cell coverage would be a fault of the carrier, Sprint (ie. Virgin Mobile), and not this phone.Cons-Bluetooth connectivity completely failed about 6 months ago.Despite my best efforts, this phone will no longer connect to any bluetooth devices.-Headphone jack somehow got ""stretched out"", no longer securely holds headphones.I can still connect my headphones or earbuds to the phone and the audio works just fine, but even the lightest pull will pull out the headphone cable from the phone.-Internal storage in this phone is a joke.Box said 8GB, but bloatware will give you only about 4-5GB.This has resulted in an almost comical juggling of apps on my phone, trying to decide which ones to keep, which ones to delete, and which ones to allow to update.-Android updates, as expected, no longer happen.Any sort of updates on this phone are a thing of the past.-Low-light/night photos, despite all of this phone's camera's strengths, it never really did well when it came to night photography.Too much noise for my liking.-Limited memory meant that programs and apps could get bogged down and slow from time to time.Don't expect all apps to open quick and snappy.-The phone's screen has begun to flicker every now and then (began about 6 months ago).It's not often, but occasionally I'll get a screen full of lateral static lines that appear to overlay and dim my screen.It's not elegant, but I've found a quick, firm knuckle tap to the back of the phone snaps everything back to normal.So all in all, this has been a solid phone.With age, it has gotten a bit long in the tooth and it's definitely showing its age now.But considering I bought this phone primarily to be a secondary camera for when I didn't want to carry around my DSLR, I'd say it did its job just fine.It made calls when I needed it to make calls, texts worked just fine, the camera filled my memory cards with great photos, and 4 years later it's still working and doing what I ask of it.",2019年11月12日 在美国审核
2 months in... great phone still.,"Too many good detailed reviews, so i will just post likes/dislikes.Likes:+Big good looking 5.5"" screen that still fits easily in my work pants/slacks.+Built in boom sound, zoe and visual equalizers with lyrics for your music.+Plays your mp3s from your burned cds, not just official mp3s bought online.+in general: good cameras, phone features and smooth operation.+Can transfer pics and video from your sd card to built in storage and vice versa at will(only about half of the 8gb of internal storage is usable though, but most of my music and videos are on the sd card anyway.Disclaimer: im not a heavy user of apps and i dont game on a phone)Dislikes:-very heavy usage means charging daily, and it doesnt exactly charge fast.But im usually able to charge every other day.-boom sound is good and loud close by, but it doesnt really sound that loud from a long distance to me.other budget phones ive had sound louder from a distance.-gets kinda hot with extensive usage on certain activities to the point where i added a widget that indicates battery temp.-phone still fits in my pants, shorts, etc.But im always worried it might break when i bend at work(manual labor).Not exactly premium materials used(but hey its a budget phone &amp; price at 180 with no contract)Anyway, your mileage will vary with above plus &amp; minuses.I bought at $180(wiped out $80 in amazon credit so it ended up only costing me $100), dont regret it at all.Months ago i was looking to upgrade to a 5"" sharp aquos but virgin mobile never made that available(us vm'ers get the short stick since we are 3rd in line behind sprint prepaid and boost i guess).But thats ok, im glad im ""stuck"" with this phone.And at the rate virgin is adding new phones to its line up(which seems like forever), i would gladly buy another on sale as a backup or recommend this as an upgrade to anything but the s5.",2015年6月6日 在美国审核
"Only choice for VM for low price high specs...BUT, problems ensue.","**Firstly, this is the only choice you have for high specs and low price on virgin mobile. So there really is no reason to not get it.**Alright now that you accepted that fact lets state the flaws you wont notice right away and what makes me give this 3 stars after over a year of owning it. Keep in mind I have large hands (im 6'4'') so youd think i would like a bigger phone, right? Wrong.1. The actual screen to body ratio is pretty poor. Theres a large border around the screen, the speakers take up a lot of space, the stupid logo has its own row, and the navigation buttons are on screen which doesnt count as usable space. The screen seems MUCH smaller after realizing what you have to actually work with.2. I didnt think it would be a problem with the power button being above the volume buttons but i absolutely hate this. I mean HATE. Im not left handed so turning the screen on and off requires finesse with your pointer finger to not lose grip of the phone and throw it. Ive done this a lot and like i said before, i have large hands so i cant imagine an average sized person doing this without always using both hands to hold the phone and push the button. this sort of required finesse also applies to typing text with 1 hand, it wont happen.3. Camera is very poor and grainy in low light. Otherwise it is pretty standard.4. I previously owned a Samsung Galaxy S3 (also virgin mobile) and will say the colors on that phone blow this phone away. it was pretty underwhelming looking at this phone until i finally forgot what the s3 looked like.5. 8 gb internal storage with unremovable bloatware means hardly any real world storage space. After system updates, HTC sense junk updates, you will be scouring your phone for things to delete just so you can install the next major system update. My galaxy s3 had 16gb...how is this newer phone half the space?6. A general wrap-up on the size of the phone. Since the screen is 5.5 in, with a large bezel surrounding it the phone is much larger than youd think. i constantly drop or throw (like a bar of soap) this phone because it isnt practical to hold with 1 hand. Im sorry, im getting older and i feel dumb standing in 1 spot with both hands on the phone for everything i do like im in the 3rd grade staring at the davinci code trying to figure out a great mystery. This phone is just too damn large for how much usable screen space there is. Also, having this in my jeans pocket is very uncomfortable and i always take it out if i go out to eat.7. This is the biggest issue. The simm card slot on these phones is very poorly manufactured. After a few times of dropping the phone, the spring mechanism that ""snaps"" and holds your simm card in place will break. This causes the simm card to never be able to properly stay in the slot. bought a hard plastic slim case that sort of smashes the sim card into the slot and keeps it in place. So now i can never remove this crappy plastic case or else the simm card shoots out of my phone. This issue is well known if you look it up. I was going to repair it myself but the simm card assembly is contact soldered to the main board which requires a special heatgun. If you get any parts too hot your phone is perma fried. So now sometimes my internet just drops out and says ""cannot establish a wireless connection"" and i have to hold the upper right corner of the phone where the simm slot is to regain connection.7-2. So because the phone is too large, you drop it, simm card slot breaks. There is no amount of being careful in the world where you WONT drop your phone. it is inevitable.8. With the latest system software updates the phone now randomly has a restart loop (seems completely random but it happens on google maps a lot) and will lock up on the HTC logo screen. Unless you wait for your battery to die the only way to regain control of the phone is to rip the back of the ""non removable"" backing off. Then, with a tiny flat head screwdriver pry UP on the battery cables/pin that connect the battery to the power board. Push the connector back into the pins, and snap the backing plate back on. Power on phone. This problem actually happens a lot and is very random as to what causes it.9. Turn off location services unless you like a lot of errors popping up saying ""google everything has stopped working"" Turn on location services when you want to use GPS.That is the end of the review. I hope this helps with some people who do not want those ""star struck reviews"". This is a real world, normal person with a job account of the problems ive found over the last year+ with the phone.",2015年12月3日 在美国审核
No More Ridiculously Overpriced Smartphones! This One is Fine!,"Pros :-It's a phone that costs 129.00 and has no contract. A no brainer when you compare it to the Samsung Galaxy S4s my wife and I had that had to be replaced 2 times (that's both phones 2 times) because they had problems with thinking the SIM card had been removed and made you reboot them. Not something I want to be dealing with when I have to pay over $600 EACH. Factor in the insurance in case you damage them, if you try to use that insurance your Co-pay is still more than the cost of a brand new HTC Desire so why even bother? It's all just a scam to keep you paying ridiculously high monthly cell phone bills until the day you die. Making it worse my FORMER cell phone provider tried to make me pay 400.00 for one of the first 2 Galaxy phones we exchanged claiming charge port damage. Utter BS and I got that bill eliminated. Buying a phone outright and paying as you go is now the only plan I will ever be on.- It has front facing stereo speakers that sound quite nice, another advantage to that is those speakers make it easier to hear incoming calls and texts if you work in a noisy environment like I do.-You can put up to a 128GB SD card in for additional storage(unlike overpriced iPhone garbage and the newest Samsung products)-13MP rear and 5MP front cameras (720P on the Video, same as screen resolution)-EXCELLENT battery life, however charging takes longer even when I use a 2amp charger instead of the 1amp it comes with-It doesn't cost over 600.00 like samsungs and iPhones! Cons:- it doesn't have dual band Wi-Fi-if you can do without social media like I can, Facebook and Twitter are pre-installed and you can't get them uninstalled, you can turn them off but you can't recover the storage they are hogging up-only 160 character texting so longer texts will be split into multiple texts, not sure if it's because of the phone itself or if it's a Virgin Mobile thing-Non Removable battery. If I have to have it professionally replaced in a few years I've still come out far ahead $ wise compared to the prices of Samsung and apple products that are ridiculously overpriced IMO (you can still hold in power button to reboot if any apps lock your phone up)-Some would say 720P resolution is a con but if you think about it that is still a lot of pixels crammed into a 5.5 inch screen. In my opinion, it takes a much larger screen like at least that of a 32 inch lcd television before you really begin to notice differences in 720P and 1080POverall very happy with the purchase. The quad core processor keeps things moving quickly but I'm not one to put a lot of apps on my phone either, I use my Tablet for that",2015年12月29日 在美国审核
Downward Spiral disappointed,"Update: After owning this phone now 8 months I hate it! Today I noticed that my phone hadn't updated 18 apps. So being like a normal breathing human I went to update it only I couldn't. It only allowed me to update 5 apps before being informed that I was out of memory. This was after I had spent 20 minutes clearing out my cache and removing 3 apps. These are the basic apps that come with the phone and if the phone doesn't have the memory to even update it then what's the point of this phone even?! It's exhausting with this phone. Save your money and get a better one!!!I have enjoyed this phone for almost 2 months now. I thought coming from the Samsung S3 I wouldn't be able to adjust from the 4.8inch screen to the 5.5inch screen, that it would be too big. Once I got the phone though I never even noticed how much bigger the screen was. I feel in love with. The colors are bright and the picture is very clear. My only problem with the phone is that when in the sunlight the screen is hard to read. Its very washed out. Also the memory on the phone sucks. I bought a 32gb card to go with the phone but even after moving the apps that would let me move them to the card, I still only have 7.68gb left on the phone storage. That makes it hardto update the apps that need updated. Of course it's a Virgin Mobile phone so it's a lot of worthless apps I don't need.",2015年3月20日 在美国审核
2yrs old and still going strong. But wont hold a lot of apps.,I have had this phone almost two yrs now it is a great phone pictures where great but now are becoming blurry some days still good other days looks like I went from cold to hot and has a haze over them. touchscreen still in great shape no problems. Virgin Mobile apps that are pre program sucks can't get rid of them like you could on the older versions of their phones even with an SD card of any size it will only let you put some of the things on there internal space gets taken up very early and you cannot update. I have been able to do a system update and I am on a higher Android lollipop and it did give me some pictures in the camera Department like Photo Booth and split screen which are very cool I love this phone because it has dual front-facing speakers and is much louder than any of the other Virgin Mobile phones I have had in the past I am having trouble with the sync program but only in the last few months. overall with the 5.5 inch screen dual front speakers 13 megapixel camera in the back and five megapixel camera in the front I say that this phone is an overall great product from Virgin Mobile and Amazon originally paid $196 for it. I have been shopping around but cannot find a phone that had a 5.5 screen for the cameras today I found that the LG stylus 2 maybe what I am looking for cannot find information on speakers will not go back to a non dual speaker phone. I love playing Amazon music and watching videos and the speaker hands down beats any other phone I have owned.also I should say that if you are a gamer or like to have a lot of apps this phone is not for you.it comes with too much stuff created from Google that will not let you install it and it eats up a lot of the memory.,2016年6月25日 在美国审核
My Initial Thoughts On This Phone,"I've activated and been playing with this phone for the better part of the day, so my experiences so far may be 'incomplete' compared to how I may feel given some more time with it....but here goes:This is my first new phone in 3-4 years. My last phone was a crappy LG that sucked as far as anything internet was concerned....but for text/talk it was always solid and reliable pretty much anywhere I've been in the country, and I travel pretty regularly. Very sturdy as well. In fact, the only reason I purchased a new phone is because I had dropped the LG so many times over the years that the case wouldn't stay on. I literally had to Gorilla Tape it so that the case wouldn't fall off and the battery pop out. After about a month of looking at my raggedy-ass tape-phone...I decided it was about time. The other thing that kept me with the LG for so long is that not long after, I also purchased an IPod 5 to have a dedicated mp3 player and because it had a much better camera and was also very good for internet, as long as you were hooked to WiFi. So for the last several years I've carried both devices and would use the LG for calls/texts only (and for internet if I absolutely had to and had no access to WiFi), and would use the iPod for music, internet (WiFi only) and pictures. But after the LG started to fall apart I started looking at consolidating to one device without breaking the bank. That's where the Desire 816 came in.I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and outside sources....and it seemed that for the price this was the best bang-for-your-buck. I read through all the positives and negatives so that my expectations were realisitic and pulled the trigger. First impressions:The phone is pretty big. It's one of the larger phones out there...pretty comparable in size to the IPhone 6S. It seems like most phones are getting larger now days. Finding a decent, affordable, sub-5"" phone is pretty rare lately. Not sure I'm into this trend so much. And at 6"" and some change...the 816 is a biggie. Honestly though, the size has its advantages as well. Home screen and in-app viewing looks really solid and crisp. You're prettymuch relegated to 2-hand texting/typing unless you have huge hands, but the 'keyboard' is large and responsive.Unfortunately...so far I have not been impressed with streaming quality. I tried to watch Netflix on it through a strong WiFi connection at home...and the quality was pretty bad. Everything looked fuzzy and it took a long time to buffer, and then continued to interrupt my show and buffer afterwards. I 've never had this problem with the iPod 5. Things load quickly and viewing quality is damn-near, if not HD quality, and I've never had buffering issues. Video tends to load SLOW on the 816 and then not be very good quality. I will put it through it's paces a bit more...but so far I'm knocking points for it. It just seems pointless to have such a huge screen if it's going to look crappy during streaming playback where it would matter the most.Apps load snd respond quickly enough for average use...although again...the iPod 5 on the same WiFi connections performs much better/faster.One thing that I find absolutely criminal with a lot of these new phones is how little internal memory comes with it ...especially compared to what the manufacturer claims. This phone is claimed to have 8gb of internal memory. After unboxing and activating...and adding NO apps of my own at that point...I was left with about half of the internal memory left. The amount of bloatware on these new phones is ridiculous. When I say criminal ...I mean it. I can't believe it's even legal to advertise this way. I would start/join a class-action suit against this kind of BS if I could. Definitely knocking points for this travesty. But again...I had done my research and had heard others complain about this, so I made sure to order a 64gb SD card with the phone. Only problem....you can't load pretty much ANY apps to the card. You can put music and pics/video on it...but not much else unless you root the phone which I may very well do, which could possibly unlock a lot of potential power and perhaps fix some of these other issues. I'm debating going that route and will update this review if I do and it makes a major difference.Out of the box set up took a while. I wasn't timing it but it seemed to take about a half hour for the phone to run through all its initial updates and to walk you through a few basic set-up steps. I am not tech-savvy at all and was having issues getting the phone activated on my own, either thru VMs website or their automated phone system. I'm sure this is totally my fault. I got a rep on the phone and another 15 or so mins later we had my phone/internet/texting/voice-mail set up.I will say that the sound quality from the front-facing speakers is by far the best internal speaker sound-quality I've ever heard in a phone. No gripes there. I only made a couple quick calls to make sure the phone was working...but in-phone call-quality seemed acceptable if nothing special.Bluetooth worked fine when pairing the 816 to a pair of Phillips wireless headphones.Battery-life seems acceptable if not more so for now. I fully charged it earlier today and after messing with it for several hours I'm just now at 17%. I'm going to try running it almost completely down from a full-charge a few times and see if I can get a better idea. I'll update when that happens.Although the phone is large...it is thin and feels pretty good in-hand. One-handed operation is doable if you're not typing much. Like if you're just scrolling through Facebook or something of the sort.After only a day...I'm definitely a bit torn. I don't love the size...especially with the laggy and poor streaming quality. I abhor the amount of useless and memory-draining apps...and the fact that I can't move to SD or delete the vast majority of them. But I do feel that for the $150 price -tag (plus $25 for the 64gb SD card which is a must if you plan to have a lot of pics/music on this phone) you get a reasonably powerful and well-rounded phone. The crappy LG I mentioned earlier cost $100 3 or 4 years ago and wouldn't do a tenth of what this phone can.As of right now...I would mainly recommend this phone to someone that wants a solid smartphone at a reasonable price and won't mind the large size. Unfortunately for me...I feel like I will still be using my IPod the majority of the time when I have Wifi availability because it performs so much better with anything internet related. So consolidating to strictly one device like I was hoping seems to be unlikely for me at this point. That said...the internet service on the 816 is passable for casual use, so I won't feel the need to carry the IPod and a phone around as much as I used to. And as I mentioned before, the option of rooting this phone may be one that I explore. If that were to unlock the full-potential of this phone and make it run a little faster and free up some memory (and could possibly even help with some of the lag/video-quality issues)...this might just be an incredible handset for the price...if I can get past the large size. As it sits it's a solid if imperfect device...but I would still say it's a good value at the $150 price-point. Much more than that and I would be a bit more picky.****EDIT*****After using this phone for a month and a half now it's grown on me. I actually like the larger screen a lot more than initially did .The couple times I've used my iPod since this purchase, the screen on that device seems almost laughably small now. And speaking of...I really don't use the iPod at all anymore like I thought I would.The HTC is definitely a bit slower but not unacceptably so.I'm still pretty pisses about the lack of internal memory...and unfortunately all my attempts to gain root access have not worked. At this point for the price of this phone...the amount of unremovable bloatware is my biggest, and pretty much only real gripe anymore. I like this phone enough that when it recently became time to replace my wife's phone I ordered her one of these as well. She loves it.Updating my rating from 3 to 4 stars .",2015年10月3日 在美国审核
Too little internal memory and a big SD card won't fix it.,"I revised my review down from *** to ** after using it for a few weeks.The good: a nice big screen--and that's pretty much it.This phone does run Android Lollipop pretty smoothly, for whatever that's worth.I have not been impressed at all with the speakers even though they are supposed to be one of the phone's best features.Battery life is good if you use an app like Juice Defender but not so great out of the box.The bad: the low internal memory is a serious issue.There is so much crapware installed on this phone that you cannot get rid of unless you root that you will be lucky to put 20 apps on this thing before you start getting error messages from the Play Store because it no longer has enough memory to auto-update your apps--including all that crapware.Yes, you can add a large external Micro-SD card and move some apps to it but that isn't a real solution.Why?Well, 95% of apps can't be moved to it--mostly just games and some third party apps and when they get updated by Google Play they end up on the internal memory card again.Many apps also use memory from the internal card even if you run them from the external SD.I've got probably less than 30% of the apps on this thing that I had on my previous phone, a Galaxy S3.Many apps I paid for I cannot put on this phone because you are forced to prioritize brutally when there is so little internal memory.Then there are the updates.By my count there have been at least 4 updates between Android and HTC that forced my phone to reboot in the past 10 days, and I have no control over when they go through.The other day I was driving to an appointment using my Waze GPS when the screen went black.I thought the phone crashed, but then came the familiar Android is updating message and when my phone booted back up Waze GPS was no longer functional--the map was blank and it had no idea where I was.I switched to Co-Pilot GPS which stores maps on the device--and my map was gone and the app was acting like I was a new customer who had just installed for the first time.And this is all happening WHILE I AM DRIVING AND WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF USING THE GPS TO GET TO AN APPOINTMENT!!!!!!Maybe I was spoiled by the Galaxy but to me this is a seriously lousy phone, which was likely the reason Virgin Mobile stopped selling it after less than a year.If I had the money I would replace this thing tomorrow.",2015年9月12日 在美国审核
Amazing phone with a great price and only two problems!,"I'm going to start by saying that this is a wonderful deal for a high mid-range smartphone.The front of the phone features a beautiful 5.5 inch screen which definitely does not reflect the mediocre resolution and PPI. The colors and brightness have always been great for me. It also has two Boomsound speakers on the top and bottom which produce the best sound quality I've ever heard on a phone. It also has a 5 megapixel front facing camera which is very impressive and is great for video calls and selfies. The top of the phone has a 3.5mm headset jack to the right and a small hole to the left of it which sports the secondary microphone for noise cancellation. The left side of the phone has two buttons--the volume rocker and power--which I have not had any issues with though they're a little too high for my liking. The right side of the phone has a slot that pops out for inserting the SIM and SD card. It has two slots although one is locked and it supports up to 128 GB. The bottom side of the phone simply has a USB port. The back side of the phone is non removable with a 2,600 mAh battery which does not withstand benchmark tests. I get 8 hours out of it with moderate use, and 6 with constant heavy usage. It also has a 13 megapixel camera with LED flash which takes amazing pictures as long as it has enough light.When you turn the phone on, you see the stock lockscreen which I recommend replacing because it is not customizable and is not very safe considering you can just pull down the notification drop-down and change all your settings. You also see blinkfeed which I don't really think lives up to the hype unless you're seriously into social media and the news. It is more of a Google Now for HTC rather than an actual feature. The bloatware is considerably reduced compared to other phones I've tried. You will immediately notice Kid Mode in the settings but it is actually connected to a literally useless app called Zoodles stuck on the phone. There's also an ugly app called Key VPN which is pretty much only useful under certain conditions. After that, the only thing you have to deal with is the usual Google stuff on every Android. The only problem with this is that it takes up a lot of the already small 8 GB along with the system, leaving behind less than 4 GB available for the user.The actual OS--4.4 KitKat--is great with the smooth overlay of HTC Sense 5.5. Not to worry, you can quickly update to 5.0 Lollipop and Sense 6.0 in the software page. This phone has NFC and LTE both of which work fine. It is a Virgin Mobile phone and my experience with it has been good, except for when you first set it up and the app insists on completely resetting your homescreen and installing random apps. You can uninstall them thankfully.My only problems with this phone are the storage and battery. Otherwise, it's amazing and I recommend it!",2015年9月6日 在美国审核
It's great if you only want 1-2 apps and not a lot of pictures.,"I bought this phone December 2, 2014 for the price of about $200. I was very happy with it initially. I finally had a cool phone like everyone around me. No complaints except for the speakers could be louder.Now here in July 2016 and only about a year and half later I have to buy a new phone. I believe it was at the beginning of the year when suddenly my lg card or whatever it's called popped out and wouldn't catch anymore which was strange because I have only messed with it once maybe twice when I first got my phone. So I took it out and haven't had a problem until I started getting into google play and wanting to download some apps on my phone- CM Security, Shark Evolution, Zedge, Period Tracker, and I think that's it or there could be one or two more that I don't remember. I even bought a 32gb SD card so I could put everything that. Boy was I wrong. For the last 2-3 months now I have been without any space available even though I only have like 2 apps on there that won't move to my SD card. All the other space is the programs/apps that I don't even use or know anything about and some files from the Zedge app that I downloaded that if I took off then Zedge would be pointless. I was always having trouble updating apps due to the lack of space. I looked up ways to free up space and it some websites suggested to disable and clear cache of the apps that are not in use. So I go through and there's about 6 or so that I have no idea what they are for so I disable them and clear cache. Next thing I notice I have no network service at all. I can connect to the internet just fine but no Network. I don't have a good memory so I put a long of things in my calendar. Well I tried turning it off and on, re-starting it, but none of it worked. I contacted Virgin Mobile which after trying a couple of other things ended in the last resort of re-setting my phone completely and erasing EVERYTHING off if it. So reluctantly I did a factory reset and guess what...it FAILED. All day long my phone is still 'Activating' and won't connect to the network. So now I have to buy a new phone and I have lost all of my contacts, text messages, and info in my calendar, ugh.So basically if you want a phone that you can only have one or two apps and not take a lot of pictures, then this phone is for you. Otherwise look for a different phone with more internal space.",2016年7月23日 在美国审核
1st was brand new and had a dead pixel,"The phone itself is great BUT my phone seems to have a completely dead pixel on the bottom right. It was there right when I first turned the phone on. It's a black pixel and it's just so distracting and makes me like the phone less. I try to ignore it but since I know it's there I just keep staring at it. I love this phone though. I would gladly give this phone 5 stars if I'm able to get a replacement phone.October 25I got a refund and now I've reordered the phone. I hope that there is nothing wrong with this one. I really do love this phone but the dead pixel on ny first one was just so distracting. I'll update my review and rating (currently 2 stars) once I get the phone.October 27I got my new phone. It works perfectly fine. No dead pixels! This phone is just awesome.Now that I have a perfectly working phone I'll give my review.This phone is great for a mid-range smart phone. It does pretty much everything that a higher tech smart phone does. My friend has the Galaxy Mega and she has been playing with my phone a lot.I absolutely love the boom sound speakers. No more cupping my hand behind my phone on full volume just to try to hear a video. This phone pretty much has a mini surround sound.The cameras are really good. 13 mega pixel back camera and 5 mega pixel in the front. Yay for great selfies!This phone is user friendly...to me anyways. I've never had an HTC phone before and everything was easy to find and modify.If you want a big phone that is cheap (money wise) then this is the phone for you. I went from a 4 inch screen to this 5.5 inch screen and now my old phone looks super tiny. This phone never felt awkward to me though. I adjusted to it really fast.So far for me the battery had been really good. I took it to work at 5 am fully charged and with texting, phone calls, internet use I get home just after 6 pm and the battery was around 50%. Not bad. I do keep the screen dark most of the time though. My eyes work better with the darker screen.There are only a couple of things that I don't like about this phone.1) The amount of space this phone is very small. Only 8 gigs. Buy a micro sd card or use the one you have. I personally bought a 32 gig micro sd card for this phone.2) This phone is very lightweight and slick (due to the plastic back...also that is a finger print magnent). Buy a case if you can find one. They are very hard to find but they are there. I have a red one on mine.All in all this is a great phone...phablet...no regrets even though I did have to return the first phone due to a very distracting dead pixel that wasn't able to be fixed. So just beware when you buy an electronic device off the internet.",2014年10月18日 在美国审核
Highly recomended. love this phone.,"this was my first smart phone so take it as you will. i had this phone for 3 years. i used it every day. i am not the type to spend every minute on the phone so my battery drain is slower than most, but i actually could go 2 days without recharging. the screen never broke and everything looks and functions like it did on day one. that is with me never getting a screen protector. the only reason i upgraded the phone was because this phone only has 8 gigs of internal memory. you will find that that doesn't account to much since the phone uses nearly all of that to function. it also doesn't have a built in gyroscope so apps like pokemon go will not let you use the AR feature. another down side is that virgin mobile never released this phone to the new OS so you will be stuck with the OS built into the phone. all that said, i love this phone. i recently got a J7 refine, and i feel my old HTC handled several things better. if you can live without a lot of phone space and an old OS (honestly don't see much difference in the OS) this phone will not do you wrong.",2019年1月9日 在美国审核
Bought this phone 11 months ago. HTC update last summer ruined the phone!,"I've had this phone for almost a year. If I had written a review during the first 4 months I had it, it would have been a 5 star glowing review. But, as you can see, I had to give it two stars:Early last summer, HTC did a big automatic update. I called HTC immediately because out of the 8gb of memory, when I bought it I had almost 4g available. After the HTC update I had 400mb, not even .5 g left! And this was after uninstalling several apps that I couldn't move to my micro SD card! The HTC agentI talked to didn't see a problem at all. He said he has no problem working with 150 MB available on his own phone. Wow.I stayed calm and courteous. The agent said I could set my phone back to factory settings and I'd have the 4g back again! GREAT? No, he confirmed that the update is automatic so I would immediately be back where I started. So why did he even bring it up? I can't afford another phone, so I've been dealing with the pain ever since.**The HTC agent walked me through making it so all of the updates for my apps automatically go to my SD card, and he even lied and said the phone updates will go on the SD card too. lol. It was a line of bull to get me off the phone.**Updates on ANY app goes to the phone memory, and moves the app itself to the phone memory from your SD card! Then I have to go into the apps and manually move the app back to the SD card. This is a pain because I have to do this every few days with different apps!**I can't download any new apps because it will go on the phone memory before I can move it to the SD card! Even if I uninstall the apps that are in the phone memory that I can't move to the SD card: yahoo, calculator, and Virgin Mobile id pack (apps totaling 52.3mb), I still wouldn't have enough room for some apps!**I also have to go in and move pics I've taken and ones I've downloaded and edited from the phone memory to the SD card every few days.**Since the update last summer, about once every 2 weeks, I notice I'm not getting an texts, calls, etc for a day or two and have to turn the phone off and then on. I've never had to do this with a phone. I wish I could take a screen shot of the storage screen that shows 7.69gb is being used out of 8GB and the screen showing the only apps and data I have on there is less than 54MB. So you'd see it's all HTC software.I never had these problems with the LG phones I've used! My sister had a different model of HTC phone and said that's why she got rid of her's after a few months because she couldn't download apps. I chose this phone over a Samsung GalaxyS5 based on the reviews for both, my sister having had to replace her galaxy several times, the nice big screen, and the price. Many reviews said the HTC Desire 816 was better than the galaxy. Not after the update. I don't think I will ever buy another HTC phone again. I'm researching now for a better phone to finally purchase.",2016年1月10日 在美国审核
so it was fun to bring on the comments and discussion when I ...,"I have to preface this review by saying I was one of the last holdouts of a flip phone. Not just out of necessity, and cheapness, but also because I was proud of that flip phone. I work in the tech field, so it was fun to bring on the comments and discussion when I whipped that baby out and flipped it open. Especially as the screen had cracked a long time ago, and the glass was held in by tape. So did I really even want a smartphone? I am online all the time anyway, and it seemed like it was a huge time sucker, did I really need to be online more? Did i want to be like everyone else, sitting at dinner staring into my phone?Also I had a pay as you go on the flip phone and I hardly used it. The downside is everyone texts me, and I was paying for sending and receiving. It was only when I was walking down the street with my son and got a call, and to see his embarrassment, then when he wouldn't even take it when he was going somewhere, did the cracks in my flip phone pride begin to show. Also, having experienced the wonders of using Google maps in different cities, I was sold on the idea. It was just a matter of satisfying my frugal nature.So in short I had time to do a lot of research and decided based on many reviews of a variety of phones, that if I got one it would be the HTC 816. Read the reviews, most have legitimate points.-The battery to me seems ok. If I am home with stable wifi, it lasts for 2 days. While at work, presumably where it is searching it lasts for a whole day. I found turning off some things like Skype helped. There are battery saving options.-The sound is really good! Impressive actually for the size of the device.-I get the LTE signal most of the time. I've only had a couple web sites hang when using the 3g option. Streaming Netflix, or Youtube has been seemless for the most part. Good clean picture.-I also bought a 64gb micro sd card which should be way more than enough. I uploaded thousands of pics to it and barely put a dent. The apps do take up much of the 8gb of memory in the phone, so you'll want most everything to go to the sd card.-There is a nice tutorial website for newbies like me.-The one thing I had to get used to was the power button. As mentioned in other reviews, it is kind of inconvenient, but not a deal breaker for me by any stretch of the imagination. It just took some getting used to.-It is large, which also takes some getting used to, but the benefits to that outweigh the detriment, for me at least. I was comparing my phone with a friend who had the latest phone, rhymes with snapple,which costs more than twice what mine does, and they were the same size and thickness. He also had complaints about his battery, and it seemed mine lasted longer. That was all we compared, so I'm sure in other ways his is ahead, but again, this phone was $300 to $400 cheaper. It's bigger than most phones, and smaller than a tablet, is it a phablet? a phoblet? A phonlet?So to sum up, as an admitted first time smart phone buyer, so far I am happy...knock on wood. If you have time, read as many reviews as possible of this and other products to compare. I found this phone had as high if not higher stars than the top, much more expensive phones. It may not have the HD quality of the more expensive phones but it is still pretty good. I kind of miss my old flip phone, in other words not paying a monthly bill, but oh well. My old flip phone couldn't guide me through unfamiliar cities either. And I find I use text much more than talking.I have noticed that the phone is no longer for sale on the Virgin site.",2015年4月29日 在美国审核
Worth It at Twice the Price! NOT ANYMORE!,"** Update October 2016**The upgrade to the latest Android 5.0.2 makes this formally wonderful phone painfully useless, other than to take pictures and call people. With only 8 gig of space on the phone, and no way to get rid of HTC and VM bloat, you'll be able to install MAYBE 4 apps tops. It's gotten to the point where I can't even update the apps I have on the phone already, and this was after I ""moved"" what I could of the apps to the SD card.If there was a way to get rid of HTC and VM stuff and install apps DIRECTLY to the SD card, I would probably keep this phone for another 2-3 years. Now I am phone hunting again, and with VM's lack of current new mid-priced phones, I might end up with another carrier, which is not good considering I've been with VM for probably 10 years now.***********I've had this phone for 11 months now and it is still an incredible deal at the 199 dollars I paid and now Amazon is selling it for 50 dollars cheaper!This is the first time that I've gone a year without new phone envy. To say I'm still in love with this phone is an understatement. The pictures are incredible; in fact, I have used images straight from my phone to the front page of my work's website. Google Now is flawless and quick. A few Siri users have been jealous of how well it works. The screen is large and clear, and the response rate is fast. Speakers are fairly loud, and maintain a lack of distortion as the volume rises. Battery life is surprisingly good, especially on standby mode, where I could go days without using the phone and not a drop of life is wasted. I can understand some people's issues with the left side buttons, but as a lefty, it works great for me!The only issue, and it doesn't directly affect the phone itself, is finding a decent holster for it to hang from a belt, due to its size. I've gone through 3 of them already, but the phone is so worth getting, I just chalk it up to the cost of doing business. If you carry your phone in a purse or in your pocket, you'll have no troubles with this phone.",2015年9月3日 在美国审核
One camera worked great!!,"Bought 2, one for me one for wife, ADVISE, take some pictures as soon as you get it. One camera worked great !!!! one made every picture blueish/purple. Check camera when there is little light and flash must be used. If you get blue pictures, send it back, thank you amazon ! otherwise great phone for the price, also get a micro flash card, load any app that can be loaded to the card, to the card. Has good memory but a lot of memory is used by pre-loadednon-removable apps and OS. Store all music and photos on card, I suggest 32 GB, they are cheap. I have 9000 songs and 3000 hd pictures on card and it still has 1/2 of its memory available. Now if you get a phone with KIT KAT, you can bypass the ""lock screen"", not the security screen. If it updates to lollipop, you must have both screens, pain in a@@. When you get it you will see what I mean. Kit Kat works great, lollipop does too, but it forces some things down your throat. (if you don't want to update, change update settings BEFORE connecting to internet, once you have lollipop you can't go back-even with factory reset. Yes, stupid lock screen bothers me that much, security screen is enough, I use pattern, but it will accept pin or face recognition. Do a tour of the internet. GOOD phone....Check camera first !!!! Seems to be a defect that HTC can't fix.I spent a lot of time ""chatting"" with HTC, camera is 13 MP and when working correctly is fantastic. Remember Amazon 30 day return.",2015年10月4日 在美国审核
"Bought 3 of them; it's the family standard phone in my house. Great value, great phone","Update of a previous review.I have seen this phone priced as high as $250, which is not bad for an unsubsidized, mid-range smartphone.I bought my first one on Amazon at $179, now they are down to $149.I suspect this is a clearance, as this phone is no longer listed on the Virgin Mobile website.We have will soon have 3 family members all running the same phone.Yes; it's that good.Virgin Mobile has some of the best plans but some of the worst phones.It's slim pickins on the VM website.I think Sprint uses the VM brand to get people in the door, and then pushes them to Sprint when they want a decent phone.This phone is a nifty way to circumvent that strategy; it's one of the best that VM has ever offered.Online activation of a VM branded phone is equally easy no matter where you buy it.Amazon has better prices and selection than the VM website, so this is the right place to be shopping.This phone is almost as good as a Nexus 6, for about 1/3 of the price.The case is plastic instead of metal, so the phone will not tolerate unlimited punishment.I bought a case and glass screen protector, so it should be ok.The speakers are superior, camera is very good. The screen is quite large.Resolution is not quite up to iPhone retina standard but it's more than adequate, especially considering the large size.You can get a slightly better phone, but not in this price range.This phone uses the Google app store, which is a big plus.This phone arrives running Android 4.4 (Kit Kat), but upgrades to 5.0 (Lollipop).Kudos to HTC for not forcing this phone into obsolescence.There are better phones out there, but not in this price range.Using this phone with Virgin Mobile means you can say ""No"" to contracts and $600 phones without giving up very much.Highly recommended.",2014年12月26日 在美国审核
Piece of !@#%,"I am changing my review from the original 5 starts to two for multiple reasons. I loved this phone for the first few months, ran great. Camera is pretty good which was important to me. Now that I have had it awhile it crashes all the time. The texts are really slow, I have to wait a minute or two for them to load and it crashes all the time when I'm in the middle of typing something. It also lags as I type which is extremely frustrating. It has an energy saving thing that I can't turn off and when the battery gets low it locks your phone and closes all your apps, in the middle of doing something. I now am having problems with charging it also, i recently let the battery die all the way to get a better charge and it took me 24 hours to get the phone to turn back on, I didn't think it was going to ever turn back on honestly. This phone is good with Bluetooth and I don't have a problem with calls most of the time which is why I didn't one star. I would not recommended this phone to anyone who plans on using it for over 4 months. The screen is really big so it breaks easier so if you do but this phone, you need a glass screen protector or a really good case...",2016年1月8日 在美国审核
A Rare Goddy That's Hard to Find,"This (device) is definitely a ( rare ) one of a kind device , aka a ( Phablet ) Phone/Tablet. I was totally overwhelmed when I saw this device again on Amazon*This replaces my first one I lost when trying to catch a bus when it was snowing. What a heartbreak. After trying several other HTC devices, which was a No Go. I really like the features of this device. The size of this device alone is a some what ( larger ) than most mobile devices, Which I really like.Love the features , excellent video cam, great twin boom sound speakers, power saver mode, As far as apps &amp; storage I installed a 64gb micro card to remedy the storage apps issue that come with this phone. I only use certain apps any. What I also like about the HTC816, is the amount of accessories that's usable. 6 different bumper protectors, glass shield film sheets, stylus pens, phone holder - stands not bad for a no contract phone &amp; all of it's extras. I'd like to see HTC bring this back again, 2 functions from 1 device.",2017年3月7日 在美国审核
"A solid, budget-friendly phone!","I've been very impressed with this phone, and I've gone through my fair share of mobile devices over the years. I put all my devices through their paces, modifying and customizing almost everything. My new HTC Desire 816 has held up wonderfully--so well, actually, that I've stuck with much of the out-of-the-box functions. Here are some things that have really impressed me with this phone:- Battery life has exceeded my expectations. I came from a Galaxy S4, which began to overheat and chew through its battery, so I was pleasantly surprised when I could get about 36 hours of battery life from my new HTC. The sad reality with new devices is that, with more powerful processors being smooshed between thinner and thinner devices, battery life inevitably suffers. The 816's specs are just a notch below the One M8's, and luckily, this is a plus for battery life. At the end of the day, as apps get increasingly innovative, they suck more life from your battery. It just happens.- Screen size. It's huge. A 5.5"" screen is the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus, for reference. The immense screen is borderline unwieldy--holding the phone in one hand, it's difficult to reach the topmost corner with your thumb. It takes some getting used to, but in the end, I really appreciate the increased screen real estate. Although they never mention it, this phone falls under the ""phablet"" category.- The Boom Sound speakers are the bread and butter of the HTC line. I can't tell you how nice it is not to have to cup my hand around a rear speaker! Why didn't anyone think of this before? The overall sound quality is fantastic as well. I'm not into listening to music without headphones, but watching videos and movies is immensely more enjoyable with front-facing speakers. Bravo, HTC.I could go on, but suffice it to say that I'm very fond of this phone. Paying under $200 for a phone is a miracle notwithstanding, but when it's a solid device like the Desire 816, I'm happy.",2014年10月28日 在美国审核
"A phone that could have been great, but Android came and ruined it.","I'm actually very glad this phone isn't available to be bought anymore. This phone was great until the Android 5.0.1 update and after that everything just went to the dumps. The assortment of problems are frequent random app crashes, battery draining / not charging issues, calls &amp; texts not going through until the phone gets restarted (which is about 3 times a week now). In fact, in order to update apps, I have to update each app by itself, then move it to the SD card, then run CCleaner, Then move to the next app. There should be no reason I need to delete apps just to update the ones I have to maintain functionality.I had to have this phone replaced by Virgin Mobile because of the charging problems and no calls / texts without restart, and the one they sent me new didn't have the battery issues, but the calls and texts problem is still there. Needless to say this will be not only my last Virgin Mobile phone, but also my last HTC as well.",2016年4月5日 在美国审核
Worthy phone to consider if you like the M8 and M9 series of HTC models.,"I have had this phone 4 weeks now. I am totally in love with this model. I would almost say the phone is perfect. Except for two small details. 1). The phone does have a small glitch. After swiping my security pattern to unlock the phone. Instead of defaulting to the home screen. My phone defaults to ""Get Google Now"". So I need to click the return key twice each time to exit that app and get to the home screen. Is that really a major flaw on the phone? Too me it isn‘ t and the phone out performs my former Samsung Galaxy IIIs. 2). The battery is not replaceable on this phone. So once the battery starts to die on this phone. I can expect a high price to replace the battery. Hopefully by that time I will use my 2 year warranty I bought on the phone. Aside from those things I love this phone. I will stick with the HTC One type of phones. Mainly because they produce great sounds thru the front firing speakers. Update: 11/11/2015. I still own this cell phone and I love it. The visuals and camera are beautiful. I originally fell in love with the front firing stereo speakers. But for some reason about 6 months ago, it seems my stereo sound isnt as powerful or maybe the stereo isn't as stereo as it used to be. Regardless this phone is still a pleasure to buy. And when I bought this phone last year, the cost was $218.99. Now this phone costs only $149.99 and I am considering to buy a new replacement. This is my favorite phone only because I am too cheap to buy the M9 model. But I would love to have the M9. I have too admit I am super cheap because this year I just recieved over $115k in bonus money. And here I am crying about paying a little under $500 for the M9 from HTC. So yes I am a cheap person and I admit it, but the 816 model is a super deal! By the way I just purchased another 816 Desire to replace the one I have. I loved the power and sound of my speakers. But since mine somehow lost the power and stereo sound. Buying a new one at this lower price is a great deal in my opinion! Update:12/25/2015. Instead of ordering a $149 HTC 816 I found within the hour the same phone priced at $118! Only exception it took the company over 1 month to send it to me free no shipping charges! Once I get it I probably won't be using it until my original purchase actually fails me. Which leads me to this review of this phone after having it almost 2 years now! Overall this phone has been a pleasure and I am grateful that Virgin Mobile allowed this phone to operate within their system. I would love to see the M8 on Virgin Mobile or M9, but I won't hold my breath. I talked to a few Best Buy cell phone sales reps and they told me that most cell phones start having problems 2 years later. That isn't unusual and that I should first uninstall any apps I having problems with. Well I am having problems with the Facebook app for the last month! After trying to see a video of some of the people on my list. My phone all of a sudden locks up from 5 to about 10 minutes! This gets very annoying, so instead I just restart my phone. Once I restart and try to watch a video on Facebook its a 50/50 split if the problem will occur again. This has become so annoying I am seriously considering of using the replacement phone I ordered. I really didn't want to use it unless I really was in a desperate situation, and this really isn't a desperate situation but it does suck! Since the phone is almost 2 years it is probably the internal circuitry that is glitching. Regardless eventually I was told that Samsungs Note S5 may be coming into the Virgin Mobile system. I may get that phone since there isn't a replacement so far with Boomsound on the other phones available. Unless I get the Samsung S4 and I don't want that phone. I do know Samsun does have good sounding stereo on those phones. The strong bass sounds on this Desire 816 was the main reason I bought this phone in the first place. Let's hope Virgin Mobile can expand using better sounding phones like this Desire 816 model!",2014年11月15日 在美国审核
"So cheap, but so impressive!","I have had this phone for almost three months as of this writing, and I have to say that this phone has to be one of the best out there on the market... and I paid just $150 for it with no contract. The phone has tremendous deep value on so many different levels, and people take notice of its visual appeal.Starting with speakers (front facing), the volume can get very high if you want it to and still maintain high levels of sound quality. I use ear buds and the speakers in general to play music for myself or others, and the sound is very hard to wash out. The camera, both front and back facing, has very nice quality as well. It was a huge upgrade over what I previously owned and takes snaps, vines, and long videos with great efficiency. The editor isn't that user friendly and limiting at times, but I don't expect much out of a photo editor that comes with the phone.The screen is massive and its such a sleek, beautiful design people have often asked me what I have. Its cool that not many people know about the phone and I can show it off to them. The big screen isn't just nice to look at though, the screen is perfect to watch Netflix and you tube on and allows me to watch things with ease on it.In terms of quickly responding and downloading things fast, this phone also passes with flying colors. The phone almost never freezes up, and can smoothly run several huge apps at once and seamlessly. Its a pleasure to use, and quite the luxury.Overall, my only problem I had was a software update that didn't allow my mic to work unless I had headphones in, but I downloaded a previous firmware and fixed the problem. It was a pain for a while, but nothing major. Overall, I totally recommend this phone!",2016年2月1日 在美国审核
The first smart phone I have truly liked 100%,"Its screen isn't as fine-grained as the one on an iPhone 6+. But it's plenty good enough. I mean, these big phones have 5.5"" (diagonal) screens, and the HTC has as many pixels as my 42"" HDTV. That's more than enough for me. The HTC also has the best sound I've heard yet on a smarty phone. It has become the stereo for my recumbent trike -- along with its dashboard in general with an excellent app called the Ulysse Speedometer.I've been happy with Virgin Mobile for some years now. This phone is the best one I've ever had on their system (or on Verizon before I got smart and ditched them). The battery supposedly can't be replaced, but I suspect something can be done about that when the time comes. There are also the ""charger"" batteries you can get that hang on the back of your phone. I have a couple of them around. The iPhone shares this problem -- at three time the HTC Desire's price. Amusing.So I have a13 MP camera (5 MP selfie cam) and a generally cool device that's large enough that I no longer use my 7"" tablet, but small enough to fit in my front pants pocket. To make my phone more able to stand up to life's slings and arrows (and droppages) I got a Nillkin Frosted Shield Matte Hard Back Case Cover - fits perfectly. Also, instead of the crummy, ultra thin screen protectors that inevitably bubble, I blew the Big Bucks (under $9; free shipping with Prime) for anOptionz Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for HTC Desire 816. Hah! Feels like Gorilla Glass. We're talking serious protection here!I agonized over this phone purchase decision for several weeks. Even with Amazon's low price (lower than Virgin's) this was a bunch of money to spend -- at least for an old guy (like me) in a Florida ""55+"" trailer park. But hah! Loudest smart phone around. Play Pandora and run the bike computer at the same time -- which this phone can totally do with no lag because its CPU and RAM are up to snuff -- and life is good.One note, applies to most Android phones: Too much pre-installed crap-apps bog the thing down and suck battery. Eventually I'll need to root it to get rid of the cruft. Not knocking HTC here; most computing devices these days come with a lot of junk software pre-installed. And Facebook is the worst one. It's the most power-wasting app on my phone. It has GOT to go!(I can still access FB through the Chrome browser, so no loss except a power drain.)FREE TIP: If you're on Virgin -- and for all I know, other cell providers also do this -- you can keep a spare phone around, and if your ""main"" phone needs repair, gets stolen or is otherwise out of action you can activate the spare one in a couple of minutes through Virgin's website. So my previous phone, a perfectly good (but slightly small for me) Samsung Galaxy Victory is now in a cubby on my office wall, ready to hit the field and substitute at loose end, 1/3 back or any other position I designate.

"Yeah, alright.","This is the best phone I've owned yet, but may not be saying much considering who I am. I'm not a 'techie' but I enjoy having cool stuff. I guess this phone fits the bill. It's big with a nice bright screen and outstanding sound quality compared to what I'm used to. The speakers face forward so no more cupping the back in order to hear stuff. That would make you think this is a media powerhouse, right?Well, not exactly.Call quality is great. The power of the phone is great. The processor is fast and I rarely ever have to wait long for browser pages, or Youtube videos, etc. to load even on data. You can watch good quality videos for as long as the battery holds out... which isn't very long at all. The battery life is ATROCIOUS. Modest internet use on WiFi saps the battery in mere hours to say nothing about video. If you fool around on your phone a lot you're going to need a portable charger handy to 'top up' or else you're going to be out of juice before you can plug it in somewhere. The earlier review someone made about the battery life benchmarks being false is not a one-off. At best you'll get a day's worth of usage between charging. The battery does not drain much if at all on standby. Why this is even a thing is unknown. Was it a cost-saving measure to cheap out on the battery? It's a pretty stupid move by HTC in my opinion. Why the hell anyone would build a phone around playing media and give it a sucky non-removable battery is lost on me, but then again I'm not a millionaire CEO of a publicly traded company, so they at HTC clearly know something I don't.Another issue I have is the finicky WiFi connector. It gives me problems on certain public networks some of the time. Sometimes I can connect no problem. Other times it fires the 'unstable WiFi connection' crap at me even though it had no problems previously. My friends don't have many issues at all with their other models of phones so I'm led to believe that mine is tempermental and saucy when it comes to picking up and holding WiFi connections as if it's made out of hot coal.If you'll indulge me, this phone is a butterfingered fisherman who's had a few brewskis already before setting out for the lake and struggles to get the WiFi fish into his boat at times but he's plagued by a low-grade narcolepsy that saps his stamina and is only good for a few hours before he has to go home to sleep and recharge. But he's a loud, boisterous, fun guy who's bright and full of life and you generally enjoy his company except when he has drop everything to rush home and get some rack.I might have to work on my metaphors, but hopefully you know what I mean.",2016年5月22日 在美国审核
"Good hardware, really great price.","I love the speakers on this phone, they sound as good as anyone could possibly expect a mobile phone to sound. I have a 128GB micro SD card for storing music, movies and books for offline use while traveling. There are services that will sell you the unlock code for $13, but you must have the IMEI number, which can be found by going to settings&gt;About&gt;Phone identity.As a no carrier Android device, this is an exceptional value. I've ported my old landline number to Google Voice, and use Google Hangouts to make and receive phone calls over WiFi (single band 2.4 Ghz on this phone)and when I am home I forward my mobile phone calls to this phone, so, when I am home, this is my phone.The call quality is excellent, the front facing speakers are exceptional, the screen is quite nice, the camera can take very good photos but it is a bit awkward at times and doesn't take very good photos in low light. Full1080p video recording is very good quality, and the stereo microphones should have been a standard smartphone feature years ago.The phone has way too much useless HTC bloatware that can't be removed or moved to the micro SD card, short of rooting the device. With only 8 GB of internal memory, this is a real problem. The second SIM card slot has been physically blocked, which is just not cool.",2015年8月19日 在美国审核
"Good phone, headphone jack messed up after only 5 months.","I like this phone a lot, it's great for gaming, Youtube, web browsing and news feeds. Call quality is decent, haven't had any real issues with slowdown or restarts or app crashes (unless it was the app at fault). I like HTC's more conservative approach to pack in bloatware, this is a huge improvement over the sack of garbage Samsung phone I got last year and got rid of as soon as possible. Virgin Mobile's bloatware is another story, but removing the Mobile ID .apk from the phone's base directory stopped Virgin from killing off my wallpaper and shortcuts every time the phone restarted.Now the main issue I have with this phone: the headphone jack has become increasingly loose to where my headphone plug now slides out of the jack with very little pull - it frequently unplugs itself whenever I put my phone into my pocket. This is bad, because I need to listen to music while on public transit in order to preserve my sanity. And not dealing with a janky headphone jack is also beneficial to my sanity.I called HTC support and got someone who was almost impossible to understand, eventually I got to the point where I asked them what the outcome will be if I send my phone in and wait over a week for them to do anything with it. They said that if the problem was the result of anything that wasn't a factory defect (ambiguous; they could easily claim that it's the customer's fault for plugging in headphones and I couldn't disprove that, even though this headphone jack is objectively a POS because I've never had a smartphone jack go out on me like this) then it would cost me nearly $200. Yeah... For that much I could buy another brand new HTC Desire 816 and have enough leftover to order myself a pizza. Are you for real, HTC? You think anyone believes that fixing a headphone jack costs THAT much in parts &amp; labor? That's gouging a paying customer, plain and simple.I was loving this phone with zero reservations before, but now I have quite a few of them, especially since I just had to drop a lot of money on bluetooth headphones to make up for this audio jack fiasco.",2015年7月12日 在美国审核

People Will Be Jealous,"If you are looking for a great smartphone without having to sign a lousy contract (and let's be honest, that is still what you have to do with major carriers), then this is the phone for you! for less than $200 you can outright purchase this great smartphone. The picture is crisp and clear, cameras are a HUGE plus, very good HTC ""boomsound"" speakers, very durable, and has a larger (still very thin) screen than most other phones! People will legit not believe when you tell them that you bought this for a monthly phone plan! With that being said, expect two major drawbacks! The internal phone memory is only 8GB, which is expandle by using a micro-sd (mine is 32gb), but it was almost useless because android is so junky. Also, now that i have had the phone for a year, the phone is starting to run slower and slower! By that i mean it takes 15 seconds (literally) to open up a thread of texts from your messaging app. This is extremely annoying, but after a year of use with only these few issues, I am very Satisfied.

Most durable phone I've had since Nokia 3310,"I'm always going to try to have an HTC from now on.Every single HTC I've had has lasted for a very long time.The last phone I had was a Samsung galaxy, in one year I had at least 3 warranty replacements.Finally I'd had enough and decided to try the HTC since I'd had such good luck with them before, after several years of faithful service the phone is still going but getting a bit worn (some scratches, a couple 'dents', and an odd bright spot where the screen was once pressed hard against something).The bright spot really isn't too bad but it seems to be losing its sensitivity to touch input.The only reason I won't give five stars is the internal storage a bit small and, as with any smart phone these days, half filled with bloat ware that you can't delete without rooting the phone.This phone is as close to indestructible as I've found since the old Nokia's that could be thrown out of an airplane, dusted off, and then make a call.

BUY IT!!,"UPDATE 4-26-2015 This phone upgrades to 5.0.2 Lollipop but, don't pay over $180.00 for it.I couldn't justify spending over a grand for a device you could potentially lose. Your phone should not cost more than your desktop/laptop computer! While the majority is trying to get an iphone (overpriced &amp; under featured) or a galaxy note 4 I took a chance on this phone &amp; so far I do not regret it. The price can't be beat &amp; I might just buy another as a backup phone should this one decide to go belly up. I did ALOT &amp; I mean ALOT of research before pulling the trigger on this purchase. I almost foolishly blew over a grand for another phone that will be outclassed by its next model within a years time causing me to resale the phone on ebay just so I can get the newest model. The only 3 downsides that I can think of is 1.not water resistant 2.non removable battery &amp; 3.small on board storage capacity so you will most definitely want to blow another $100 for a 128 gig storage card. I can't lie... I love the majority of the flagship phones that come out each year but I refuse to drop my hard earned cash for them. If you're on a budget and you don't have small hands &amp; you're in the market for a phablet phone &amp; you're okay with using an Android OS this is the phone to buy! The future way I see it with the prices of the flashship phones nowadays its going to get to the point where your phone will become your desktop computer &amp; you just wirelessly connect to a monitor. Then &amp; only then can I see spending over a grand for a flagship phone.",2015年3月14日 在美国审核
Almost makes me want to get rid of my Apple iPhone ... Updated!,"Bought this phone for my daughter for Christmas. Wow! What a great screen. It's huge compared to my iPhone 4s. It's also blazing fast. Apps open immediately without any perceivable lag. Were I not so immersed in the whole ""Apple ecosystem,"" I would buy one for myself. For the price, I don't think you can get a better phone.Update:I purchased one of these myself to replace my iPhone 4s. At first I was in awe of the big screen. However, it didn't take long to start understanding the drawbacks of these mid-range Android phones. The biggest issue is all of the bloated apps that come pre-installed that you cannot uninstall or move to the SD card.Of the 8GB internal memory, about 7 of that is taken up with the OS and pre-installed apps that cannot be moved to the SD. I purchased a 64GB card with mine to expand the usable space, but all apps have to download to the internal memory first and then get moved to the SD. There is no default to put things on the SD so I'm constantly out of space. Also, many Apps only install to the internal memory and don't give the option to move. It's a big headache and one that I'm not willing to live with in the long run. This phone looks and works great. The screen is awesome. But constantly fighting the internal memory space issue is not worth it. Also, even though my iPhone 4s had only a 5Mp camera, pictures seem to be much more vibrant than with this 13Mp camera. Apple does a much better job with their stock photo editing software. I'll be going back to iOS with my next phone.",2015年1月5日 在美国审核
It is OK. It is all screen and features.,"Camera takes decent pictures and is slow, video is good, touch screen works well and looks fantastic, it can hold up to a 128gb sd card. (ONLY 8 gigs of internal, if you use a lot apps that could get tight and extremely annoying and crippling), its not a super perfect running performer but its ok. It's manufactured in Taiwan. After doing a lot of tweaking in different settings and apps I've vastly increased the battery life, although it barely makes it a day if I am using it a lot. It is versatile, as are most androids. If you are not good with smart phones or computers you may want to stick with an iPhone. It just takes some time and effort to get it all set up like you want it. Of course iPhone simply doesn't give you all the options, not to mention you spend a fortune for storage.Sometimes the screen is just blank when someone calls, sometimes the keyboard simply will not come up when attempting to enter something. These small but potentially very crucial errors are a deal breaker for me. Oh, and the camera lens gets scratched very easily, aside from the camera being extremely slow and hard to focus properly. The battery life is DREADFUL. It is buggy and gets slower over time.It feels solid like an iPhone, its a ""sealed"" phone like iPhone but it can be opened and the battery CAN be changed.Virgin has some cheap plans too, sprint network.I won't be buying another HTC due to the few crucial errors I have encountered.",2015年2月11日 在美国审核

Possibly the worse phone I've used.,"Works great for the first couple-few months but then it starts this system lag that just annoys me. I end up waiting a minute or more as the keyboard lags and tries to catch up with a message I typed out. Takes forever for the camera app to open. Usually by the time it does, that moment I wanted a picture of ended. Hardly any space on the phone, I have at max. 8 apps on my phone and I have to keep deleting to switch to other apps I use. Sometimes it messes up with how it reads the battery. One time it said I had 77% and I stopped what I was doing to plug it in, not even a minute later it said I had 47%. I charged it for an hour and it told me it had 64%. I unplugged it, hoping it'll last my work day and commute back home but the second I unplugged it it read 100%. I have issues locking and turning my screen on. The audio boost is amazing and I love how songs sound on it, just wish I didn't have all these issues with my phone.

"Good phone, specially if you like rooting it and tweaking it.","I upgraded from a ZTE Awe and essentially this is better in every way, You can't simply do a phone swap through the Virgin Mobile website if you have an existing account, i tried that and it required me to repay my monthly charge, even though i paid my monthly charge 3 days before receiving this phone on the mail, i didn't repay the charge and called customer service instead and they walked me through the process. I have proceeded to root the phone, which was easier than the ZTE Awe, and tried a few cyanogenmod nightly builds, but i lost 3g service so i reverted back to the original rom. Something that bothers me is that the second sim slot is blocked off with a rubber filling that i cant remove, i am hoping to sim unlock this device the following month for a lengthy trip to the Dominican Republic and use a CDMA network there, knowing VM's policy i will try to use a third party.As for the rest of the phone, its all good enough for me, the battery lasts long if you disable NFC, and run it in power saver mode, however i have gone further and added modifications by installing Xposed Framework running greenify and other modules that expand battery beyond that.

Great phone for a great price,"Arrived as expected. Brand new in the box. No issues. It's a pretty decent phone. I thought I'd miss having a white phone but I really like the color of this one. I'm really happy with my purchase. It runs great.. But like most HTCs it does take a little bit longer to start up. My suggestion for buyers would be to disable/uninstall unneeded apps and to purchase a SD card to ensure that it runs swiftly &amp; smoothly while you have it. I really enjoy the launcher and being able to create my own themes for it. It's great for taking videos and pictures. I do not like the pre-installed picture editor on the phone, however. It doesn't have that great of options and the ""selfie enhancing"" features on the editor just make you look like a fish-eyed doll (NOT IN A GOOD WAY). It's not that big of a deal, though. The speakers are loud and clear. The battery life is awesome... When you're not in constant use. When you're using your phone without taking breaks and have the screen on full brightness, it does die more quickly... But, most phones do. When you first turn on the phone, you have to wait for apps to update so just be patient and let it do it's thing. I remember being worried at first with it taking so long to start up, but once it did and I was able to activate the phone with no issues..I was beyond ecstatic :)",2015年6月25日 在美国审核
HTC 816 is awesome.,"Had this phone for a week and I can already tell it is a great phone. I had my eye on the Samsung Galaxy S5 with Virgin Mobile but did not want to pay the high price. Talked to a friend who already had the HTC 816 and she loved it. I read all the reviews I could find from users and I decided to take advantage of Amazons great price on it. What did I have to lose. The 13 mega pixel camera is great. Lots of features with it that my old Samsung SII did not have. This phone already has Android Kit Kat which is the newest operating system with a quad core processor. This phone moves seamlessly from app to app. With a speaker bar at the top and one on the bottom (both on the front of the phone) my music sounds awesome. It may be bigger in size than my Samsung but it is a lot lighter. Great screen resolution and even on the lowest brightness level, it is still easy to see everything on the screen.With the price of this phone and the price of NO CONTRACT service with Virgin Mobile powered by Sprint ($35-$45 a month for data, talk and text) you could not go wrong with this phone. I consider it an early Christmas gift to myself.",2014年11月17日 在美国审核
Unboxing and visuals of the phone,"Who would have thought it was cheaper on Amazon. Amazon basically stands for amazing. Im so excited. It came fast from the seller in the virgin mobile packaging. Let me start off by saying this phone is huge! It super slim,sleek and at a price you can't beat. I got the phone, a tempered glass screen protector and a case for 195$.Compared to an iphone, that's about $400 less if you were buying the phone. Its on the charger now because it just came in today but hopefully I can come back and update later on it's usage. For just being able to evaluate it visually and the packaging, it came as described, looks awesome and definitely an upgrade from my HTC evo 3d. Stayed with HTC but upgraded phones. They seem to make a good product for the value. I don't think you will beat this price until the phone gets way older technology wise but it was launched not too long ago I believe. That is all for now and I will try to update on usage later!2/15/2015 UPDATEBeen using the phone for a few days. It's been great an easy to set up on virgin mobile. Battery life is pretty good. Keep a charger if heavy user of web surfing or apps but overall good. I installed a launcher because it gives a cleaner look but I just wanted to come back and let everyone know activation was easy.

"Poor quality control, pray you don't get a dud.","Purchased this device in early January 2015. Had intermittent wifi issues but the phone was great otherwise until 31 days after purchase it stopped connecting to cell towers. Sent the phone in for repair via HTC's warranty and they tried to swindle me out of $130 to replace the LCD screen. I called and complained asking what the heck the LCD screen had to do with data connection (by the way the LCD screen was immaculate but there was a crack on the plastic housing, see more below). So after dealing with their inept online chat and level 1 phone reps, I get a call from an American who assures me they'll fix the problem.On February 12 I receive a refurbed phone from HTC. This one does connect to the cell towers but takes purple pictures. So I called to see what they could do about the purple pictures. I was told that this issued needed to be escalated and I'd get a call in 24 hours. About 5 days later I get a call while at work from HTC. Can't talk at work, they'll call back on Monday. Monday passes and 7 days later I get another call. Actually, they may have called sooner but the refurbed phone doesn't receive all calls. It seems as though every other call actually causes the phone to ring.So I'm done.Every phone I had previously purchased was an HTC but they won't get another penny from me.

Best phone I've ever owned!,"I love this phone, but I've worn it to death. The headphone jack is broken (normal wear and tear, I listen to spotify non stop) and to repair it would cost $75, so I'm just gonna buy another one. I don't even want to think about ""upgrading"" or looking at a different phone because this one is perfect. The size is huge, which is great for reading on the little screen. The phone is super heavy duty, and I've dropped it down stairs, in toilets, accidentally thrown in across rooms, and it's still kicking (minus the headphone jack. Oops!) The sound quality of the speakers is probably my favorite feature of the phone. My only complaint is that there are ALOT of apps that you can't get rid of without rooting the phone, and that leaves very little space for my stuff. Even though I have a 32gb micro sd card, I am still constantly deleting and redownloading apps. I've found that clearing off updates and disabling apps really helps, but still not as much as I would prefer. Overall however, this is my favorite phone.

Crap in a pretty package,"Well, it lasted a year, I guess that earns it one star. The other is for the nice, big screen, the decent camera and the overall sleek appearanceappearance.The rest of the phone leaves much to be desired. The bloatware/memory issue is most annoying, as others have mentioned. As time goes on, it's more and more difficult to update your apps because the pre-installed apps take up so much room.In the last three months or so, it has started to just not show calls and texts, and will show them only after I've restarted, which I have to do just randomly every so often, when it seems that nobody has contacted me in a while, because there is no other indication that anything is wrong! Highly irritating.The worst thing about it is the wifi issues it has though. It will connect to my wifi at home just fine but then will absolutely refuse to make any use of it! Slow as molasses, often just giving up halfway through a page. The mobile data is much faster (and more expensive).

As a guy whose 6'5"", this phone is perfect for my big fingers and hands.-It's fast and responsive.-Great battery life.Cons:-Only 8 GB of internal memory. That means that only a fraction of that is dedicated to apps. Apps can't be stored on the SD card. I had a hard time. I could only choose between 3 - 4 large apps. (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Slack, Spotify, etc...) This was by far the biggest detriment.- I needed to develop something for Google Cardboard for school, and after hours of trying to get it to work, I discovered that this phone is one of the only newish phones that isn't compatible with Google Cardboard.

but really like it. When I first unboxed,"Have had this phone for only 2 weeks or so, but really like it. When I first unboxed, thought maybe I made a mistake buying such a big phone but am used to the size now and love it. My phone it's replacing (HTC EVO 3D with 4.3"" screen), and my wive's iPhone, seem so small now. Still small enough to fit in front pants pocket (men's anyway). One thing I was worried about was the battery life. My old HTC phone couldn't make it through the day without recharging it at work, and that was with minimal use. Made me really think about making this purchase.The battery on this phone so far has been very impressive. I'm not one of those people who has their phone in their hand all the time, making less than a dozen calls and texts combined a day, but I do use it for web browsing more than anything and the battery lasts about a day and a half/two days. Very pleased wih this phone. Also, as far as I'm concerned (for me anyway), you can't beat the $35 Virgin Mobile pay as you go plan. 300 minutes talk per month (now with rollover minutes), unlimited text and data. Have no complaints with coverage.Also, if you're interested in purchasing this phone, found a great case for it.Very solid, two layer protection.

"Beware - Serious internal storage shortage after upgrading to Lollipop, no fix yet","Good phone, good performance with an OK camera but one massive problem - This device suffers from severe internal storage issues which can make it an absolute chore to install a reasonable amount of apps (or large apps in general). After updating to the newest Lollipop Android OS, the already small 8GB internal storage gets cut in half with over 4GB dedicated to ""Other,"" and a whopping 2GB left for apps and internal storage.Moving apps to the SD card is a must, but since certain apps simply can't be moved and the HTC bloatware takes up a considerably large chunk of storage (even when uninstalling updates or rolling them back) there aren't many options to deal with the situation. It's incredibly disappointing, as the phone has great performance and good battery life but when you have barely a single panel of apps installed and you're already getting ""Insufficient storage"" messages, something is clearly wrong and until HTC fixes it you're better off going with offerings from Samsung, LG, Google, etc. for Android needs.",2015年8月11日 在美国审核
This phone is a great phone for the price.,"OK Really 4 and a half stars. Taking half off for notification volume. This phone is a great phone for the price. Smooth, and peppy. Screen res not as high as my last phone (Samsung s3 ) but still great. The front facing speakers and the boom sound software - Excellent! I mean WOW!!! Sounds great. That being said the notification sounds could benefit from the sound software but unfortunately it does not, making the notification sound a little lower than i would like. Hence the half star deduction.I would recommend this phone for those an a budget or just not willing to put out 300 or more on a really good phone.OK UPDATE: To make notification sounds louder it is best to use mp3 files that way the boom sound will activate and make it much louder and easier to hear.Also i saw complaints about poor battery life. For me not the case. My S3 would need to be charged by 2pm everyday. My day starts at 4 am with fully charged phone. This phone at 4pm still has about 65% battery life left.

It's an okay low budget phone if you want an large screen for the price.,"It's a low budget phone I was satisfied to have purchased. I had thought 8GB of on-board storage was plenty.

Also as with all HTC phones, the back camera just isn't as good as the competition from other Android manufacturers like Samsung.Big phones are here to stay as smart phones are the most personal and used computer we own.

Honest not biased review,I fell l in love...... This phone is more than amazing for the price...... Nice big screen but not a bulky feeling to the phone..... Camera is awsome... The automatic video/picture editor Zoe is also fun and a kool feature..... The boom sound really improves audio quality on head phones speakers anything...... And the stereo speakers on the front of the phone have been the best most clear sounding speakers I have heard on a phone.... Battery is what scared me a bit but it does last and the phone has options to extend battery life in emergency.... The only flaw was memory.... Bloat wear takes up almost half of the 8g and most apps on the app store aren't transferable to the SD..... There are ways to tweak your phone...( Look it up) .... To be able to transfer any app to SD so that no longer is a problem..... I had the Galaxy s3 for a long while.... Nd this is a big upgrade in my opinion.....

Whats the point on having a good performance phone with a big screen if you cant ...,Memory Is more important than performance! It claims to have 8gb but it only lets you actually use less than 3gb probably around 2gb. First app i wanted to get was my already purchased GTA SanAndreas app for android. About 2.3gb and the phone couldnt even install that from the lack of memory. Whats the point on having a good performance phone with a big screen if you cant even try it out from the lack of internal storage. Iv had way cheaper Virgin Mobile phones that had way more capacity and were filled with a bunch of apps without the problem im having now. So this is a major issue. I cant even download my fl studio mobile app because if i did it would be the main app and i wont be able to download much else and thats not fun. Other than that i love the big screen. Good speakers for a phone. Love the cameras.But thats all i can say,2015年10月30日 在美国审核

Good Big Phone at an Excellent Price,"This phone is about the size of a Galaxy Note 3.It took a little getting use to the size, but my old eyes love having all that screen.I've now had it over 8 months without issue.The phone is a solid build and fits comfortably in my (big) hand.I wouldn't say Apps initiate immediately (1.6 ghz quad-core processor), but I haven't had any noticeable lags during initiation.It takes good photos for social media (13 mp rear, 5 mp facing); video quality is good with adequate lighting, not so good in dark surroundings (does have light/flash on phone), and audio recording is good. The display is crisp to view and very east to read (5.5"" HD), protected by Gorilla glass.There is significant glare on the screen in bright sunlight, making it almost impossible to see. Overall, for the price (now at $149), you cannot beat it.It isn't an IPhone 6 Plus, but it isn't suppose to be.I would definitely repurchase this phone (like, 4 of them) before I would buy an IPhone 6 Plus",2015年8月6日 在美国审核
Packs a punch!,"Writing this review from my new phone! I have been a long time Virgin Mobile customer.. I have had about six virgin mobile phones all together. I love that I can pick and pay as I please instead of having to pay an arm and a leg in order to have a smart phone.This phone is just...wonderful. It is crazy fast, the screen is huge (I'm a small female and it fits my hands) the speakers are so loud! I upgraded to this phone after having the iPhone 4 for a couple years and I don't miss it even a little. I would have to cup the bottom of my iPhone when I was showing someone a video or put it in a bowl while listening to it at home...not anymore! The camera is also much better. It takes very crisp and bright photos (selfies are very crisp too lol). The thing I love most is that you can customize this phone to make it your own. There are many themes and color schemes to choose from and also many options to customize your phone experience. With the iPhone I felt a lack of customization big time! Overall this phone packs a punch! If you're looking for a reliable, customizable, high end feeling phone..this phone is for you. I would reccomend to a friend indefinitely.",2015年2月23日 在美国审核
Great android phone for a decent price!,"So far this phone has been working perfectly. I heard a lot of negative comments about the battery life. It's true the battery life isn't long. It seems I would have to charge it daily if I wanted to really use all there is to offer; however, I realized a great deal of battery life was used to maintain this livefeed page or widget that takes up a full screen on the phone. It's constantly updating news and other media. I knew I could really live without it. I deleted the livefeed page (I forgot what it was called) and my battery life is extended to up to 3 days now with light use.Another note: the screen is huge, not Galaxy huge but pretty big! It's perfect for those who have trouble texting due to large thumbs (like me!), reading ebooks, and watching movies on the go.It's a great moderately priced android phone, does everything other phones can do. I did have to upgrade my virginmobile grandfathered plan of $40 to $45 monthly but big deal, I'm sold!",2015年4月19日 在美国审核
"Good phone, not enough memory!","So after a couple of months of use here are my impressions: fantastic screen size! You think you don't need a bigger screen but once you use it you'll love it. As a woman I find that it's not as cumbersome as I thought it would be. It's slim so it will slip into your purse easily. The camera is good. Not iPhone good, but good. The biggest problem I have is the limited on board memory. 8gb sounds like a lot but it's really, really not. 😯Especially because a lot of the pre-installed and can't be moved to the SD card or can't be uninstalled abd these take up almost 5gb!!! It's maddening. I have a 32gb SD card and only have a handful of apps installed (grocery list, podcast, Facebook, FB messenger, Words with Friends, Solitaire...) nothing huge but I'm constantly having to uninstall something to install something else.

The S3 is a good phone but I find that all the little bugs ...,"After my screen cracked on my Galaxy S3, I replaced it with this one. The S3 is a good phone but I find that all the little bugs that the Samsung one had, are gone here. Apps don't crash as frequent. Maybe it's because I learned not to have so many open at a time. My WiFi connections are stable, bugs in most apps are gone. Camera is great quality and the screen is nice and big. I thought that a phone this size would have trouble fitting into my front pocket, but no, not an issue at all. speakers are nice sounding.The only things I can think that irked me are the gallery app. The phone will automatically place random photos into a highlight reel that plays all throughout the gallery. Even when you erase the highlights, the phone will pop new ones back in. Kind of annoying but I disabled the ZOE app and it hasn't came back. Also, since the phone doesn't have physical home and back buttons, the location of these buttons change as the screen rotates. Providing you have auto rotate feature on. Oh, the default music player doesn't have an equalizer which is a bummer, but the dual speakers sound great.So yea, I'm happy with the phone.",2015年5月12日 在美国审核
Awsome mid level phone? This thing is beast!,"Very nice phone. Upgraded from old virgin mobile HTC evo v 4g. It's a HUGE difference in every aspect. Very quick and responsive. After a couple days I noticed slightly tapping torwards top of phone it will make a little vibrating sound like something is broken inside, hoping it's just defective, already ordered a replacement. Nice big screen and good sounding speakers. Not very good selection on cases but found a otterbox look alike on Amazon for $8.50. My only real down side is the battery is non removable and will someday need replacment or disposal. That being said for a 2600 mah battery it's not bad at all. And I was used to my 3000 mah battery from sedio for evo v 4g. For the price I paid $177 it is well worth it considering a galaxy s5 is like $500 and this thing is as big as the iPhone 6 +. Comfortable with my last HTC this one is no different!Edit - received new phone still has a slight vibrating sound torwards top of camera when tapped on. Does not affect phone performance. And I guess android 5.2 lollipop is only going to be for the dual SIM version. The virgin mobile version which I have will stay at kit Kat 4.4 still a great phone.

Among the Best for the Price and Quality.,"For the price and functionality of this phone, IT IS A 5 stars!This phone is great that I had to buy a second one for a relative.STRENGTH:Great alternative to expensive phone such as Galaxy S5 or Note 4.Only cost about 1/3 of them. Screen just mm shy of Note 4, but overall physical shape is mm larger than the Note 4. Naked eye can't tell much different on screen resolution between high-end and this phone, why spend more? HTC signature of two speakers (stereo) not mono. Fast response. HTC ZOE--The best Music player I ever had, music screensavers, lyrics if the songs are available - download album artwork etc.WEAKNESS: Android- a customizable OS, but has great limitation than Windows. Kit Kat OS now can't copy filesto SD (Google's idea?) unless use PC w/micro adapter intransfer files, via usb cable often crash. 4GB remaining internal storage.

"It has a great display, but it feels like a toy","This phone is way too big. It has a great display, but it feels like a toy. I dropped it and it shattered (I should have had a case on it, but it wouldn't charge with the case I had on). The sound is pretty good, and the battery lasts a long time. But one thing I hate is that there is no privacy when you're using this phone. Everyone around you could look and see what you're doing. Some phones have the fade when you look at it from another angle, but not this one. I wouldn't but this phone again. I've had it for about 6 months, and I just can't handle how crappy it is. It took forever to get the newest android update, and now my phone is incredibly slow. I've just ordered the Galaxy s5, which is more expensive, but worth the cost.

The resolution isn't really noticeable at all to 98% of consumers. The screen provides vivid colors, and text looks great. The only way to really notice the resolution is by comparing it to another device displaying the exact same content, but even then there would be minor differences to screen quality.

"Great Phone, Great Price","I've been a Virgin Mobile customer since 2007 and upgraded from my HTC EVO 3D. I've had the HTC 816 for about two months of medium to heavy use. This is a large, mid-priced phone that looks and acts like a flagship model. I love it.The display is fantastic, the battery life is more than adequate (especially when you disable the Blinkfeed, etc) and it's REALLY easy to set up and transfer all your stuff. It may not be the fastest processor on the market, but at this price point it's pretty impressive. I augmented the storage with an inexpensive 32 GB card and moved over everything I could.Five Big Stars.

Htc desire 816,I wanted to find a phone with a great camera on it but wasn't too expensive. This said it has a 13 mp camera so that was the sole reason I bought it. It does take some good outdoor photos but I'm not impressed at all with how it takes the pictures while I'm inside. I must have missed the part where it said the size of the phone because I was shocked with how big it was. It is something I'm still trying to get use to. The one thing I absolutely hate about this phone is the storage space. I have a 16gb sd card in the phone and transfered everything possible to the card but yet I have no room at all on the phone. I can't even update half my apps because there's no room to do so... Even the apps that are on the sd card.

"It's too big, but good nonetheless.","The HTC Desire is my first foray into the ""phablet"" zone of smartphone.A friend of mine has an iPhone 6 Plus and this thing is exactly the same size, just a hair thinner.We did some side-by-side tasks such as opening and operating apps, playing video, and re-booting the phone and each one performed those tasks at identical speeds.The major difference - the HTC used only 2% of its battery versus the iPhone using 5%.This is a fantastic phone.My only complaints:The phone is ENORMOUS!If you're not used to a 5+ inch phone, it will take some time to get used to.Say goodbye to one-handed operations.The other complaint - HTC loaded up the phone with TONS of bloatware that I will never use, and it's incredibly difficult to get rid of.The only tool that was worthwhile to me was the Phone transfer tool that used peer-to-peer WiFi to download all of the data on my old phone that Google had not backed up to the cloud (non-Google contacts, app settings, passwords, etc.).It made initial setup a breeze and within 10 minutes of activating the phone, it had everything my old phone had - exactly where it was supposed to be.",2015年2月2日 在美国审核
"Developer Friendly, XDA support","This is a great phone, especially for developers. HTC will help you root the phone, this has XDA support, Custom recovery with CWM and Cyanogen Mod has a stable rom for this running KItKat 4.4.4.I have two of these in my house. One is mine, the other is my wife's.Pros:Fast, reliable, unbelievably good sound, sufficient internal storage plus SD. Camera is great, battery is awesome. My wife had hers running for two days in normal mode without having to charge it.Cons:Case Selection - I have three cases for this phone. Luckily my wife liked one of them so she uses it, the other is a StihlGut leather case that is cumbersome, and the one I use now is the Amzer puddin case. It is slim, grippy and gives pretty good protection. Of course, get a glass cover for the screen as well.Stock ROM for HTC has so many icons on the top bar that you care nothing about.

I bought a 126GB sim card and have all pictures and videos auto-saving there, yet I only have 2GB actually saved there.

You need this phone!,I had the HTC One V for a while and traded it in because I wanted a larger phone. But I loved that HTC phone and was always looking for one to go back to. After using the Virgin Mobile Supreme/ZTE Supreme for a long while I found myself without a tablet (my tablet all of a sudden stopped working). I decided to consolidate technology by getting a larger phone to take over tablet duties and happened to see the HTC Desire 816. I wanted to get it for a specific price and Amazon had it so here we are.I have to say that this phone is the best phone I have had so far. So far I haven't felt need to replace my tablet. The screen size is really good (5.5 inches is substantial without being too crazy...even though if it were a little bigger I wouldn't complain) and it helps that it is a really light weight phone. Editing documents is a snap (running Office Mobile). I use it to take notes in church as well as in meetings at work and it works great.The camera takes amazing pictures and video which I can upload in a snap with the 4G LTE. The sound system is off the charts and the speed is great. I have added a 32GB micro SD but you can add up to 128GB.I was surprised how light it was when I received it...you definitely need a case so that it will not get broken. Make sure you buy a silicone one with a hard case attachment.I have dropped it a few times and have not had any problems.The only change I would ask for is it HTC would make the screen a little bigger (maybe 5.8 - just because I use it for so much more than just a phone). I also would add more internal memory. 8GB is good (I'm not a gamer so it doesn't bother me but it might bother others) but 16GB would be much better.I have had this phone since November/December and I can rightly say I am well pleased! This one hit all the right buttons with me.,2015年2月15日 在美国审核

Go turn on power saving mode and it makes a world of difference and I don't see that it is acting any differently than before... no compromise that I can see.The inactive battery saver at night is AWESOME if you forget to plug it in.It's the first phone that plays nice with my car's bluetooth system and streams my music from Google Play..

What's not to like?,"Bought this to replace an HTC Evo 3D that was malfunctioning. Screen-size on this phone is pretty big (and beautiful) and the battery goes for over a day with normal use which is a huge improvement over the Evo. I actually fixed the Evo recently and contacted Virgin Mobile who said I could still use it as needed as often as desired without incurring any swapping fees. So I can take the Evo skiing where a smaller phone would be more practical and use the 816 for workdays, etc. - great to be able to switch as desired. I bought the little leather case and a glass screen protector and they seem to function just fine. It's only been a week of ownership but there are no cons that come to mind other than the size is too large for some activities.

"Great phone, Great price. Made a wonderful upgrade.","I wanted to wait a while to fully try out the phone before reviewing, so here it goes. This has to be one of the best phones I have ever had. I was wondering about the size at first, upgrading to a much bigger screen from what I had, but now I love it. I don't have problems with the power button like other reviewers have mentioned, I usually use both hands to hold my phone anyway. The battery life for me has been great, but then I always plug it in at night anyway, but even at work, in a concrete and steel building for 12 hours a day, I have at least 50% left to go home with. The phone also has two different power saver modes if you really need to conserve power. The ""Boom Sound"" front speakers are great too, no need for a extra speaker, and the boom sound improves the quality of the sound with headphones in too. One thing I did have to do is buy a case for it, the plastic shell felt a little uncomfortable in my hand (like it would slip out) and cases are hard to find for this phone, not a great selection. All in all, this is a great phone for a great price.",2015年3月22日 在美国审核
I like it,"I waited until I had this almost a week before writing my review. I do like the size and clarity of the screen.

I wish this phone had some of that phones features. You can't personalize it as much. I am very happy with the battery life. I can charge it at night and with the battery saver on all the time, it's at 80% by the time I get home from work. That's with some texting while at work. The LG would be at 30-40% with the same use. The camera is more complicated to use. It has options like my Canon digital camera. It's going to take getting used to. Pretty good phone. I'll keep it.

Of course I got a different phone now, but I use the desire 816 daily for video chatting and it's always working like a charm.

The Hottie Smartphone that will make you cheat on your tablet girlfriend!!!,"Best Phone I've ever owned!!! It is extremely awesome if you happen to be a photographer or videographer it has the capable tools to suit your needs. The zoom lens as with MANY regular camera tends to become abit pixelated when taking an up close tight shot but this is forgivable. My only beef is it doesn't have a quick-press camera button. Instead, you are forced to press by screen to initiate the camera app function. It does have the option to turn the volume button into a quick shot camera button, but I chose to use this for the camera zoom which to me is VERY important. Other than the aforementioned, I can't really say anything bad about this device. I'm constantly buying extra parts to help assist in my smartphone filmmaking. This thing is super AWESOME!!

Amazing phone and supprising good service from VM.,"So far after my first few days this phone is awesome. It reminds me a lot of my old note 2. It is the same size and pretty much the same functionality. I had turned off most of the gimicky things off the note anyways as all they really did was drain the battery. The screen is very nice, very responsive to swipes. Opens apps and plays games like fruit ninja with out a problem. As some have also said the only thing that I may say is bad is the battery life. It doesn't have the longest life span before getting drained. For all the other good things so far from this phone for how much I paid for it, it is a very minor complaint. Also another thing that I noticed on this phone that I haven't seen on other phones is that when one makes a call, it seems to boost the signal. I will have one bar and then make a call and it jumps to 4 or 5 bars then back down when the call is done.",2015年1月25日 在美国审核
The Samsung Galaxy J3 is much better than this phone,"As of 2017, do NOT buy this phone.The Samsung Galaxy J3 is much better than this phone.With 8gb of storage, minus the space it already takes up for the OS and all the unnecessary bloatware, You are only left with less than 2gb available.Internet downloads cannot go straight to the SD Card.You must download it onto the phone and then transfer it.And, the biggest killer for this phone was the Battery.I owned this phone for about a year and a half.After less than a year, the battery could barely last more than 4 hours under heavy use and would take up to TEN HOURS to charge fully, even with the good charger that I had.The Samsung Galaxy J3 has exceeeded this phone's limits.Its just an all round better phone than the HTC Desire 816.",2017年8月23日 在美国审核
Love this phone!,I switched from a AT&amp;T Note 3 to the HTC Desire816 and so far I am really happy with this phone.The size is similar (smidge bigger) than the note 3. I have always been a fan of HTC phones. It is quick and smooth haven't had any problems with the phone lagging. The camera quality is great in my opinion. Having a good camera is really important to me and I haven't had any bad quality photos. The only thing I did was download a keyboard from the play store because I felt like I wasn't able to type very fast and accurate on the phone. The new keyboard solved that problem. The call quality is some thing I am still getting used to. Overall I am very impressed with this phone and you can beat it at only $55 a month on Virgin Mobile.,2014年10月24日 在美国审核
So nice I bought it thrice,"When I was looking for a replacement for my iPhone, I knew I wanted to go Android.I also knew that I would be going with Virgin Mobile to save a ton of money each month.So my phone choices were limited to the Android phones offeredby Virgin.I had in mind a price target of around $200, so that further limited my choices.I saw this phone and read as many reviews as I could find by professionals and ""regular folks"".I decided to give this a try, and am glad that I did.There are only a few things that I don't particularly care about with this phone, but those boil down to differences between IOS and Android.(I vastly prefer Android, but Apple did get a few things right.)But for the most part, I couldn't be happier.Great functionality, great performance, great display.I haven't had any glitches, crashes, or unexpected reboots.This thing behaves quite well.My primary recommendation for potential buyers is to start out with a decent-sized SD card, and then set all of your applications to record there.The available on-board memory is largely consumed out of the box, leaving only about three GB or so available.I bought a 32-GB card and don't worry about running out of memory, as I did with my iPhone, which locked me in to 16 GB with no way of expanding.Another recommendation is to buy a good case and a screen protector.The phone itself doesn't seem very sturdy with its plastic case, and the front and back are both fingerprint magnets.Get a good case to protect it from jolts, drops, and scratches, and you'll have something that should last a long time.Two of my sons saw my new phone and decided that's what they wanted for Christmas.So I ended up buying a total of three.All three of us are quite pleased with our phones and would recommend the 816 to anybody who asks.We don't have any complaints at all.",2014年12月27日 在美国审核

I very much like the features on this phone,"I very much like the features on this phone. However, It has a few glitches that have been giving me some trouble.First, it sometimes does not register that I have hung up on a call. Even though I am no longer connected to the person I was talking to, the phone registers me as in a call, and the hang-up button doesn't work, and I can not place any new calls. I have to restart the phone to fix this.Second, there have been instances where my keyboard will not pop up when I wish to type in a type field in messaging, chrome, etc. This either corrects itself after an indeterminable amount of time or I restart my phone.Most recently, I have been getting dead spots on my screen where the phone doesn't register that I have pressed that area. First, it was the top left corner of the screen that was dead (unfortunate, since that is the back button). It now works, and has recently been the left-middle of my keyboard OR the middle right, so that either the letter ""a"" or ""L"" will not function. Sometimes restarting my phone fixes this issue.While I do believe this phone has some nice features and is rather smooth, it has some very odd glitches in the hardware that don't make sense and interrupt my daily usage of the phone. Perhaps I received a funky one, but regardless, a phone shouldn't have these issues.",2016年1月11日 在美国审核

Useless Storage,"I've had Virgin Mobile for 8+ years now and this phone has been one of the most useless ones I've had in terms of memory/storage. Even with a 64 gb memory card and telling the phone to automatically save things to it vs the phone, not everything (apps) can be moved/saved to it, so a lot of it has to stay stored on the phone's memory. I can't download any extra apps or even update what's there already because it tells me I don't have enough storage. It's to the point recently that I can't even open apps because it's been so long since I've downloaded updates, so here I am on the search for a new phone.

It's the slowest I've ever used. I have a toddler and can NEVER catch him in a picture because it's seriously almost always a full second between my pressing the button and it taking the actual photo.

The phone doesn't like to move apps to my 32gb sd card. If you want to use the space you have for games and larger apps, be prepared to compromise.The light that indicates new messages and such is very easy to miss.The Camera is lack-luster for a 13mp beast.

The audio is also just as good. Touchscreen buttons haven't been an issue at all, easy to text and type.One complaint I have is that it had too much pre-installed apps, especially Zoe, which takes up a lot. I also preferred TuneIn radio(on my old HTC One V) instead of this new NextRadio(HTC Desire 816).

it's surprisingly easy to handle,"This was an upgrade from an old Samsung Galaxy S2, so others upgrading from something more modern may not be as impressed. With that said, wow! First, let me commend the seller - I received this phone a full four days before the scheduled arrival. I had the misfortune of purchasing on a Thursday, and due to processing, shipping and the weekend, I wasn't supposed to receive it until the following Wednesday. It came Saturday. I was ecstatic. Huge kudos to the shipping and processing teams.Upon unboxing, the first thing you notice is the size of this thing - it's big. The screen by itself is as large as my old S2, and that's not including the extra space for speakers and logo. However, even with its large size, it's surprisingly easy to handle. I have very average-sized hands and can even use the keyboard with one hand, albeit with practice. After a month of using the phone, however, I couldn't imagine owning anything smaller. It's probably heavier than many phones, but still weighs less than my wife's iPhone 5c, and is much larger.The appearance is great, with a nice, big screen, matte finish and good feel. Some people may dislike the plastic back and the fingerprints that will get all over it, but that's a very minor concern - you're not using the back of your phone. A four dollar case alleviates any complaints with that entirely.The interface is great. I'm very much a minimalist, and the icons for many of the default programs are nice and simple and fit the resolution perfectly. I'm still adjusting to some of the intricacies of the HTC interface as opposed to the Samsung one, but the Android base still makes everything very familiar, so it really eases the process.The camera is excellent for what I've used so far. It takes large, quality images in light or dark, and you can quickly take follow-up shots without the flash (I haven't tried with the flash enabled) if you want to spam pictures to be able to get the best available. I will say that low-light images can come out grainy, but that's not abnormal, especially for a phone camera. The only thing I was forced to adjust to with the camera was the rear-camera placement. It's very easy to find your fingers blocking the camera. Again, easy to adjust to, just different.The sound is less impressive than I would've expected from two front-facing speakers, but still quite good. The downside is that I can't cup the speakers to kind of control the direction, but that's such a pedantic issue that I may as well not even bring it up.As for what most people are interested in - the battery life - I'm blown away. I don't understand how anyone could be disappointed with the battery life on this thing, unless they're coming from something tiny and are constantly using multiple features like GPS, WiFi and the like. Putting the phone on power saver mode, not even extreme power saver, and this phone will easily last WEEKS on standby. For example - I've been using my phone pretty heavily today for the last four hours - YouTube, Pandora, heavy browsing, constantly reconnecting to a weak hospital WiFi - and I'm still at 80%. I don't expect to need to charge my phone until I recharge myself. I don't understand how people can expect a very large phone to last for days to begin with, but to each his own. The only downside to the battery is that it does take a little longer to recharge. As I typically charge my phone while I'm asleep, this doesn't impact me whatsoever.Overall, this phone is absolutely 5 star material, especially for the price. It's also probably the best option available from VM if you're not wanting to shell out $500 for a Galaxy S5.",2015年6月10日 在美国审核

The sound quality is so good, that I now prefer to hear must from the speakers on this small phone than the dual-speaker/single sub-woofer stereo system attached to my computer, or from my best headphones.

and overall we both enjoy them. It is faster,"I bought this phone for myself and my fiancé, and overall we both enjoy them.It is faster, and easier to use than my previous smart phone.The picture is great, and the camera is pretty good, though perhaps not the best around.Also, it was my fiancé's first smart phone, and while he was resistant to the idea of having a smart phone at first, he quickly figured out how to use it and now enjoys having it, though he still thinks it is too big.I do agree that it is pretty large, and I have a hard time fitting it in my smaller purse, especially when it is in a case, and it sticks out of my pants pockets too far to be secure at all.But I love the size of the screen since I use photo apps like flickr and instagram.There are two negative aspects: first, there isn't a lot of room for new apps. I don't have a lot on my phone in the first place, outside of what was included, and even with disabling some included apps I don't use, I still had to get a micro SD card.The items that I store on the SD card also bounce off every time I need to restart it, so that gets annoying.Second, the battery life isn't great.Even taking measures to save power, I can't make it through an entire day without having to charge it.It seems to do well at preserving power when not in use, but with moderate use it can quickly drain.That said, though it doesn't meet the stated battery usage, it is still better than most of my previous phones (save for a very early slider phone I had which lasted for days without a charge).",2016年2月17日 在美国审核

Its nothing to do with the phone, just the forced company app. The best way i have found to avoid the situation is to let it, then don't undo the updates. you can just uninstall the unwanted apps, reset your background and home screen settings and everything else with it still installed. that way if your turn off your phone or it dies and shuts down, it doesn't just decide to reset everything back to its preferred factory settings. You can not get rid of it or do anything about it. but if you let it just once do its thing, then reset all your personal setting preferences and delete the new app icons, then it will leave you be. You have to be sure to not uninstall its updates, because it will force update no matter what and redo everything. it just needs that one time to update and its cool. it turns in to a situation of you leave it alone, it will leave you alone.",2015年2月20日 在美国审核
Some specifics I'd like to touch on in this review include the design,"Before heading off to school I decided it was time to upgrade phones to the HTC Desire 816. This phone is one of Virgin Mobile's nicer phones, and is only available on Amazon. Some specifics I'd like to touch on in this review include the design, battery life, performance, and call quality.DesignThe phone has a clean and sleek black design, with a glass front screen and matte phone cover on the reverse side. Though the matte cover on the back of the phone may show fingerprints after some use, it can easily be covered by any phone case. The front of the phone has no home, back and options buttons because they are digitalized, and only display when you tap the bottom of the screen. By having these buttons digitalized, the front of the phone looks less cluttered and more modern.Battery LifeThe battery life of the Desire 816 lasts all day with moderate use of apps, calls or texts. I've noticed that the battery on the phone declines a bit faster when using numerous apps in a short amount of time, or when on battery sucking apps such as YouTube or Tumblr. There is a power-saver feature on the phone you may turn on if you plan on using apps heavily. If you charge this phone to 100% while sleeping, the battery should easily last until you plug it in the next night.PerformanceThe performance of the phone is spectacular; I haven't had any issues or complaints yet. The Desire 816 is very fast and never slows or overheats when using a lot of apps. If you plan on backing out, opening, or switching apps, even while an app like music is running in the background, you will always get a quick response from the phone. The cover on the back of the phone isn't removable, so I've worried that if the phone would lock up I would not have a way to reset it. However, this did happen once and the phone was smart enough to notice it wasn't responding to my rapid pokes, restarted itself, and was back to normal in under a minute.Call QualityWhile this phone may look nice, run apps quickly and last all day, what should really matter is the quality of its sole purpose; calling. Let me say, there are no issues in this department either, because calls have always been easy to make, hear, and end no matter the conversation. You can easily make calls by opening the phone app and dialing a number. Adjusting call volume and options is easy and may be done while in a call, just take the phone away from your ear and it will display the settings.The HTC Desire 816 is a really nice phone and well-priced for all that it offers. You can expect a sleek, responsive phone with a battery that will last you all day. Without a doubt, this is the nicest phone out there offered by Virgin Mobile.",2015年9月25日 在美国审核
Great phone i love it ❤,"It's a great phone but has its good and bad days, the screen is just beautiful to me, definitely a hd display. The battery life isn't bad but it's not that good either, I find it actually having better battery life with power saver off then with it being on. And internal memory Is kinda disappointing because I constantly have to delete stuff to get other stuff in. But other then that it's a great phone I can honestly say I love it. The BoomSound speakers are freaking awesome, sound is loud and clear and just perfect. It's also quite fast, it has a snapdragon 410 chipset with adreno 306 graphics with that it clocks at 1.6 ghz with 1.5 GB of ram to support. And let me tell ya it helps so much. Now back to the battery, please do not expect this phone with 5.5 in 720x1280 (~267 ppi)screento have awesome battery life with a 2600 mah lithium polymer battery to have as good battery as lets say the iPhone 6+ please note that the 6+ has a 2915 mah lithium ion battery and that's with the screen at only 50% brightness on standby. Ok so just like the 6+ heavy usage isn't really this things forte. Now the camera, it's not a photo lovers dream but it's not exactly a nightmare either, with the right lighting and the proper settings you can take really good pictures. But please note that it's not solely the megapixels that make the camera good it's the sensor, so this camera has a good sensor with the pixel density to back it up. So 13mp is nice but crappy sensor crappy photos. Same goes with the front that has 5mp. Both can shoot in 1080p ok but it can be iffy. But as a whole this is a really good phone. Definitely keeping it until it dies or until I can afford a new one, and even then I'd still keep it because I really love it 😂",2015年10月24日 在美国审核
Love it!,"I was looking to buy the Virgin mobile supreme again, but they seem to have been discontinued. So I was trying to find a good phone with a nice, hd and a bigger screen. And I came across the HTC 816, and I Must say I like it better than the supreme.The phone is bigger that what I expected. sometimes it hard to hold since its so big, but I become adjusted to holding. I like the picture, its very clear and it takes really nice clear pictures. I wish the phone would come with more phone space, and they would not all of that bloatware that you cannot delete. That's probably the only thing I don't like about this phone. I also notice the went down $20 since I bought and that was about a month ago.",2015年7月13日 在美国审核
Great phone,"Love this phone, did get use to how big it is. Now I don't want to go back to a smaller phone lol.Only really downfall on this phone is two common issues with this phone.1. The SIM card - it will pop out all the time and not stay in.. I've tried so many times to keep it in there now it's kinda damaged the SIM card. So because it won't stay in I used tape to keep it closed. This is a common problem with the phone.2. Battery life- It sucks.. drains fast, esp when it comes to videos or games. Probably will want to buy a portable charger for this phone.But yes I do love this phone and suggest it 😁",2015年2月9日 在美国审核
Visually impaired ; - ),"Yes,Im legally blind ( 20/400 both eyeballs)&amp; tears ran down my face as I held in my hand the phone I purchased for my daughter on her 14th birthday. I've been suffering from an illness that took away my sight. My whole entire brain &amp; world sat on my Samsung Galaxy. It was the phone that I activated using VM after becoming quite disquested with some of the pay- each -month services if neededin my area. I was in such awe of my Samsungs screen, it seemed to hv made my life abit easier with simple things like cell phone clarity like none I've seen before whichmade scheduling easier. Also being able to see my daughters' faces up close &amp; in person w/ their photos...well up until my youngests daughters birthday I really thought I had a very nice screen for my budget. The moment she turned the phone on true clarity &amp; true beauty sat in front of our faces. I knew at that moment I was going to be buying myself this phone. Sadly enough I had been a Samsung loyal customer until my 2nd phone I had been using had the charging port broken very close to my year warranty was up exactly like the 1st phone did. I don't hv the time or money to be buying phones on a yearly basis. I hope the HTC doesn't let me or my daughter down come 1 yr from now. Only other downfall would be the storage or lack of on this amazing device. C'mon teens love photo shopping &amp;chopping &amp; they usually hv a bunch of pics.Currently my girl has less then 50 pics of herself on her phone &amp; maybe 10or so apps installed and she's already requesting a larger micro sd card.

It said it was like new and showed signs of light use which is bs cause it completely sucks!!! The charger it came with wasn't an HTC charger it sucked wouldn't stay clicked into phone so if the phone moved at all even the tiniest bit when the charger was inside it'd slip out and stop charging. You gotta hold it at just the right angle and when you let go it stops charging like usually after a while the chargers get like that but from the start it was already like broken.. Then the battery was terrible took so long for it to charge and within minutes it would drop down I'd charge my phone all night and wake up in the morning to it one hundred percent so I'd take it off and within like ten minutes it's at 75% okay those problems are annoying but what made me write this review was what happened today omg I'm so mad. So my phone dies completely and turns off cause the battery sucks so I charged it while it was off till it was 80% and go to turn it back on and this stupid white screen pops up that says ***LOCKED*** and gives me options like system reboot, factory reset, lock SIM, but from the start the phones down button never worked so I'm using the up button to scroll through the options and in the screen it said power was to select but when I'd try it wouldn't do anything except stay on that stupid lock screen I had to call virgin mobile and since I couldn't get the msnid(I think that's what it's called) the long barcode that every phone has, customer service couldn't do anything for me they were like u can get the number off the box and the seller never sent me the box so theres no way for them to even connect to my phone so they give me HTCs number and I had to call and talk to them and after about 30 minutes of being passed around and put on hold a million times they did something to where I thought it was fixed cause the tech dude got my phone to reboot and I thought it was OVER but sure enough later in the day my phone died again and I got the same lock screen bs but of course after tech support is closed so this phone sucks used!!!!

The back camera takes beautiful and clear pictures although it loses some clarity when zooming. The front camera is not as clear as the back but that is expected.I have to say that the memory is not great. It only lets you move certain apps over to a memory card so there is not much in the way of being able to increase the memory. So I have to keep my app usage to a minimum. It is enough for me but maybe not for other people.Overall I very much enjoy the phone. It gives me almost no hassle. It runs smooth.",2016年1月3日 在美国审核

It's great for watching videos on because it's about 6 inches tall and 3.5 inches wide. I call it a phablet because it's like a phone and a tablet.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it though. I will never again buy a phone where you can't remove the battery!",2015年6月28日 在美国审核

This phone is great I have to say,"This phone is great I have to say. I purchased it about 3 weeks ago and was waiting to see how it performed before I gave a review. I can't really complain about it, there are however a few things I have time point out. In the other reviews , other people commented on the battery. I do admit the battery could hold it's charge a bit better but hey that's what chargers are for. I would say I have a decent amount of applications and just recently I got alerts to update them but the phone is saying there is limited storage, however there I'd a micro chip slot in the phone so I would just be able to purchase that in the next couple out weeks. Other then those two minor issues this phone is awesome considering the price e .I had an iPhone before this and people were telling me your going to want your iPhone back. I was hesitant, but to my surprise I have yet to feel that way. I would definitely recommend it.",2014年11月25日 在美国审核
Best Bang per Buck,"Pros:A great phone overall. Fast, smooth, excellent call quality, very good speakers (though, as many have noted, not as loud as you might hope or expect from the ""boom"" name.) Good build quality, great screen. Blazing fast 4LTE. Surfing net on this is a joy, even with 20 open windows.Cons: As pretty much every review states, the whimpy, non-replaceable battery.Arrived without a SIM card. Virgin (which I love, great support, unlimited Pandora streaming even with cheapest data package) shipped one to me promptly for free. But that isn't the phone's fault. The cameras, while taking perfectly good pics, have a horrible interface. I've missed many pics while trying to get it configured to take the pic. And, again as often noted in other reviews, the power and vol buttons are poorly placed. I don't know how many times I've thought a call was dropped, only to realize I'd inadvertently turned off the volume. And it has the worst, most worthless, will figure out a way to screw up every text message and makes it take two or three times as long as it should have, typing assistant ever.Tip: Do NOT update the OS. I have over 4 gig free with several apps installed. The only annoying thing is that freaking intrusive, invasive, you only exist to give us data to mine for personal info to sell to anyone willing to pay us two cents, Google (which I loathe, despise, and do not trust a whit) spams four messages a day that pop up on screen no matter what you are doing, reminding you there is a system update available. On the bright side, it apparently really annoys them that you don't, so that's a silver lining. They also spam constantly, whining to be allowed to do ""security checks"" and turn on location services, even though I click ""don't ask again"" every time.Size. It will feel ridiculously awkward and over-sized at first. Don't worry, you'll soon get used to it. After four months, I would never go back to a smaller phone.Bottom line: Virgin is best service provider and this is best phone they have (had?). For $100, it can be forgiven its shortcomings.",2016年7月28日 在美国审核
$35 a month unlimited plan on a phone like this? Yes please.,"This phone is THE high end phone for a mid range price on Virgin Mobile. There is no comparison when it comes to the bang for your buck that you receive when buying this phone. There is not a single specification of this phone that jumps out as ""mid range phone"" level components, or memory/speed amounts (of ram, processor core speed, some may want more than 8gbs of internal memory, but throw a 64gb card in there like I did and you're good to go.) Believe me when I tell you, if you're looking for an android based device for a paltry 35 dollar a month prepaid, zero penalty plan, then look no further. This phone will handle whatever you may want through at it, and with great ease. I bought mine for $170, if you can get it for under 200, and meet the criteria above, you've found your phone, you will not regret it. Great job HTC, if I was gonna finally make the jump from my beloved physical keyboard slider style phone, I'm glad it's this device I made that big jump to. Only thing that could make it better in my opinion is a removable battery, and a slide out keyboard, although HTC appears long done with them, shame that it is.",2014年12月10日 在美国审核

Better than any other Virgin Mobile phone I've had,"I previously had the LG Volt through Virgin Mobile, and it had all kinds of bugs and issues. This phone works like a charm. It is huge! I knew that it would be big, but actually receiving it, I can't believe how big it looks (I am 5'2 and have tiny hands haha). I would give this phone a 5 if it weren't for some weird layout issues. Unlike other Android models, this phone does not have a menu key on the home page. I find that odd. I also think that the lock screen could be more customizable. I have seen far less superior phones with better customization. But, overall this is a fabulous non-flagship phone.

GREAT BUY!,"I've had this phone for about 4 days and I love it! I had a LG Optimus F3 that was also prepaid virgin mobile but I was looking mainly for a bigger screen.

(A problem I had with my LG)Apps load fast, isn't any noticeable delay.DRAWBACKSHave to charge the battery after about a day and half. (If I don't really use it.) I try to keep it on power save mode.Plastic on the back is prone to fingerprints.8GB of storage isn't a lot after all the downloads already preloaded it leaves you with about 4GB. I bought a 32 GB Sandisk SD card for about $12.00 off amazon and the phone has no problem with it.Note: Make sure you wait till Virgin Mobile already downloads ""Virgin Mobile Essentials"" onto it before you do anything. As soon as I got it I fixed it how I wanted and restarted it and it downloaded a whole new layout. So I had to go back and download my apps and ""customize"" all over again. Isn't not permanent, you can fix it. Its just a hassle to do it all over again. Essentials didn't download until about a few ours after I activated it, so maybe wait a little while and restart before you fix it how you want.Overall anything I foundslightly wrong with it, doesn't really bother me.

Nice upgrade from HTC EVO on Virgin Mobile,"I love the phone – best I have ever had.The phone works, as it should.No dropped calls in the first month.Voicemail is much louder on the better speakers, and when I turn the phone speaker on, I can hear the phone from across the room.There is plenty of storage for my apps.One of the reasons I upgraded from my HTC Evo 4G was that I had to delete an app so that I could get its latest update.Not a problem with the HTC 816.The SanDisk Memory Zone app tells me that the internal memory has 4.2 GB truly available for storage – I’ve loaded all the apps I wanted, and including the ones that cannot be moved to the SD card, I still have 1.5 GB free of internal storage – plus 29 GB free on the 32 GB memory card.The battery life is much better for me than was the Evo.I charge this phone every three days: The Evo needed it at least daily.I use this for navigation, using GPS and Waze.Works well and is easy to see.I listen to Podcasts and read books via the Kindle app.Web surfing via Google and Chrome work fast.I’ve watched a couple of Netflix movies while waiting for my vehicles to be serviced.Good picture, sound – no “buffering” that I remember.Audible works fine, as does TuneIn Radio.The camera is good enough for me: I can easily “share” the videos or pics I take to Google Drive, among other places.The setup was quick – all my apps came over from my Evo and I did not do anything to make that happened!I had to sign in with my Gmail account and everything worked!I like the size, I like the phone, I like that this is about $600 LESS than the same equipped iPhone 6 plus.Highly recommended!Update:After one year's use, I still love it.File Manager app makes it easy to delete junk that accumulates on the phone - the SD Card is great for moving apps.HTC or VirginMobile or somebody upgraded this to Lollipop 5.0.2 - It is still the best phone available for VM at less than $200.",2014年10月24日 在美国审核

As you can imagine I was very skeptical of the discount but thankfully there were no loopholes or hidden fees. The phone itself has several great features. First of all I have received many compliments on the size and its very convenient for Netflix or tv lovers. Secondly the speakers are amazing and so vivid. The camera is decent , it has good quality but not comparable to phones such as the IPhone. Download speeds are super fast. So if you are like I was, in search of an affordable IPhone deal or of equal value you are most likely not going to find one as good as this. The reviews were really helpful and I'm glad I took them into consideration. I am really satisfied with my choice and it's been about a month since I purchased.",2014年10月20日 在美国审核
"Solid phone, needs more space.","Pros: Very usable for a mid-range Android phone.Front-facing speakers are a nice plus if you ever find yourself in need of an audio source out of the blue or if (like me) you like to listen to music/podcasts in the shower and you don't have a BT speaker handy.No outsized performance issues, even with what looks like ~1.4G of usable RAM.Battery life is good - I'm a heavy data user and keep my device at 50% brightness, I can get a full day easily with the battery at around 20% by the time I'm going to bed.Cons: The 8G of storage is pretty limiting; I'm constantly having to shuffle apps, and VM's bloatware takes up a solid chunk of that already limited capacity (about 4 gigs.)And it's not exactly easy to push apps to a Micro SD and run it from there.Also, the display might be too big for most people's hands, but hopefully you know what you're getting into if you're getting a 5.5"" phone.Overall, really solid phone - just send VM's apps back to factory default and disable them to free up some room for things you'll actually use.",2016年1月25日 在美国审核
Decent phone that gets the job done. Would be a great phone if it wasn't for only 8gbs of internal storage,"This is a review of the phone itself. Not virgin mobile service, thereforeI will not be going into network serviceOverall it is a decent phone. It has one MAJOR flaw though.The big CONInternal Memory - This device only has 8gbs of internal memory. Yes I am being serious. That is barely enough for system resources, let alone additional apps, photos, music, etc. Seriously even before the Android 5.0 lollipop update I noticed this problem. What is annoying is that this phone comes stock with quite a few apps. These apps take up a lot of the 8gb of space. Most of them are useless. For whatever reason you can not uninstall them or completely move them to your SD card (which i do have..you NEED one with this phone). Because of this issue I have only been able to download only a few apps, only the essentials such as uber, skype. Many times some of my apps cant even update because there isn't just enough space. It is extremely frustrating. And with the impending new android updates, this is only going to get worse.One other thing i found annoying was that there is no removable battery.Pros720p screen and a large screen. - I hate phones with high resolution but the screen is too small to even enjoy. This is not the case.Speakers - Amazing sound. Hands down best speaker quality in any phone i have seen in years.Affordable - Less than $200. No complaints here.Camera - Megapixels on the front back camera are great.Battery life - as of now with powersaver enabled the phone lasts all day with average use.Last note??Processor?? - So this can either be a pro or con depending on how your perspective. The phone has a weaker processor than the average current smart phone. This was done to reduce price. The only time I notice a delay or lag is with taking pictures. I have not seen this with any other app.",2015年8月14日 在美国审核
TOTAL GARBAGE!,"Purchased this phone in September of 2014 and for the first six months it was a decent phone, it was slow to respond and didn't live up to promised 4G speeds but I could live with that. After about six months it started dropping calls. In the last three months the touch screen started to become unresponsive basically it had good days and bad days and has gotten progressively worse. And now it will only connect to the about 30% of the time, I know it is the phone because my Niece also has Virgin Mobile and has no problem connecting to the network. I have tried restarting it and turning it of for periods of time and it does not help also ran antivirus through it and that was not the problem either. One of my first phone was a $20 Tracfonethat would do similar things but if I pulled the battery out it would reset and be fine but you cannot do that with this phone because the battery is sealed, another inconvenience. All in all I consider this phone to be a complete waste of money and will never purchase another HTC product, I purchased it to replace my very reliable Samsung Reverb because I wanted faster connect speeds BIG mistake. I would encourage anyone thinking of purchasing this to not waste the money it is GARBAGE!",2015年7月31日 在美国审核

Hoping it will be better when I get the 2nd one,"I might be the unlucky one: got this phone for few weeks, (1) the battery drained crazily (from 87% down to 7% in couple house at idle mode and extreme power saving mode on). (2) GPS signal has been never detected. We kept trying to use it while driving from Jacksonville, FL to Lake Park/ Valdosta, GA. The GPS kept locating and ended up ""GPS signal lost"". (3) The led light has never been on even I set notification light on. (4) Don't know what ""Smith expired"" (hardware bug) is. It keeps popping up every time I restarted the phone. (5) The newest Android 4.4 system does has constraint - there is no built-in file/ folder explorer. Even you download one from google play, you still can't make change/ delete any files from the external SD card. I don't get it why they did that.I, however, didn't hear much people (who gave positive feedback) that battery drain and GPS were problems. So I gave it a try and sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Hoping it will be better when I get the 2nd one. I do like the big screen (5.5"") for 40 something like me but don't want to put on the reading glasses.

"Pretty amazing for a midrange phone. Overview, coming from a Moto G 2013","The size (it is big) and the design of the front, with the matte texture on front and around the sides looks premium, definitely an eye catcher. The back, no so much. A pale grey, glossy fingerprint magnet. No matter, slap on a cheap (price wise, quality case) Noot Basic case like I did, which is also matte, really compliments the phone, and it looks fantastic. Your friends will be jealous for sure. Would've rather had a protective case, but no otterbox support, and all the available knockoff ones for this phone look cheap, and I prefer to keep the premium look and feel of the phone with a slim case. Also I recommend you slap on a tempered glass screen protector as well. That combo makes the phone looks super classy high end.The power button, although in an unusual place (top left), is easy to get used to, and the ""normal"" placement on other phone now feels a bit weird to me. It's all muscle memory. But that and the volume rocker are quite wobbly and lack thatreassuring ""click"" response on most other phones like my old moto g. But not a big deal.The screen is big. Not too big, just right. This is my first ""phablet"" and I really don't see myself ever going back to a ""regular"" size phone. 5.5"", at 720p HD. Looks fantastic. Not the sharpest, but more than sharp enough, and colors look a bit washed out (not as vibrant) when put side by side to the moto g, but a great looking screen nonetheless.This uses the same CPU chipset as the moto g, but it's clocked faster (1.6Ghz vs 1.2), and has more ram (1.5gb vs 1gb). And honestly it makes a huge difference. Unlike the moto g, and pretty much all phones with 1gb or less, with that extra RAM you can have several apps in the background, and open them up right back up, without them having to reload. And the higher clock speed means the screen feels much more responsive, apps open and close much faster, and scrolling on the web or on facebook is much more smooth. The only ""lag"" I've noticed with general use is sometimes swiping through homescreens can feel sluggish. Not sure why, even with no apps running and Blinkfeed turned off. Maybe it's just my device, but not a big deal.The GPU that comes with the chipset isn't the best, graphics intensive games are playable, but I wouldn't call it smooth. But casual games (candy crush, temple run, etc) run fine. All and all, performance wise, gaming is basically what you'd expect for the price, but general use is dare I say almost comparable to flagship phones I've messed with. Real smooth.The cameras are flagship worthy. No doubt about it. My moto G had a 5 megapixel primary camera. The FRONT camera on this phone is 5 megapixels, and the back matches some flagships at 13 MP. Sure, MP count isn't everything, it's the quality of the sensor. But HTC didn't slouch. Pictures taken outside in good light blow away any other phone in this price range. Low light shots are exceptional as well, no other ~300$ off contract phone can touch this phones camera quality.If you're a spec person and have looked into this phone you've probably seen that NFC is only on certain models. This model DOES have NFC. Very good to see.It also runs on 4G LTE. If you're used to a 3G only phone, the data speeds crazy fast, no more youtube buffering, it's night and day.Saving the best feature for last, as a music lover, the front facing Boomsound speakers are ridiculous. At half volume, it's loud enough for a room. And at full volume, it fills my friend's apartment. And it's not just loud, it's clear, not ""tinny"" in the least bit like every other phone out there with a single speaker, it's produces a full sound and it actually has some bass to it! No need for an external bluetooth speaker. And there's two speakers, so it's stereo, hold it in landscape while watching a music video or movie and you get that full, left to right sound experience. Pair that with the big nice screen and the media experience is just amazing.All in all, this a a fantastic phone, and even better is the price. You get fast, smooth performance, on a big, great looking screen. Cameras near worthy of a flagship. And HTCs trademark front facing Boomsound speakers. All for about 180$ on amazon. No doubt the best phone Virgin Mobile offers that's not 600+$, and a really great phone in general. No, don't get the LG Volt, the kyocera, don't get the cheaper htc desire 510 (cousin has it, it's crap), get this. I promise you'll love it.

Very pleased with this phone so far,"Very pleased with this phone so far.I was a little nervous ordering an HTC, as my previous HTC phone was so-so, but this one is fast, has a nice big screen (size-wise, same dimensions as the iPhone 6 Plus), good built-in features (the standard music player actually lets me edit playlists in an intelligent way that EVERY music player should but almost none do), and despite what I've read in other reviews, the camera seems fine and the battery life is excellent.I'm sure the top-end Samsung Galaxy and iPhone competitors are better in many respects, but for $200, and a $35/month unlimited everything plan, I am completely satisfied.My only wish is that it came with 16 GB internal memory instead of 8, but 8 is still an improvement over all my previous phones, so I can live with it.Adding June 2015: Again I am still pleased with this phone in most ways, but I have to add a caveat: the 8 GB internal memory is getting to be very limiting.I did a factory reset on my phone, let the OS and all the pre-installed apps update (we do have Android 5.02 now), and when it was done, they took up over 6 GB.That doesn't leave a whole lot of room for other apps.HTC has added to the load of bloatware with many apps which I don't need, are redundant, or where I prefer another app for the purpose.Google also installs its full suite of apps, many of which I don't use.And of course you can't remove any of these or move them to the sdCard.I'm still not sorry I bought the phone, but I can't really recommend it to new purchasers at this point; the way things are going you won't have *any* room for personal apps before long.(Virgin has also apparently announced they are not going to upgrade it to the next version of Android, and has stopped carrying the phone on their site -- there are rumors that they are going to sell out to someone else soon, so you might want to hold off on purchasing or upgrading any Virgin phone till things are more definite.)",2014年12月28日 在美国审核
"None of these ""cheap"" lollipop phones have enough memory! Thanks a lot HTC!","I bought this phone in November of 2014, hoping that this would be the answer to my wishes (being able to keep all of my apps as further updates would surely follow the purchase).Unfortunately, my wishes were smashed to bits. Let me preface by saying that I don't know how to nor do I ROOT phones. I have purchased several so-called 8GB internal memory phones only to find out that there isn't enough room to update the apps.And YES, I did experiment with moving (a percentage of ) apps to my added on mini SD card. Like every other phone, you can't really add the ""app"" to the SD card, but rather what you use for that app (photos, music, book prefs). I did all I could to avoid updating bloat apps (HTC, GOOGLE, etc.) to no avail. Before the last update that I put off for over a week, I went from 0.63 GB of free space to 0.37 GB of free space. That means that I can't update any blessed apps that I want to, like AMAZON, KINDLE, AVAST, SKYPE without either moving something to the card or removing app(s).It would appear that I'm not shooting high enough. Perhaps I need more memory, like what galaxy phones allegedly have. Problem is, I don't want a contract and can't afford the S6. That leaves older phones with older batteries because they are no longer made. Most of which won't allow you to remove the battery to replace that.I just can't win.",2015年8月31日 在美国审核

The last of Virgin Mobile's affordable quality phones,"If you're like me, you probably ended up here when your semi-reliable, affordable VM phone started looking dog-eared and battle damaged and the time came to look for an upgrade. Naturally, you tried going to your usual outlet in recent months, whether it's Virgin's own website or one of their affiliated stores (minus Radio Shack. Rip.) and have seen what a dismal selection of phones they've had available to buy lately. Seriously.....What the frick happened?? They used to have really great phones like This one, The Evo 3D, The Galaxy S3.....hell, iPHONES! Can't go wrong with those, right? Even if they do cost a pretty penny.Now all they've got is the LG Volt, The LG Tribute-to-the-Volt, A Windows phone (lol), Whatever latest plastic toy crap got foisted on them from Kyocera, and of course the Galaxy S5, if you're willing to part with a couple limbs, your immortal soul and your first born child (still a bargain compared to Verizon).Between the lack of viable phones and the UTTERLY confusing discrepancies between their existing data plans, the custom plans and whatever the hell exclusive data plan thing they're doing with Wal-Mart which, by the way, uses many of the SAME [*bleep*] phones but somehow still requires a new account and a $20 starter kit, sometimes it's tough being a loyal Virgin Mobile customer who just wants a new phone.Find your way here to get a hold-over phone like this one, though, and it reminds you why it's worth it.Out of the box, it's already an impressive piece of hardware. Huge 5.5"" HD Screen, 13 MP camera with a 5MP front-facing selfie cam, Loud dual front facing speakers, Blazing 4G LTE support and a Quad-core processor.This phone eats other prepaid phones for breakfast and frightens pants pockets. And that's BEFORE the over the air upgrade from Android 4.4 Kitkat to 5.0.2 Lollipop that's available right off the bat. The HTC Sense overlay is present, of course, but is not as intrusive as previous iterations and you can get fairly close to a core android experience on this phone with some time and a few tweaks.The only downer is the battery is integrated, so there's no swapping it out. If the charge retention of the battery goes down over long periods of use, you're stuck with it, just like with an iPhone.....but if you keep a charger handy, it shouldn't be a huge issue in the long run. The battery life is actually really good once you get rid of useless power sinks like the ""Blinkfeed"" on the homescreen.Also, this is a huge phone. Bigger than even the picture lets on.....so it may be prudent to invest in some protective casing and a holster for it. It won't fit in most pockets without risk of damage, so a holster is essential. I personally recommend the E-Time Armor case and holster (also available here for just $6.00). You will also need to get an SD card for storage space as it does not come with one and only has about 8 GB of on-board space that is already mostly occupied.The way things have been going, this could very well be the last of Virgin Mobile's affordable, truly quality smartphones (for some time, at least), so, if you're in the market for one now, get this one while it's still available.

Also, just to add this phone has fast start-up and if you are switching from another phone it comes built it with this HTC transfer tool that allows you to transfer everything over to this one but, if transferring from an Android you need to download that app first on your old phone and I think for iPhones you need to transfer your info to a PC then transfer via USB cable.",2015年2月18日 在美国审核

It is 720p which is lower than high end phones (1080p), but the difference is hardly noticeable. The contrast and colors are near flawless. Sound is amazing, probably the best I've heard on a phone. Camera is 13mp but doesn't take fantastic photos. Photos don't look bad at all, just not great. Kind of a shame due to the fact the rest of the phone is so high quality.

Very nice HTC for Virgin Mobile!,"Very nice mid-range android phone. Quite large. Not really a pocket phone. My last HTC was 4.5 inches and fit well in my front pocket. I use a holster and case for this ""beast"". It's bigger than I had imagined it to be. I purchased on Amazon without seeing it first. It's not a bad thing that the phone is huge, just keep it in mind if you keep it in your pocket. It's fast, smooth, loud, and has a very nice screen. The battery lasts me all day with basic usage (a couple calls, some texting, some web, and emailing). It does eat battery fairly quick if you do video streaming. The BOOM sound is nice. I really like HTC and Virgin Mobile. They work well together. The battery IS NOT removable.

The rear facing camera is pretty good, although the zoom isn't the best. The front facing is where it lacks. The photos and selfies taken with the front facing sometimes turn out pixelated, the color is dull and lacking. The overall feel of the phone is ok. The back of the phone is an annoying sticky plastic material that smudges easily and makes the phone feel cheap.

But when it comes to the front camera, although the specs say 5 megapixels, it didn't mention that the front camera seems to be zoomed in. If my arms were 2 feet longer, I'd be happy, but they're not and I'm not too pleased. Even at full arms length, my selfies come out too close. The internal storage isn't my favorite either.

"Fair price, but you get what you pay for.","I bought this to replace my Galaxy SIII. This was a little cheaper and I figured I'd try something new. Now, all-around it's not a bad phone. However, I wish I'd just gotten another SIII.I'll knock my biggest pet peeve out of the way first. This thing is PACKED with bloatware and none of it can be uninstalled. Over half your memory will be thrown away because of it. This wouldn't be so bad if there was a micro-SD slot, but there isn't. So if storage is an issue for you, do yourself a favor and stop investigating this phone.Next comes the OS. It's clunky sometimes and navigation can be weird. The HOME, WINDOWS, and CLOSE buttons are on the touchscreen, too. Not my preference either. However, I must applaud the auto correct and language recognition software. The suggested words often help me complete entire sentences much faster now.It's fair enough in the hardware department. Screen is clean and the speakers are louder than my SIII's were. The camera is okay, but the autofocus sucks most of the time.Overall, I wish I'd gotten another SIII, but this phone will suffice for now.

"excellent phone, TERRIBLE customer service with Virgin Mobile","I absolutely love this phone! I just got it last month, and I must say it is perhaps the best smartphone I've ever had! I found it on Amazon for way less than through carrier! My favorite feature is HTC Boomsound. The sound is so crisp and clear. I don't hear any static or crackles. The screen size is excellent! The battery lasts me the entire day! I normally only charge it once a day and then again right before I go to sleep. I don't like the HTC Blinkfeed feature. I feel that it's just software preloaded that bloats my phone. However, I have no problems with lag. The phone is fast, stylish, large, and the sound quality is the best! I previously had the Desire 510 and that was a great phone too, but this one blows it clear out of the water! Thanks, HTC for making an amazing phone &amp; thank you AMAZON for making it affordable!!! (:Update 6/3/16:I had this phone stolen while I was at a park with my family. I contacted Virgin Mobile and the police in my local area and filed a report of stolen property. Virgin Mobile was absolutely no help. They didn't try to track my phone and I insisted that they mark the phone as stolen in their system so that if anyone else tried to activate it, they wouldn't be able to. Well, they gave me the runaround and tried to get money out of me by making me pay for it when I wasn't even using it....Anyway, the phone is absolutely wonderful and I don't regret my purchase one bit, however, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND you buy it through someone other than Virgin Mobile.

Is this phone right for you?,"I like the phone. I was initially concerned about it's size, since I was used to a smaller phone. It took about a week for the phone to ""shrink down"" and not feel awkward anymore, in other words, I got used to it and now it feels weird when I pick up my old phone. The added real estate makes a world of difference to an old foggy like me, who wakes up every morning with a little less eyesight and a little less hair.As others have mentioned, the sound quality is amazing for such a small device. Now, it's not a heart stopping ""boom box"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it sounds great for what it is.It has a brilliant display from every angle. I have not seen a phone any clearer or sharper at any price.The cameras are pretty good. I've always had cameras on my cell phones, but I hardly ever used them because I'm a hobby photographer and I don't shoot with anything less than a DSLR. However, I can see myself taking pictures with this one from time to time. Coming from me, that's a compliment. There are better cameras on other phones, but there is nothing wrong with the pictures or video this one can take.HTC has an app that is installed on this phone. It's some live tile application that keeps feeding you whatever you customize it to do. As aforementioned, I'm not a 12 year old girl, so I have no interest in any ""social"" media apps. I don't care who is doing what, or who said what when. Therefore, I found this app to be annoying and it took me a while to figure out how to get rid of it. If you live and breathe ""social"" media, you will love this.This phone is for Virgin mobile only. It's a great service for a great price, however, they use the Sprint network, which doesn't have that great a coverage.I don't know what a more expensive phone can do, compared to this one, but I'm certain that whatever it is, I don't need it and it's not worth an extra $400 to me. This is a quality phone with a thin and sleek design. Don't tell HTC, but I think this phone is worth far more than what I paid for it.I didn't give it 5 stars because of the HTC in your face app and because it only comes with 8 gigs of storage, 4 of which is already used up by the OS and by the bloat ware that comes installed on it.

Great phone definite buy,The Desire 816 in my opinion is one of the best phones on virgin mobile. First off the screen is a nice roomy 5.5 inch 720p display with great viewing angles and a crisp picture. Second the htc boom sound speakers sound full and rich with a decent amount of bass. Third the rear facing camera is a 13 mp shooter with flash which takes very detailed pictures and the front facing camera is a 5 mp which takes some pretty good selfies. Fourth the snapdragon 400 processor is quick and snappy. The only cons I have for this phone is the funky power button placement and the fingerprint magnet back. But overall this phone is a great mid range phone and is worth checking out a 4 out of 5.P.S. Not a phone for those with little hands.,2014年10月31日 在美国审核

I love everything about this phone with the exception of the ...,"I wanted to wait to rate this phone until I had used it for a while and could give an informed review. I have been using this phone now since August of 2015. I love everything about this phone with the exception of the Internal storage, which is only 8gb. I would rate the phone higher except that after only 6 months I will have to buy another phone or root this one. This is a mid-range phone. I understand that. Maybe I'm just expecting to much. The real problem is that nearly half of the internal storage is already taken up by the pre-loaded bloatware (which you are not allowed to delete) and the OS leaving you just over 4gb for personal use.. until the OS updates and then you have less than 4gb (at least in my experience). The phone has updated several times since then. I keep deleting apps so it can continue to do so. It does allow for an Micro SD but most apps will not load to it. This isn't the fault of the manufacturer but the unnecessary and uninstallable bloatware certainly is. I would gladly pay more for an this phone if I could get it with 16gb instead. I am now at a point where I can no longer update the OS or any of my apps. I'm not gaming on my phone. Most of my apps pertain to a couple of credit cards, some online shopping apps, my online banking, Anti-Virus and my health care apps. Everything that can be moved to the SD card has been moved. If you use very few apps then this phone is wonderful. I wish I could find a replacement for it with a larger internal storage but until then I guess I am going back to Galaxy.02/04/16 UpdateI decided to try rooting the phone before giving up entirely on it. I had to go to the HTC website to get the unlock code to unlock the boot first and it was no easy task. I wouldn't recommend trying to unlock your boot or rooting your phone if you are not pretty comfortable using a computer. I did manage to get back about a gig of storage after I flashed a new and smaller GAPPs package (the google apps package that comes preinstalled on your phone). Once this was done, my phone OS was finally able to update again and now I am back down to almost no internal storage.Virgin Mobile USA has a new phone option available for 2016 which I am going to try. The Samsung Galaxy J3. It comes with 16gb of internal storage. Some specs are not as nice as my HTC Desire 816 and it has a higher price tag of around $180.00 but at least the storage is something I can work with.",2016年1月26日 在美国审核

Excellent Phone,"I've had my HTC Desire 816 for a little over a year now and I can honestly say this is the best phone I've ever had. I purchased the phone on a little bit of a whim after my S3 started getting glitchy and the charging port stopped working. I initially wanted to stay with the Samsung Galaxy line but the S5 was too much for me at $500. Now I have no urge to buy a Galaxy product again.The 816 is a large phone, bigger than a Note 2, but I find it very comfortable to hold. It has a dual sim option as well as an expandable SD slot. It rings loudly and it's easy to hear someone you're having a conversation with. I never have a problem with getting a clear signal, even while traveling in big cities or the middle of nowhere. The back camera takes excellent photos. I can multitask with no problems. The battery life is better than my S3. With heavy use the phone lasts about 6 hours, medium use 12+ hours, minimal use at least a day and a half. I enjoy the different ways I can customize the phone with minimal effort using pre-made themes or by creating my own, hiding or arranging apps in the menu as I see fit, making custom ringtones from music on my SD card and more. The speakers are on the front of the phone instead of the back, so when listening to music without headphones I can leave my phone face up without the sound being muffled.The cons for the phone are that the front facing camera often force closes, the headphone jack is easily bumped and disconnected, and it comes with quite a bit of bloatware from Virgin Mobile, Google, and HTC. I've disabled or uninstalled most of it, but intend on rooting the phone to further clear it out. Other nitpicky things are that the notifications bar is very cluttered, the LED notification light is only red and green with no options for other colors, and Dot View is not supported by the phone but you cannot disable it.All in all I'm very happy with my purchase and I hope Virgin Mobile continues to add HTC phones to their lineup.",2016年2月13日 在美国审核

if your'e deciding between this and the volt - go with this!,"This phone is amazing. I haven't set it up yet since I've only had it for about an hour. But I love it. It's replacing my sprint galaxy s3.I never disliked my galaxy but I've gotten use to my galaxy tab s 8.4 - so the bigger screen size on this phone isn't too much of an adjustment.This feels like a great phone it actually fits in my hand better. Although I don't have a case on it yet and my galaxy had an otterbox. Which is going to be really nice for resale value since it protected it perfectly over the past two years - but it jumped out of my hands about 50 times so the otterbox was more cumbersome it seemed. And at this price point, with a standard gel case - if I do break the phone it won't break the bank to replace.The best part about this phone though - bought it on Sunday afternoon and here, Tuesday afternoon it is with free shipping. Guess there's an amazon warehouse on the other side of my state now.*UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE* - VIRGIN MOBILE SERVICE IS AMAZING.My work is notorious for having zero cell service inside. AT&amp;T was the only carrier that anyone ever received service inside where they could make regular calls. That is until I purchased this phone and set it up through virgin mobile. I had sprint before and I could not make a call 99% of the time until I was down the street from my work. Well I just made a call from inside to another skeptics phone(which went to their voicemail) and they were in shock when I put the call on speaker. They tried to tell me my service was lousy and that I left a perfectly good carrier(sprint)Well I just made a call and sent a text just fine from inside our aluminum cell block. It is official. whether it's virgin mobile or the HTC 816 or the two together. This carrier and phone just hit my all time best buy list. Thanks amazon, virgin mobile, htc... I feel like I just one the little league world series.*UPDATE*So after using this phone for a few weeks it's still amazing. Such a great deal. It is in fact, the perfect size for a phone ever.It never flies out of my hand like my GS3 did(although I had a clunker otterbox on it which is just awkward to hold) And let me tell you this, the SLOW MO video makes it sooooooo much better. You need a decent amount of light(this goes for almost any device doing this task) but it's slow mo looks incredible. I tried explaining it's awesomeness to my brother(who claimed his phone has that) and had to interupt him and say- ""No. This is not the samsung galaxy class video slowed down.

"Good if you like HTC Apps, Annoying if you Don't","I've had this phone nearly a year and it is annoying. The internal storage is dismal if you try to use anything but the default HTC apps.

So be ready to embrace the hard coded HTC apps or suffer.The camera, the main appeal to me, doesn't live up to its 13MP potential. Although, it is a very good camera for a phone and it will be hard to find a similarly priced alternative. The battery drains fast when in use, but can last a while with the right apps in standby mode. I still need to carry my charger to work every day.Lastly, this phone is pretty large.

Great phone overall.,Shipping was fast (with Amazon Prime) The package came in a box with bubble protection. Phone came in Virgin Mobile retail packaging.Set up is easy with an existing Virgin Mobile account. The phone came preloaded with a bunch of apps that took up almost half of the 8GB of memory on the phone. Battery life isn't all that great probably because of all the apps running in the background. BUT the phone is great. Nice set up and layout. Extremely nice camera. Snapdragon makes the phone move really fast. LTE is great too!,2015年6月11日 在美国审核

Solid device. Software/Hardware flaws,"I have had two of these devices in less than 30 days. The first one had reception problems and the second one encountered a seemingly common error. (Smith - Disabled) I lost 4G connectivity when the error appeared. Nothing seems to clear the error permanently. I restarted the device, cleared the data in the app, checked for updates, and updated the profile and PRL with no success. I must say my overall experience with the phone itself was pleasant.The screen and performance was great, however the battery life left a bit to be desired. This was overcome by installing and configuring Green Power Battery Saver Pro and AutomateIT Pro. Standby battery life was increased from ~ 1 day to ~ 5 days with normal/regular usage after the applications were installed. I hope no one else has these issues as this is a solidly built device with one external exception. The backing is really slick, so I suggest holding onto the rubberish sides. I would suggest using a case or adding a skin, however I never use a case other than for storage and I have ordered a skin but it has not arrived.",2014年10月15日 在美国审核
"Oh...great, my wife hates me now...","I have had this phone for 9 months and it MOSTLY works great. It's fast, its got a nice screen, and it takes great pictures. However it has one tiny flaw...It needs to be rebooted about every 8 hours otherwise it stops receiving all data, calls, and texts. This phone is literally ruining my marriage. Luckily my wife believes me when I say my phone is a piece of crap when I show her the empty received call log and the time-stamp of her increasingly pissed off text messages. Not only this but I cannot reliably use this phone for work and I have absolutely no idea how many calls I have missed from paying clients.In summary its a great phone...if you can get passed the part that it WILL eventually ruin your life. I will never...ever...buy another HTC product. Even my cheap Samsung never ceased to communicate to and from its network.",2016年5月11日 在美国审核
GREAT PHONE BUT WITH DOWNSIDES,"The phone came in only two days and it's just as described. It's about the same size as the iPhone 6+ and has a lot of useful features. The rear-facing camera takes clear photos and works great outside. There's also a lot of options that allow you to adjust the camera settings. The front-facing camera was better than I expected; it took pretty good photos. The snapchat selfies are on point! The soundboom speakers are loud and clear with a little bit of bang; it sounds like it's coming from a bluetooth speaker. The screen is bright and vibrant and the phone's fast. The back of the phone is plastic and a tad bit slippery so I recommend getting a phone case. It says it comes with 8 gb of storage but only 4 of those 8 gb are available for use. You can easily buy a micro sd card to add more space if four isn't enough for you. The lock screenbutton and volume rocker keys are on the same side and I sometimes find myself locking my phone screen when I'm trying to turn the volume up and vice versa. The lock screen button is also a little hard to reach since it's so high up but it's not too big of a deal. Overall, it's still a great phoneand I'd recommend it if you like large phones and taking quality photos",2015年3月3日 在美国审核

Phone has 8 gb of memory but 4gb is filled up with bloatware. A micro sd card purchase is pretty much mandatory with this phone so you have some room to store apps and pic files. Absolute worst problem with this phone however is the camera. It is utter garbage. Picture quality is extremely poor and blurs easily.

"Good Software, Terrible Hardware","When I first received the phone in the mail I was thrilled. It worked wonderfully. I had no complaints about the durability of the phone or its functionality. Within the course of three months, the phone screen now has trouble responding to touch, and in some places won't respond to any touch. I have tried all of the suggested fixes that Virgin Mobile offered, and none of them worked. Now my Sim Card is not staying in its slot, which makes it very difficult to use many of the phone's features. The phone has never been dropped, spilled on, submerged in liquid, or been subjected to any physical damage. I have a case for it and have used screen protectors. I used it regularly and carry it in my pocket, which is common for anyone with a smart phone. I am extremely disappointed in the product and the fact that it is barely usable so shortly after purchasing. This phone is five stars on the technological side of things, but as far as durability and dependability go, it doesn't even deserve one star.

Awesome phone!,"I've had this phone for a few weeks, and it is fantastic. It is super smooth and fast, nothing can slow this thing down.It has a great 13MP camera in the back, you'll be hard pressed to find a smartphone that comes with a better camera.The front camera is amazingly high-quality as well. The screen looks great (c'mon, who needs 1080p on a screen this size?), and it feels great in your hand. The battery life is good: when it's sitting in your pocket it consumes hardly any battery, unlike my old phone.I've put this through a variety of rigorous tests: recording 50 minutes of HD video, playing an advanced 3D game, getting directions on the fly, even dropping it from a short height.It passed all of them with near perfection.Of course I did see some serious battery drain on the video and game, but that's to be expected and it still lasted through the day.The only downside is that it's a little big, and while it still fits in my jeans pocket it takes up all the space.But that's a small price to pay given that it's a great phone in all other areas and only costs $200.There isn't much internal storage space, but a 32GB microSD card will take care of that for only $18.Then you'll probably want to protect your screen from falls and scratches without adding bulk, I recommend a tempered glass screen protector which can be had for around $13.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核

Then my phone kept dinging. I un-installed the software and went to system restore and all my restore points were gone. I checked to make sure they were there before creating this point - (BEFORE HTC SYNC). Called htc and they said it was a windows problem and not theirs. Call Microsoft? Why?
