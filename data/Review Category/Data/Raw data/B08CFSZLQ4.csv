Got the Basics Down,"Great phone if you just want the basics to do everyday tasks (e-mail, social media, selfies, take pictures of random stuff, Youtube, streaming video, online shopping, etc) without the bells and whistles.$350 is an excellent price for what it can do especially if you're on a budget.Unlike a premium $800+ phone it does NOT have1. Water, Dust Resistance. Have that bag of rice handy just in case, and don't kick it around constantly in dry dirt/sand2. Active Edge. Unlike the past few pixel phones, cannot squeeze phone for Google Assistant3. Facial recognition. Has a very responsive fingerprint reader on back.4. 4K screen. Has 1080p OLED display, 60hz refresh. If your eyes are used to 4k screens with high refresh rate then this may feel like a downgrade, if not, it's manageable. Able to multi-task without any lag (unless your eyes are trained to do so)5. Wireless charging. Wired fast charging only.6. Aluminum or glass body: Phone exterior has a uni-body plastic design. Sturdy and fingerprint resistant7. Support 5G. There is a 5g model coming soon (as of this review)--What it does have/list of features:Excellent camera: Single camera front and back (12MP). No wide angle. excellent post processing software. One of the best cameras on the market (as of this review) even when compared to $1000+ phones especially in astro photography. Front camera is a whole punch design instead of integrated into a bezel.Great Battery life: 10 hour screen on time. Can last 1 to 1.5 days depending on usageIt does have headphone jack for those who still use wired headphonesStereo speakers are basic. Able to hear others through speaker phone. Decent bass if you want to listen to music without headphones128gb storageE-sim option. No need for physical sim if you don't want to use itHas live Caption mode (basically subtitles for your phone for media and phone calls), and Now Playing (tells you what music is playing without going into an app)Has 3 year software and security updates. No bloutwear on phoneOverall, excellent price for what you get especially when you want the phone to do basic everyday tasks",2020年8月20日 在美国审核

"Pros: Headphone jack, unlocakble bootloader, minimal bloatware. Cons: Almost everything else.","If you want to buy an US Android smartphone that has minimal out-of-the-box bloatware, a headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, great camera, and an unlockable bootloader, there is only one phone on the market that meets that criteria, the Pixel 4a. I personally desire these features on my smartphone, but manufacturers have been removing them from their flagship smartphones from sometime. I used to only buy smartphone flagships and was always excited to upgrade. I purchased the first Google Pixel XL on launch day back in 2016 and it has been the best phone I’ve ever used. I loved my Pixel XL so much I have tried to replace it twice but ended up selling the newer phones as I considered them to be inferior. My Pixel XL stopped receiving software updates from Google a while back, but I’ve been able to extend its lifespan by loading LineageOS on it.Subsequent Pixel flagships have removed several features I want on my phone or added features I did not want. The Pixel 2 series removed the headphone jack, the Pixel 3XL had an ugly notch mimicking the iPhone X, and the Pixel 4 (non-A) series does not have fingerprint sensors.It really does not make sense that the Pixel 4a, a budget offering, has more features than the Pixel 4, but this is the reality we live in. I’d like to quickly run over the things I love about this device before I start tearing into with criticism. I love that it has a headphone jack. I have no problem with wireless technology, but Bluetooth in 2020 still provides inferior sound quality when compared to a wired connection. When I’m in my car or listening to headphones, I want a wired connection for the best quality possible. Wired headphones also don’t require batteries meaning they are much more environmentally friendly and never require battery replacement.I also love that this phone has an unlockable bootloader. If you want to keep this phone past the 3 year window of software support Google offers, you can load an aftermarket ROM on your device like LineageOS. It’s also a plus if you want to root your device. Many smartphone manufacturers (Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, Motorola, to name a few) either don’t allow this or limit the functionality to certain models which I consider unacceptable. Can you imagine if you bought a computer with Windows 7 but were forbidden from loading Windows 8 or Ubuntu on it? You don’t have to imagine, that’s essentially what most smartphone manufacturers do. Google doesn’t and I appreciate that.While an unlockable bootloader is nice, I would say that most people would like to use their new phones with out-of-box software as long as possible. Google’s version of Android is the closest thing to pure/bloatware-free that you can get. There are no duplicate apps (except YouTube/YouTube Music), and almost everything can be uninstalled or disabled out of the box. Mine did come with a T-Mobile app which I saw as strange since it’s an unlocked phone, but I was able to uninstall it. This is what I like to see. Other brands such as Samsung have gone as far as to create entire duplicate app stores, calendars, mail apps, assistants, and internet browsers that are not removable from their phones. Others, like OnePlus, now put Facebook services on phones out of the box. I am glad that Google has not embraced these practices and still leaves app choice up to the owner of the phone.The camera, like on all Pixel phones, is fantastic. Great low-light performance and amazing detail, contrast, and color. No other smartphone on the market can compare with the Pixel series of phones when it comes to cameras. Both the front and rear shooters take great shots, but for reasons I’ll get to later, I hate the front camera.So what are the compromises? This thing is cheap, gross, fingerprint-attractive plastic. In all honesty, I hate all plastic. Plastic is what disposable products are made from. I don’t want a plastic phone. Make it out of aluminum, steel, glass, whatever. But plastic is not acceptable on any smartphone in 2020, even a budget one. Immediately when I took this phone out of the box I hated how it felt in my hand. It feels like a kid’s tox, reminiscent of the iPhone 5c. You may think this is being harsh on a $350 phone but the iPhone SE 2 is made from aluminum and is the same price. The aesthetic design of the phone isn't too bad, if it were made of aluminum it would be a nice looking phone, that is, if it weren't for what I'll get into next.The screen is horrible. It’s only 1080p-equivalent (my Pixel XL from 2016 is 1440p, it’s not wide enough for my taste, and rather than have a bezel on the top of the phone like on the Pixel 4, Google instead decided to embrace the hole punch-style front camera design popularized by Samsung. Whenever you look at this phone, you are going to see this camera. It sticks out like a sore thumb, a giant black mark on the screen. It’s even worse when you’re watching videos in portrait mode, as the top of the display darkens to simulate an artificial bezel. If the video you’re watching is dark then rather than seeing the beautiful perfect black scenes you can achieve with an OLED screen, you see the camera. It’s also a distraction when you’re viewing a wide photo or video in landscape mode, it’s a giant black dot on the side like a fly landed on the screen. I spend a lot of time watching videos on my phone and this is not acceptable. When in dim rooms the camera hole is also very reflective and will shine light right into your eyes, adding further distraction. The only thing I can compliment is that at least the hole is off to the side and not in the center. It’s still terrible.I’m not happy with the fingerprint sensor. It’s plastic so it feels terrible, but it also doesn’t seem to read fingerprints well. To its credit it does read quickly, much more quickly than my Pixel XL, but I find myself having to read my print three or four times just to get it to unlock. I prefer optical under-screen fingerprint sensors such as those found on the OnePlus series of phones but can accept a rear fingerprint sensor if it’s accurate and quick. The sensor on the 4a does not seem to be accurate.The battery is too small at 3140mah. There are budget Indian and Chinese phones that are packing 4000mah+ batteries into smartphones of similar size, Google is lagging behind the competition. They’ve advertised this as having “adaptive” battery optimization and while it seems to perform fairly well out of the box, how well will it perform after several major updates and a few hundred charge cycles? One of my last jobs was spent working with batteries and one of the things I learned is that when it comes to lithium-ion cells, higher capacity + lower discharge depth = longer lifespan. Even if this phone can get you through morning to night with 10-15% capacity left of a 3,140mah battery, you’ll be left with a battery lasts less long than if you had a 4000mah battery ending the day at 30% before going back on the charger. Lithium-ion cells also degrade as they’re cycled. After 100 cycles a Lithium battery can lose as much as 5%-10% of its capacity. If you start with a larger cell then that degradation will be less of an issue as age sets in. Needless to say, Google fumbled on battery size.I think this is the best new Android phone on the market, but in the same breath, I think that reflects poorly on the Android smartphone market. You might think my criticisms are harsh considering the low price of the phone, but I did not buy this phone because it was cheap. I bought it because it has the features I want. If I had the option of buying a flagship smartphone with a headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, metal/glass body, excellent camera, large battery, no hole punch, and no bloatware, I would buy that. I can’t buy a new flagship smartphone like that so this is the next closest thing. I’m not even asking for luxury features like wireless charging. Basically, I feel no guilt in being critical towards the device’s flaws because my desires as a consumer are not being met by the companies I’m purchasing from. I would recommend this device if you need the features it has.",2020年8月24日 在美国审核
"Decent quality, good price, but read why.","I finally switched from Samsung and Motorola phones to a Pixel. I had read a lot of websites extolling how good of a price it was based on the features and decided to give it a chance.Overall, I would say that it is worth the money, but, having it for a few days now, there are some obvious pros and cons.Pros:Definitely the price3 years of software support/upgradesNot full of bloatwareCons:The camera takes great pictures, but the software is lacking so every time that you take a picture and want to see it, you need to wait 5 seconds before the phone processes it.There is no wireless charging.There is no facial recognition.The sound was a real letdown. It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones.The screen is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn't seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones.I definitely think it's in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying.

Google Pixel 4a for the WIN!,"This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a.After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released, I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a.One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price. I didn’t want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network. This phone was a bargain at $349, but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price.The Good: Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up. The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue. The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly. The Pixel 4a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7. It used a USB cable to connect and download everything. Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost. Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues, but nothing that couldn't be fixed.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate. It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes.It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down. The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used.Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features. This battery lasts all day long even with regular use.The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome!It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour.The Bad: The bad really isn’t all that bad when taken in proper context. There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since it’s missing some luxury features. Apparently this phone isn’t waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since I’ve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water. Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.It really isn't a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway.This phone does take a USC-C cable so it isn't compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices, which use Micro USB cables.It comes with one USB-C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car.Again, not a huge deal because of the battery life.Summary: This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users. It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones. It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life. Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those don’t weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars.",2020年9月6日 在美国审核
Worth the wait,"It has been a long wait, as my old Pixel continued to deteriorate, but glad that I was able to upgrade to now my favorite Android phone. The Pixel 4a is amazing, the colors are a little bit different than my old Pixel, but I know I had the same situation when I was moving from my Nexus 5x. This phone is beautiful and with multiple applications open, it's fast and smooth. I'm using the eSim with T-Mobile and that works great. I have spent a couple hours using it and really no complains, it's light, but not flimsy and my Spigen Hybrid case doesn't add much to it.",2020年8月20日 在美国审核
Not really better than a 3 year old S8?,"I was very excited about this phone. I read multiple glowing reviews. Phone arrived yesterday and I've spent several hours with it. I am coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy S8. There's nothing really wrong with that phone. It's just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone. The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active (bad for road trips).Here are some thoughts/findings about the 4a vs the S8:1. On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S82. The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode. I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a3. The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove. Gboard on S8 does not have this4. I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again5. I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a, but it still feels like I could easily drop it6. The battery life isn't that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I'd say7. Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect8. 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice (vs 64 GB on the S8), but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S89. 4a gets hot! It has complained about not being able to do a few things (transcribe for example) because it was too hotJury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not. And if it does replace it, what happens to the old phone? It's only worth $100 or less.I'd say if you were looking for a great phone for the money, and it's better that what you currently have, definitely get the 4a as it's a good price and has a lot of great features. However, carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better.",2020年8月24日 在美国审核
"So far, so good. Nice upgrade from the flagship Pixel to this new Pixel 4a","Though I've only had this Pixel 4a a few days, it has been great so far.The phone came roughly 60% charged and, as far as I can see, didn't require any security updates right away. I was able to open the box and start set-up right away without waiting for charging. The instructions for set-up were good.The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less. It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out.This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief.The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didn’t take a ton of time; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password, and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone.Also some settings needed to be readjusted.As of now, I don't seem to have lost anything, though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names. To clarify: the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text. I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn't being supported anymore and performance was getting slower.I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don't have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands. I don't use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me. I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us. I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly. Another good factor is the price of the 4a (this was significant in our decision), particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don't need or want. An additional plus is the larger screen (no bezel) while still keeping the small size of the phone. The screen looks classy and it's small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse.Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel. The plastic hardware isn't a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet-case for my phones so protection is provided &amp; people don't see the outside of the phone anyway. There are a few nice, new 'bells and whistles' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far. I'm still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double-tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out.I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting.I’m also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot (supposedly one is for editing) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos, so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time. I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon.I’m hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a.Overall, the upgrade from the flagship Pixel (or Pixel One, or whatever they call it now) appears to have been a good move.",2020年8月24日 在美国审核

Minimalist Champion,"An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions. And with the global economic challanges ahead, the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment.The form factor is ideal for me. Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens, the tradeoffs are too big IMO. The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light!The pure Android is a plus. I have had bloatware on my previous two devices (Huawei) so it is a welcome change. The option to 'pause' apps is great too.Battery is good. Easily a full day. I now have battery saver mode set to auto-enable at 75% and can get 1.5 days of moderate usage.I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization. The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more.As an aside, the P30 was a form favourite of mine, the best smartphone I had owned. Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor. It edges the 4a on performance (the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader. But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30, albeit only slightly.Anyway, I am sold on the 4a. It delivers in spades. I don't need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water. I don't need a 90+hz display (the 4a's OLED display is excellent BTW) nor do I need facial recognition. I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life.I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection.",2020年9月4日 在美国审核
Slam Dunk for the Money - and that's coming from the Pixel 3aXL,"I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone, but my wife needed a better phone, so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size.My biggest concern was the screen size difference, but with the slim bezels on the 4a, the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL. You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side, but in practical terms of use, its very neglible.As for the phone itself...I love it! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup, the fingerprint reader is still in place, it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was. While I do have very large hands, the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle, and much easier to operate one handed.Prior to my Pixel 3a XL, I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved. I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones, as well as a few other more budget friendly phones.For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk! Everything you need, nothing you don't.Full Transparency - I am not a gamer, so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming. But beyond that, it works wonderfully.If there is any downside, it is the battery. Not that it's small... I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion. However, with my slightly more than average use, I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening. The good news is that in as little as 15 mins, this thing will charge up 50% or more, so it's not a huge deal. If you are going to go out for the evening, just plug it up while you are getting ready, and you'll be more than good to go!They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone's battery life over time, so we'll see how that goes. But despite that, it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG, especially when comparing to other phones in this price point.Oh, and having just one color choice?? What does that really matter, especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone. There's a good variety of cases to add color, so don't let that stop you.",2020年9月4日 在美国审核
Why would you ever spend $900 on a phone when this exists?,"This is literally everything I could ever want or need in a phone. I do not give two craps about multiple cameras or 90hz screens. The Pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it's low price point. Double the storage than my last phone, a better camera, better screen, fantastic OS, updates for three years, free google photos storage.. and all for 50$ less than my previous phone!The camera is the selling point for me. It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones, and it's only one camera. Google's software really seriously kicks ass.The touch screen is snappy and I don't find myself wishing it was faster, it responds immediately to touch, scrolls fast and looks vibrant.The screen to body ratio is perfect, really great job removing bezels.The hole punch is not at all irritating, I've had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it. It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it. It is much better than a notch of a bezel. It looks cool I think.The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts. My last phone I only got 64gbs, because in order to get the 128gb version it was $100 more! With 128gbs and free google storage, I can't imagine needing more space ever, really.I'm really enjoying the phone, it's nice to hold even with a case, it's lightweight and pleasant to view and type on.

Dealing with a Android 11 touchscreen sensitivity bug with screen protector(issue fixed),"Their is currently a nasty bug in Android 11 that affects the Pixel 4a(Including myself).

"A bit under two weeks in, my favorite phone experience.","I got this to replace an aging Note 5, which itself was a replacement for a Nexus 5.I never quite felt like the Samsung version of android was something I enjoyed, and I was looking forward to returning to the stock experience I had with the N5, and this one fit the bill.Sure, it doesn't have a few features I was hoping it had, but the honest truth is...did I really need them?For the price ($350 at the time of this review) there simply isn't anything remotely close in my opinion, and I am truly enjoying the experience with this. The fingerprint reader is just practically instant, and the placement on the back is the right place for it. I always hated the Samsung's button fingerprint reader, and it seemed like a crap-shoot whether it would work or not. this one is just darn solid.Camera is great, and the battery life is just unbelievable.Unless you -absolutely- need some of the missing features, like the wireless charging, wide-angle camera or the faster-refresh rate, then this is the one to get. If you do feel like you need those, do make sure you ask yourself if they are worth paying over 2x the cost of this phone for them...This isn't just a great phone for $350, it is a great phone full stop, and if this is the feature set and performance I can now expect at this price point, I will never shell out $1k+ for a phone ever again.I didn't get it through amazon as it was sold out, but I also got the google branded case and that one is also fantastic and highly recommended.

Google got it right with this one. This is the Android phone to get.,"I've been a fan of the Google phone since they released the original Nexus phone over a decade ago. I've been through the good and the bad, and can confidently say that the 4a is one of the best Android phones that I've seen offered from Google.The phone has enough processing power to run the most recent Android operating systems and enough storage for my needs. The battery life is at the top of the pack for Android phones and the camera takes BEAUTIFUL pictures. USB-C charging is fast and the phone works well with third-party chargers. I've had no issues pairing it with my car or headsets and transferring over all of my data from my previous phone was a snap.One *really* nice feature of this phone is that it is dual-SIM capable; you can have both a virtual and a physical SIM.

Almost Perfect,"Edit:I traded this phone in at about the 18th month due to the lack of 5G.I camp and T-Mobile's 5G has incredible range and speed--something I discovered with the wife's 4a 5G phone.But for that I would have kept the phone the full 18 months.At this point though the phone is worth less new due to only less than 18 months of remaining security updates.The last year or so has been a concern for me because I was afraid the mid-range phone I bought three years ago would break.The new offerings have not been compelling, mainly offering better cameras but not significantly stronger processing and smaller manufacturing processes (e.g. 7nm).That has changed just in the past few months and even days as there are now at least three compelling mid-range phones.I bought the Pixel 4a because it was:(1) One of the least expensive; (2) Offers one of the best OS upgrade/update policies; and (3) Is not made in China or by a Chinese firm--pick your reason not to like China right now--there are at least four.There are things I wish it had, primarily microSD and a SD 765G processor, but the 730 is plenty fast. IMHO, we're well past the stage where most people have any real need for flagship processors (gamers excluded) I'll upgrade my wife's phone to 5G later, we would mainly need that for tethering, and we don't both need it.It will probably be the 5G version of the Pixel 4a or the Samsung 51.The packaging is fairly basic, containing the phone, a 120 volt charging block, USB-C cable and a sim tool.Also, it has a very useful adaptor from the large plug USB to USB-C.That is given to help connect to your old phone, but is also useful for Yubi security keys.The phone came roughly 60% charged and didn't require any security updates that I noticed, having Android 10 installed with security updates current to within 15 days (which makes me think I missed a security update being installed).As to the phone, it's roughly the same size as what I'm used to coming from a Moto 5G Plus, but it is slightly narrower.Overall I like the change.I have not noticed any lag, and overall the phone seems very responsive, as it should coming from a phone that is over three years old in design. I wasn't sure I'd like the fingerprint scanner on the back, but that has been fine. Setting up was a bit more difficult in that the automatic transfer process the phone tries to start apparently did not work at all, or maybe I'm just not patient enough.My old phone said ""preparing"" for over 20 minutes without any indication of progress on either phone.Setting up the old fashioned way was very quick, with my roughly 150 apps installing quickly.The only problem I've had is related to my Google Suite Account, which in the newer version of Android becomes a work account.That keeps me from signing into Google maps with that account, which I'm still trying to work around.If you don't have a paid Google Suite Account this shouldn't be an issue.I also had to change a few of the default settings, but surprisingly few.I turned off a few things to save battery life, such as monitoring for songs in the background, and turned on the virtual navigation keys at the bottom of the screen, which I prefer to their gestures system.Too early to say anything about battery life because my use of the phone has been far from normal.I'll report back if it can't get through a normal day with at least 25% of battery left.",2020年8月21日 在美国审核
Very happy camper with my new phone,"So I have had zero issues with the fingerprint reader. It is actually been really good for letting me in and nobody else in. I even put a case on mine and I can still reach the finger reader so I actually think it's really great it's much easier for me to get into my phone compared to my old one. What I like about this phone too is that it is thinner. I used to have the Moto x charge and that was definitely much wider and I didn't realize how much more uncomfortable it is. Now when I pick that one up to try and compare to this one it's such a beast in such a tank. Whereas this new phone it's thinner and slimmer and can actually like fit in my palm so it's in my hand and then it can sit nicely on my finger like if I'm holding it like cut. Which is very nice and I can reach everything on it with my thumb. The fact that the screen is the entire phone face is still giving me the exact same size as my old phone just I no longer have a big phone because it didn't take up the whole screen it had sides on it before so I really like that this one is the whole screen and that it's slimmer. I have a nice case on it and I have a screen protector on the front and I'm still able to use everything the same and everything is functioning fine. My only thing is yes the battery does last all day, my old phone my battery could last a couple days but it was an ex-charge and the battery was supposed to do that. But the bonus about this phone here is it does tell me if I keep continuing using it at the rate that I am it tells me about when my phone will die the estimated die time for the battery. So that's easy for me to be like oh okay well I'm going to be going and doing this so maybe I should charge it now. But I typically only charge it at night when I'm going to sleep. it does have a spam detection for calls which I didn't realize was a thing and I've had a couple phone calls like pop up but never ring and then they go away and I am notified that they were spam and then I have verified and they actually are indeed spam. So that has been really nice. I also like that I can give names to my group chats. Everything seems to be running very smoothly and fast at least faster than what I'm used to. it did take a little getting used to for me to do the back button cuz there was no back button I couldn't figure it out but if you just hold off to the side a little bit it is actually much easier to go back and forth between things I've found. my screen now has five icons across compared to my old one that had only four icons across so for me that's fine because I can see them fine I haven't looked to see if I can change that. So if you are maybe hard on seeing that might not be a benefit but otherwise for me since I don't have that problem this is great I really also like that I can just click on the time and date on the phone and it pulls up my calendar or the weather I don't have to go search for a different app I just click on it on my phone and it just takes me to that app.my other favorite thing is that it is still an Android phone I absolutely love the Android app I even have my tablets in Android because I'm just so used to Android and I prefer Android over the counterpart. Like I really dislike Apple and Apple I think is so much more expensive.another fun thing is the night mode I set a bedtime for me and when it's my bedtime if I'm staying up it goes into a black and white scale mode so everything is in black and white so then I go all right fine yep it's bedtime. I also like the do not disturb because I can have things blocked for when I'm sleeping so my phone isn't ringing or anything and I don't have to remember to put it on silent it was automatically does that. Unless of course it's emergency it is set to if somebody calls back within a 10-15 minute window that it will ring because it's a priority call and I have that turned on. I haven't even come close to using all the storage space that I have on my phone. Whereas my old phone I was constantly having to delete things to get a new app if I wanted to and it was very hard to do, so I like the extra space I like how fast it works and I like the thinness of it actually. As for phone calls and stuff I don't have an issue with the speaker or the earpiece very simple to use and my camera is still working nicely I I still get really nice pictures.this one does say that it's for all carriers and I have Xfinity mobile, and when I got the phone I checked the number against their oh is your phone compatible on the website and it wasn't. I was very frustrated I even set up to start a new return with this but then, I was on with the people on chat and I was trying to figure it out and I even said I was going to try and go somewhere else. But here's the thing even though that they wouldn't help me and they kind of have some sucky customer service. I have a very cheap bill with them I just have to have my cable with them to get them and then each month it's just I think it's like $12 per gigabyte of data that you use and since I don't use data I don't have a bill each month because my phone is paid off I have nothing else going on there so I have a really great deal with them so I want to keep with them so. So before I decided to actually ship it back I pulled my chip card out of my old phone and slid it into this one here and eureka! My phone actually works really well I didn't have to change anything with my carrier all I had to do was change my SIM card and the phone is compatible even if they tell you it's not compatible So I would say give that a try if you do have Xfinity, and then if it works great if not I'm sorry you'll have to look for something else considering the stage shouldn't work but mine works and I've been doing it for two months now and haven't had any disruptions with my service everything has been great and I haven't had to change my billing at all so I have really enjoyed having this phone.I hope my review has been helpful.

"Crisp, Clean, Charismatic",It really gives you that flagship experience at a pretty remarkable and competitive price point of only 349 dollars. It's a no brainer if you're looking for something more than the average $80 walmart cheapo phone. Get this phone! it very much is worth it.And personally. The lack of waterproofing for me is pointless. All my old phones where the same way. Hardly a disappointment. and no wireless charging? Eh? if it cuts off 600~ bucks off the normal 1k price tag that is something I am capable of living with.Also. 128 gb of storage means you basically never run out of space. Compared to my old phone of 12 (8 was taken up by the OS lol) it feels even better!,2020年9月24日 在美国审核
"A Great, Great Phone!","I have small hands. Most of the phones out there are big now. And I am looking for a small phone that is not premium or flagship priced. And Pixel 4a meets that need. Since there are already excellent reviews in YouTube and Amazon, I will just add my personal experience with the phone. Pixel 4a fits nicely in my hand now. I can use the phone with one hand without fumbling it. My previous phone Moto G7 while great still was a little big for my hands. I do not support iPhone ecosystem, so I was looking for Android. My wife's phone Pixel 3a was great in my hands so I thought I would check out Pixel 4a and it has bigger screen yet smaller than 3a! So I grabbed it and using it for a month, I am really satisfied. Size and weight are perfect and the performance is more than I need (I am not a gamer, so I don't need a powerful processor). The screen is OLED and is clearly better than IPS LCD screens. The colors are just more rich and pop out than IPS LCD. Battery lasts more than 1 full day (my average screen time is between 3 - 4 hours). And the camera! Wow... It is really good. I've heard it was good, but actually seeing it - I was really impressed. The ONLY thing I wish Pixel 4a had was: Water and dust proof feature (IP 68). But for $350, this phone is amazing. And you also get 3 year software update guarantee. So if you are not looking for a premium phone, but something small yet powerful and takes great pictures, then Pixel 4a is an excellent choice! Highly recommended!",2020年11月26日 在美国审核
Great midrange phone,"I'm glad to have a pure Android experience again with no carrier bloatware and no stupid system modifications from manufacturers like OnePlus. (They are the worst manufacturer in terms of needlessly killing background apps).The camera is fantastic! It's half because of the software and half because of the large pixels in the sensor. It's great in low light. The Night Sight mode is so much fun! On a tripod or some other stable surface, astrophotography mode will engage in Night Sight mode that allows for amazing star photos. The real-time HDR adjustment and preview is really nice. Basically, you tap on some portion of the photo to choose what you want the primary exposure to lock onto (like the bright part of a sunset) then a slider appears that lets you control the fill light. It's wonderful!It got the Android 11 update immediately after I bought it, so that's cool. Lots of nice little updates in that.The default gesture navigation doesn't work well with 3rd party launchers. (I use Nova Launcher). When I swipe up to go to the home screen, I can't tap any icons for 1 second. They don't respond. It's weird. But with the old school 3-button nav it works fine. Swiping up from the bottom also appears to choose the 3rd party launcher and if it were an app, then it reopens it. That might be part of that problem. Neither of these things happen with the default launcher, but that launcher wastes so much space on the clock and the search bar, so I don't like it.The CPU/GPU is plenty fast for me. I don't play much mobile gaming. Just some board games sometimes. The AI in Waterdeep takes it's turns quite a bit faster than on my old OnePlus 3T, so that's nice.Headphone jack and fingerprint reader are a huge plus for me.You get a lot of phone for the price!",2020年10月16日 在美国审核
This is a great phone!!!,I bought the Pixel 4A (Not the 4A 5G) to replace a older HTC model which is no longer being updated. Before buying it I looked at other phones and found that most didn't get regular OS or Security updates or if they did it was months after the update became available which makes me nervous. When looking at a lot of the other phones I found that most came with built in apps that quite frankly I would never use and more often than not you couldn't un install which I don't like one bit. The Pixel 4A came with a lot of google apps (Most of which can be uninstalled which is a breath of fresh air) and the apps that can't be uninstalled like Google assistant (Which is part of the OS) can be completely turned off unlike some other assistant apps from other companies which really helps preserve my privacy. I am extremely pleased and pleasantly surprised with the ability to turn things off or uninstall the apps I don't want. Unlike many people I don't use my phone a lot so I only have to charge it twice a week so batterie life is great!The phone has worked perfectly since I got it and Over all I am extremely pleased with the purchase!! I would definitely reccomend this phone to anyone!,2020年11月25日 在美国审核
Awesome phone all around.,"I love this phone! My old phone was slow and froze frequently within the first few months of having it, but the Pixel 4a has none of those problems!The camera is amazing, and has a lot of great settings and options. I will attach a regular picture and a portrait mode picture to show the clarity and great quality. The camera is also quickly accessable by double tapping the lock button on the side of the phone.I noticed that Google Duo has a share screen feature that is available on the Pixel 4a, but not a lot of other phones, and I enjoy having that option.The fingerprint reader works great.The battery lasts a very long time. I use my phone very frequently and usually charge it to 70 or 80% to preserve battery life. Even with all the usage, I usually only have to charge it once a day. It would definitely take a while to die with a full charge so no worries there.The thing I came across the most while researching the phone prior to purchasing was ""it's a great budget phone"" and I 100% agree. I'm no tech expert, but as a regular user, I can say this is the best phone I have ever had.In comparison with the Pixel 4 (which I do not have), the Pixel 4a does have a headphone jack, but does not have wireless charging or the squeeze feature, and is not water-resistant.I have the phone in ""Just Black"" and it is very nice and sleek with a white lock button.There were originally no navigation buttons and the phone directed me to use gestures but I was able to get the navigation buttons that I prefer in the settings.Overall it's a great phone and I highly recommend it.",2020年10月14日 在美国审核
A full-featured casual phone,"I have been a Motorola phone fan for quite a while. The Moto X, G, and Z series are all stellar phones. I switched, though, and here's why:- Rear Fingerprint Sensor. I've gotten comfortable with this on my last Moto so I kept it.-Prox / RF reader. I can tap to pay with this phone as if I had my card. This means I don't need my wallet at a gas station!-Headphone Jack. This is on the Motos too, but it's an absolute NECESSITY for me and my dozens of headphones.-Google support, it's seamlessly working with my computer and my Google accounts.-HUGE internal storage. 128Gb is nice and it's all internal, so no app slowdown. The lack of an SD card hurts, but I haven't needed it yet, and it's been months.It's also completely smooth. It charges fast. It's perfectly sized for me. And the screen is noticable ""prettier"" than my Motos.I say if you're not sure about this phone, let this be the confirmation that you won't be disappointed unless you need a gaming phone.",2021年6月4日 在美国审核
Great buy and value when upgrading from Pixel XL and I think when just wanting a great phone.,"I have the original Pixel XL and almost upgraded to the 3a XL last year, but the reviews didn't convince me it was worth it.I just kept using my phone until I found what I thought would be a nice upgrade.The 4a is the right phone for me at the right time.The cost was so tempting given the specs, I didn't blink.I got it from Amazon only 3 days after official release.I love it.Nothing about it feels inferior to the Pixel XL.I was able to connect a USB-C cable and transfer my files and settings in about 20 minutes.I also connected to my main Win 10 machine and updated my music on the new phone and everything went without a hitch.I found this upgrade process so much easier and smoother than when I upgraded the two family I-phones (6+ and 7+ to 11) Christmas 2019.Once I set everything up I checked performance and found the new 4a very snappy.My use is mostly web browsing, email. news, a bit of shopping and Facebook.Nothing challenging, so I loaded up YouTube TV and watched it in small and full screen while I transferred some of the music files.I saw no slow downs in playback or the transfer.From my limited testing around the home office, the camera is pretty nice.The speakers are about on par with the original Pixel and about what I expected.The speakers sound fine. With a headphone jack and Bluetooth 5.0, better sound is simple enough to remedy. I know this isn't in depth or a long term review, but in the 24 hours I have had this phone its been great.I have gotten good battery life too.Thanks Google for a great phone and Amazon for getting it to me.",2020年8月24日 在美国审核
Fantastic phone with no downside,"I've used this phone for a full day. The cameras are fantastic, the display is good (but small for my taste). Haven't used the battery too much (+ the google battery AI hasn't been trained yet), so can't judge on that. The extra RAM here is great -- I went through my social media, then went back to a heavy game (GTA SA) and it was surprisingly still in memory! I've noticed the phone gets really hot throughout the day, especially when you're charging and using it for video calls. The phone even said that it would start disabling features due to overheating. So maybe avoid charging the phone and using it. That's the only bummer I've had with this phone -- that aside, this is a fantastic budget phone.",2020年8月25日 在美国审核
Absolutely solid phone!,"So I was slightly skeptical about this phone. Some of the reviews worried me a bit. I did a month worth of research on finding the perfect budget phone for myself. Everything was pointing to the pixel 4a. I unfortunately didn't do enough research with my last phone which was the moto g7. I absolutely loved the g5 and just assumed I would love that one as well, and no I didn't. So this was like a really nice upgrade for me. I usually use a phone for at least 2 years and couldn't get past a year with that one. So I'm a heavy phone user from streaming, games here and there, camera and social media. I'm not some tech genius but I do my research. Let me tell you some things I love about this phone.Standout Pros-- The price!-The camera, it's absolutely fantastic. I can't get over how much I love it. My photos on my old phone were terrible. Now I can't stop taking pics.- Minimal bloatware. Not a whole lot is preloaded onto this phone which is great.- How light it is. Old phone was so heavy my hand would fall asleep. This is a great weight.-The features, I love some of the great things this phone can do. Such as the picking up of music around you. There are a bunch of things I really enjoy but just go watch a good review on youtube if you want to see them all.Cons--Extremely crappy case selection lol. Literally that's the only con I have so far and it's a small one.Although I do have to say that everyone was raving about the pixel 4a's battery life. And I have to say it's pretty good. It's about the same as my old phone. It's not insane as I thought it was going to be. It's not a con because it's not bad in any way. Just thought I would mention it's not as mind blowing as it was made out to be. Also I thought I'd mention that my old phone had a 6.2 inch screen and this is obviously smaller. I don't even miss or notice the smaller screen. I was a little hesitant on the smaller screen of the pixel. But almost immediately I didn't even notice the difference. I actually enjoy having a slightly smaller phone.The shipping was great from this seller as well.These were just a few Standout things from an average person like me. I use my phone for absolutely everything and a quality phone is extremely important. I look forward to using this phone for 2+ years at least. I hope some of this helps anyone on the fence!",2020年12月28日 在美国审核
"Excellent phone, over the moon happy with it","I have always had expensive iPhones (over $1 K), but now that I am retired I cannot afford that kind of money for a phone. I am also totally SICK of Apple, as their security on phones and iCloud is so extreme and bizarre that I have wasted many hours on their help line. Did you know that if Apple mistakingly thinks you are in Hong Kong, they will change your entire phone to traditional Chinese? That took me 5 hours on the phone to rectify. And puzzles me ... even if I WAS suddenly in Hong Kong, I would NOT suddenly start reading and speaking in traditional Chinese. In any event, I could not take the stress any more, so I decided to take the BIG step of divorcing Apple and moving to Android. I expected to have a big learning curve, but I just watched a few YouTube videos, and the transition was seamless. Within 24 hours I was IN LOVE with this phone. The screen is gorgeous, the speed is more than good enough, the battery life is awesome, and the apps are marvelous. It can do EVERYTHING my iPhones used to do. The difference is that downloading my photos to my computer is easy and a sheer pleasure. I NEVER get locked out because, for example, I have travelled to Mexico and suddenly Apple is suspicious of me. Oh, and the camera is super important to me. That is why, after a lot of research, I chose this particular phone. Well, the camera is outstandingly excellent. I am thrilled about the astral photography. For a third of the price I paid for my iPhone 6, I now have a camera that is about 3x better. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone - the best one I have ever had in my life. And this is coming from someone who has had decades of flagship phones from Apple. I feel sorry for all those who still think that nothing but an iPhone would do. I would rather go back to pay phones than ever own an iPhone again.",2020年12月10日 在美国审核
Lightning fast phone,"I can't even begin to say how much I love this phone. Replaced a Moto G6. Have been a long time Moto phone user, but was disappointed in the G6 and the reviews for the newest model didn't look good, so decided it was time to move to another brand. Couldn't be happier with the Pixel 4A.It was easy to setup and transfer my apps and files with the included cord that plugged into my old phone. Inserted my old verizon sim card and I was in business in minutes.I was most excited to check out the camera, which was highly rated. Very pleased with the pictures so far. The details and colors on close up shots of flowers really pop. Excited to see more on my trip to Glacier later this summer.Some reviews say battery life isn't great, but that has not been my experience. Generally have had around 75 percent left at the end of the day.

The phone you are looking for,"I originally had a Pixel 3a for a year but decided to sell it in May 2020 to try something else. I went to a Xiaomi Note 9 Pro, Samsung S20 FE, Realme 6 Pro, Samsung S20 FE again, and now the Pixel 4a. I could have avoided all of those phones if I just stuck with Pixel. The instant security and OS updates, compact form factor, ease of flashing custom ROMs and reverting back to stock with Google's online tool, excellent battery life, and bloat free, fast software experience are what make Pixel the best. I commonly get 6.5hrs screen on time with auto brightness and light theme on. Although I really enjoyed the Xiaomi and Realme, they do not support VoLTE and WiFi calling in the US with US carriers. Samsung even though they have the best hardware, OneUI is by far my least favorite Android skin. I was GLAD to lose the superior screen, speakers, 5G, 120Hz, and WiFi 6 on the S20 FE to go to the lesser Pixel because the software experience is just that much faster and better. I forgot how much faster and more accurate physical fingerprint readers were compared to the in screen ones. Pixel 4a is definitely the phone you should go for. In my experience, 5G in my area is really not better, if not worse than 4G LTE especially since the 5G in my area is low band non stand alone. The 5G speeds were the same as 4G and I experienced higher latency in certain areas. For this reason I'd choose the 4a over the 4a 5G unless you want the bigger screen. The 4a should have been $299 to compete more with the OnePlus Nord N10 but the extra $50 is well worth it for the longer software support Pixel provides. Overall an excellent phone and I HIGHLY recommend it after having used most major phone brands within a short period of time.",2021年2月24日 在美国审核
Love this phone! Will always go with Google!,"This phone for one thing has an awesome camera which I use for everything. I was getting so used to not getting clear sharp or correctly exposed photos with the Moto I had before. I struggled to get a clear closeup or sometimes even distant photos with the Moto. With this phone I am amazed, I get nicely exposed and clear pictures in all light levels. I use my phone to document items and even documents using the photo scan app and it works perfectly. I couldn’t have done that with Moto it just wouldn’t happen the camera and app on Motorola is horrible and I got no help from Motorola at all it’s a defect numerous people have. With this camera I have none of that the pics are just crystal clear and I don’t have to stand on my head and pray just for a good pic. Thanks Google. I like google everything it just works! Thank you! I can get perfect pictures for my reviews on Google maps and Amazon etc. I couldn’t do that before! The camera is important to me because I don’t carry my big digital camera anymore it’s just to much hassle. I want a nice clear picture taking camera that’s easy to use and quick! I use the camera more than phone calls and text so I really love this phone! I find that the camera functions can do very extensive things and for once they are easy to use which I didn’t have before. Google please keep it up make a camera that is good and easy to use and just works! I haven’t commented on the actual phone functions as I just live for the camera! I use it to document my old pictures and convert them to digital and store them on Google Photos, love it. I’ve done the old way trying to store on a desktop computer on hard drives, discs and flash drives and a scanner. Not anymore I had to re digitize my old paper pictures to google and I can access them effortlessly using Google Photos. I’m sold, I use Google for everything now. I’m 65 and this digital apps, camera phone and Google pics is just so much easier to do. The camera itself works excellent and menus are so much better and easier to use.

Great phone.,"Highly recommended. Easy to use, great battery life, great camera, up-to-date and clean version of Android without the usual manufacturer bloatware. One downside is that it doesn't have an SD card slot, but I'm finding the 128gb builtin storage is more than enough for now. I bought this as a replacement for a Motorola Moto Z2 Play phone after the front glass started to separate from the frame. The Motorola was a little bigger than the Pixel 4a (and a little unwieldy if the truth be told)but to my mind the smaller size of the Pixel 4a makes it easy to handle, certainly one-handed. Though smaller in overall size the whole-screen display of the Pixel 4a seems to be about the same size as that of the Motorola and I find it runs a bit faster than the Motorola too. Overall very pleased with the new phone .",2021年5月28日 在美国审核
Finally there's a phone for grownups!,"[May 7, 2021 thoughts on Pixel 4a, ordered November 8, 2020 and used daily ever since]PROS:Form factor and weight-This is the best marriage I have found. Fantastic screen real estate, sensible (ideal?) resolution, and just terrific dimensions for me. This thing is light weight for its size, and I love that more than I can possibly express. Hand fatigue has been all but completely eliminated. Give me plastics, baby! I have no desire for metals that don't add to functionality (and apparently, from something I saw on YouTube, this phone is insanely rugged, even with a plastic shell). Glass is always heavier and less durable than other materials choices, and it's just altogether not well suited for the backside of a mobile handset, IMO. I think Apple charges $550 to replace the back glass on most modern iPhones. This Pixel 4a is the total package and stickers for $200 less than the price of Apple's back glass repair.Price:Performance-While I can't compare this phone to another of its kind with a higher performing Qualcomm, I am never wanting for speed. This phone has been wonderfully fluid and performant for my day-to-day needs. The lean Android experience on the Pixel line really lets its mid-range Qualcomm shine. I most recently carried both an iPhone 7 Plus and 2020 SE, and both proved plenty fast for anything I do; this 4a is no exception.Background app refreshes seem to be on par with what I had using 3GB iPhones. No real surprises. My day-to-day habits seem mostly unaffected by any background app refreshes I've noticed. I think the 6GB of memory strikes a good balance for the 4a.I don't game. Well, I play some chess now and again, including occasional analysis using very demanding engines (Stockfish, etc), but in general I can't comment on gaming performance.Battery-Battery life and charging time have been lovely. I seldom charge to 100-percent, instead I prefer to just give little 5- to 15-minute charges periodically during the day, while keeping the battery in the 30- to 70-percent range where possible. This thing charges way, way faster than my older 7 Plus and 2020 SE iPhones and overall battery life is likely comparable or better from what I can gather (very unscientifically). I leave it to the readers to determine how important battery life is and do some research of their own.Camera-It's so good it doesn't even make sense. Shooting stills, the 4a smashes my old iPhone 7 Plus my a wide margin and the 2020 SE couldn't hold a candle either. I think that's being objective. I've had quite a bit of low-level, professional photography training at University level and time behind the lens of DSLRs, and I'm quite astonishing that I can get such quality images from the 4a. The software image processing is pure magic.I have kids, and they're the important subjects for me. I'd guessed the 4a might struggle with motion, particularly in lower light, which would have been a deal-breaker for me, but this thing takes ""keepers"" practically every single time. Glorious. Most already know how well Pixel phones shoot non-moving subjects, so I won't carry on about that. It's an exciting camera experience. Concerning video, the 1080p 30- and 60-frame shooting has not disappointed either, and the image stabilization is truly excellent. I don't mess with 4k on phones (yet), so no comment there. I don't take selfies, so I won't comment on the front-facing camera either.Android-The gesture navigation is fantastic, particularly the ability to go back by swiping in from either the left- or right-hand side of the display. Massively convenient and easy on the hands.Updates/security patches are crucial for me, and with a Pixel, scorching fast updates are what you get, and support duration bests most Android-based OEMs.Fingerprint recognition-Works as well and as fast as any I've experienced. Thought the rear placement would bug me. It absolutely does not. Rear placement is probably my preference now. Well executed. I like.CONS:Audio volume/intensity-The 4a just doesn't get as loud as some other modern handsets. It's tricky to listen to a podcast or whatever when I'm doing dishes, for example. That said, the audio quality is perfectly satisfactory, to me.Google Search-There's a Google search bar installed by default on the home screen. I leave mine there and find it useful. When tapped, you're presented with the ability to ""search apps, web, and more..."" (much like the search on iOS when you pull down from the top). Google/Android learns over time, so that eventually it can quickly present you with what you're most likely to want. Works great, more often than not. But the problem for me is that it's inconsistent with regards to displaying apps. It must be that about 20-percent of the time it doesn't display apps, so I'm forced to swipe up from the bottom of the display to close the interface, then tap the Google search bar again before it populates apps in the query. I can't figure out what causes this for the life of me, and I've owned an IT MSP for years, so this ain't my first rodeo with tech devices! Frustrating, but muscle memory makes this only a half-second affair to correct.Dependability-I've long used the same MVNO for cell service, which I mention only because there exists a small possibility that it's of importance here: I've found a few occasions where I can't place phone calls. To fix, for some reason, a reboot was required. I haven't had any issues in the past few months, but it's probably because I've changed habits; now, whenever there's an update to something low-level from Android (not just a basic app update), I reboot the phone. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?? Anyway, I'd have a ""need"" to reboot an iPhone maybe once every six months, outside of forced reboots from doing an iOS update. To have had to monthly (or maybe even more frequently) reboot this 4a in order to connect phone calls (with no warning as to any trouble, unless I attempted to place a call and ""connect the dots"") is unfortunate. I don't like to have to think about mitigating critically buggy behavior by rebooting my phone from time to time.OLED-I'm sensitive to flicker, so I basically hate OLED. My daily driver laptop is a ThinkPad T480s LARGELY because its 1080p IPS is flicker-free (no PWM). This 4a gives me viewing fatigue after a relatively short while. On the 4a, unless you're at max brightness (exactly 100-percent), you can expect flicker in the ~122 to 255Hz range. That's too low for me. I would prefer an LCD, like the ones I had in my iPhone 7 Plus or 2020 SE. I could view those endlessly without fatigue- read books on them, you name it. But the industry does trend, and trend it does for the contrast ratio specs and inky blacks the kids rave about these days {rolls eyes}.Overall:This is probably the finest overall set of compromises I've ever found in a cell phone, and I've owned many of them since 1994. I'm highly satisfied with this handset, and I think very little could realistically be done today to improve upon the formula that is the Pixel 4a. Google has made a proper phone for adults.9/10 DO recommend!",2021年5月7日 在美国审核
Doesn't deserve anything below 4 stars,"This phone is amazing. As someone who was in need of an upgrade on the android side of cell phones, I went with this phone simply because of the various positive reviews a saw of it on YouTube. I for one wanted a good camera on my phone and this device meets my need. Although video can be better, it is still usable. The still photos are awesome, no complaints there! It's an easy to use phone with good battery life and smooth performance. In my opinion, you are getting more for what you pay for.

"Excellent phone, not just a budget phone","I got this to replace my aging Galaxy S7 and I have not been disappointed.

"I love this phone, much prefer it to the Pixel 4","I love this phone. Please keep in mind, I've never owned a flagship phone, usually sticking to phones I could buy outright for less than $200.That said, I was ready for a new phone and did a lot of research. I also had a chance to spend some time with a Pixel 4 to compare it. So the following are my impressions:First off, what's different from the Pixel 4: You are missing the aluminum frame, the facial recognition, the edge squeeze, the water resistance, a specific camera lens and some camera features, wireless charging, and an 800 series processor. I think that's about it.The thing is, other than the water resistance, I personally don't miss any of that.What you get in return is a slightly bigger screen, a better battery, and a brighter screen (you have to use adaptive brightness for it to work). This is also a fair bit lighter. Also a personal preference is that I prefer the fingerprint reader over facial recognition.For me it's the perfect little phone. Full disclosure, I paid about $260 since I bought it from Amazon Warehouse. Nonetheless, this phone hits all the right spots for me. It is light, it has a clear and bright screen, it is fast, takes amazing pictures, it isn't bloated with preinstalled apps, and is future proof in that you can update for 3 years, the sound is pretty great, and honestly I can't find much to complain about.The only thing I wish this had was the water resistance. Accidents happen. Also keep in mind that this is plastic with an outdated Guerilla 3 screen. Buy a case. Buy a screen protector. If you do, I can't see why this phone won't be a great phone for you unless you only buy the $1000 flagships with all the bells and whistles, in which case, why are you even reading this review?One last thought. The battery is fine by me. I can make it through the day and longer with moderate use. No wireless charging, but it charges from zero to full in pretty much less than an hour, so I always find time within the day to plug it in and then I'm good to go. Usually at dinner time or whatever when I don't want to be disturbed anyway.Had a chance to to go with the Pixel 4, chose to go with this instead (mostly because the Pixel 4 screen is waaaaay to dim). Thanks Google for this amazing cheap phone!",2021年2月13日 在美国审核
For this price it's hard to be disappointed,"I really like what Google is doing for the midrange consumers like myself.Coming from a Pixel 2 I was a bit let down about the performance downgrade, despite better battery life.After some time using the phone I haven't noticed much lag aside from the camera's render time.It takes 5-10 seconds to fully render a new picture which is pretty significant delay.My images look horrible during the render process and there's no eta shown, just have to keep opening it.Images look really great after the render is complete but the lack of a timer or indicator of rendering is off-putting.Speakers also sounded significantly better on the pixel 2 but at least I can still hear the 4a's speakers.All other apps run smoothly and my battery life and recharge rate has made this a pleasure to use as a delivery driver with maps open 100% of the time.There are better options out there for battery life, but with much compromise in other areas.As a former Verizon wireless sales associate and tech nerd I highly recommend this phone if your budget is below $500, at the time of this review.There are some minor shortcomings of the device but overall I think the sacrifices made to make the phone only $350 are perfect.",2021年6月26日 在美国审核
"Excellent, affordable, and no longer in use. A cautionary tale of ecosystem switching.","I purchased my Pixel 4a for a couple of reasons. My iPhone 7 Plus was getting a little long in the tooth and I'd been considering an upgrade but even as an iPhone user since the original one, I'd become a bit turned off by ever increasing pricing on Apple's phones. Also, as a product of the Walkman generation I really missed having a headphone jack. Fast forward four months and I'm using an iPhone 12 Pro Max.. what went wrong?Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The Pixel 4a is a really great phone. Nice form factor, always on display, fast and responsive fingerprint reader, a headphone jack and frequent updates to its operating system. My only real misgiving is the lack of wireless charging, which is quickly becoming essential to me. This is a great phone that you can customize to your heart's content, and if you're not entrenched in Apple's ecosystem you can probably go ahead and purchase without any reservations. I say 'probably', because I felt very ready to pick up and move away from Apple's ecosystem, however your circle of friend, family and co-workers should be taken into account. What do the people in your life use? If it's primarily iPhone, that may provide some friction to your transition over to Android. In my case I found that not being connected to iMessage and Facetime was enough of an inconvenience that I was using my iPod Touch to replace the features I no longer had access to on my phone. Silly, right? That was my conclusion, and I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro Max.Do I LIKE one more than the other? I suppose the iPhone 12 does feel a bit more premium, due largely to the fact that it is... I don't think it's a question of 'like', though. Your phone is more a question of fit for your life, and as positively as I felt about the Pixel 4a, the fit wasn't quite right. Things may be different for you, but I can stand behind the Pixel 4a as a quality phone and a bargain at its list price.",2021年3月26日 在美国审核
A slightly more than enough phone for everyday tasks for a reasonable price.,"I was using the Pixel 3 previously. Processing power-wise it was a down grade but bought this phone because my pixel 3 was starting to stutter at times and I just loved the way the display on the Pixel 4a looked. After receiving the phone- the phone felt really nice on the hands: outer plastic shell didn't feel cheap nor plasticky as many youtube reviewers stated(feels solid to me atleast). Also the curvature of the side well complimented the gesture navigation(going back gesture).- full display mode on youtube is awesome as expected(the bottom left punch hole is rarely noticeable due to its position in horizontal mode). Although the space between the top edge of the display and the status bar is quite noticable and would've been better if the gap was shorter.- also the display brightness seems slightly lower than the pixel 3 but nothing serious.- haptics feels identical to the Pixel 3 and happy that google did not cheap on this part.- apps not supporting the display ratio/size has a slim cutoff on the bottom of the display. Also, the status bar part is unutilised on all apps, which is a bummer but again not critical.- photo takes a split second more to process/save right after taking one, but besides this occasion I don't feel any noticeable processing speed difference on daily tasks compared to the Pixel 3(probably gaming will feel materially different but personally I don't game with my phone so no complaints on processing power).Overall, really enjoying the display and the design.",2020年9月9日 在美国审核
The phone I've been waiting for,"While I work in the space of mobile applications I tend to hold off on upgrading my phone until the last minute of my phone's life. Upgrading to this from the OG Pixel was a great transition. There were things about the other Pixel phones that I didn't like so I waited until one had what I needed. Headphone jack, thank goodness. I'm old and still love having this as an option because I have older equipment here and there that it's just a lot easier. Fingerprint reader on the back of the phone again; this is one thing that the OG Pixel had that I really loved. It became second nature so I really wanted it back. The battery life on this phone is fantastic so far. I would say with moderate use I could probably get 2 days out of it on a charge. It also charges fairly quickly. For performance, it does exceptionally well for theprice range and it's all I need. The camera takes pretty great pictures, and does well with portrait mode even better than the iPhone SE. (It recognizes my dog so I'm happy haha). The only downsides to this phone for me would be no wireless charging and it is not 5G ready. I knew this going into it and honestly I can't live without those things for another couple of iterations. The phone is very intuitive and a great experience.",2020年9月8日 在美国审核
No User Manual,"No user manual, not in the box, not online.It seems the only available information is on Google's Pixel Phone Help web page and on the phone itself.Both assume I know enough about what I don't know to search for it.According to one post, the rationale for limiting user information to online help is the rapid pace of change.That's what versioning is for:new release, new version of the manual.It's no more difficult than updating online help.Both formats are useful; each serves a different purpose.I may be wrong, but I suspect the company's refusal to produce a user manual is evidence of the disdain with which Google engineers view their user community.The attitude is not uncommon among software developers.I know whereof I speak; I am a software developer, though not for Google.And, yes, I returned the phone.",2020年10月12日 在美国审核
Why Drive A Pinto When You Can Drive A Cadillac,"This was quite a step up for me going from a HTC Desire 526 smart phone to the Google Pixel 4a smartphone. I like the fact that it is unlocked. Never buy a phone that is not. In that way you can take it to the carrier of your choice. I've been with Verizon for 4 years now. And they keep giving me perks for my loyalty so you never bite the hand that feeds you. Now about the phone itself. I like the fact it had a transfer device with it so transferring my files, pics, and contacts was very easy for me and granted I am not real techie but I can do a few things without help. I like the fact it has 128gb of internal memory so no need for an internal micro sd card. Great camera too. I like you can set it to block out telemarketers. It takes very little time to charge it and the charge lasts a very long time. 12 hours approximately depending on what you do with your phone. I am NOT a gamer as I view it as a big waste of time. The phone has limitless potentials. I like the OLED screen too. It's very light and thin which is nice. I do suggest you get a good rubber armor for it which I did. People I talk to ask me what kind of phone I am on now because I sound really good on it. You won't experience drop calls on this phone no matter where you are. I'm 68 years young and hope this will be the last phone I will ever own until the day they put me in a box.It has a great assortment of ringer sounds to choose from or if you don't want to be disturbed you can set it to that too. Great Wi-Fi too and you can turn it into your own private Wi-Fi hotspot if you choose to do so. Which I think is very cool. I don't think you can go wrong with this phone as like I said before the potentials of what it can do seem to be limitless. Also the learning curve is quite easy and it's an Android. Iphones are just a name and you pay dearly for it. I'll stick to Android phones. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a very functional and efficient/proficient phone.Buy it. You won't regret it.",2020年12月4日 在美国审核
"Best value for money, would paid more for it.","I have used oneplus 7t pro, pixel 4 Xl, IPhone 11 pro, S20 and finally pixel 4a in that order for the past year. After using the pixel 4a for 2 days, I can easily say this is my favorite phone of the bunch. Very happy with the placement and speed of the fingerprint reader as opposed to the not so accurate one on the one plus and s20 on screen fingerprint. Very happy with the battery life, as opposed to the crappy battery on the S20 with exynos chip. My favorite camera to take photos, just like the pixel 4. Best software experience, same as the pixel 4, and finally it costs 350 dollars, which is only half the price of the least expensive phone on the list!!!! This is by far the best value for money I have ever seen in a phone. Biggest downside was the 60 hz refresh rate after coming from the 120 hz in the S20, but I can't really complain given this is marketed as a ""budget phone"".

Works so far,"I went from a Galaxy S7 to this Pixel 4A 5 days ago. So far I like it. It is very similar to the S7 in overall size, but without the bezels the screen is bigger. Most functions seem similar, I'm not sure what the raves about a ""pure Android experience"" are about. I don't trust and don't use either the facial recognition or fingerprint reader, so I just gave them a middle star rating. The speakers are loud enough for me and I have a some age related hearing deficit. I've always used an ATT store to set up my phones before, but they told me they no longer do that for unlocked phones, despite paying upfront for their network for the past 8 years. I followed Google's online instructions for transferring the data from my S7 and they worked fine. The only irritating thing was that the directions said the box contained an adapter for attaching a USB C cable to a USB micro; it doesn't. It is an adapter for connecting a full size USB to the USB C in the box. So I had to go get a full size USB to USB Micro cable. Overall, I can't see a lot of difference between this phone and my previous S7, except that I now get security updates for Android and the S7 no longer does. Why pay $700+ for a ""flagship phone"" when this does the job for half the price or much less? And 5G? Give me a break. Lots of hype and no benefits so far. I don't expect to see a benefit in my rural area for many years and it still doesn't work any better than 4G LTE in downtown Denver where my wife's office is.

Surprisingly good phone,"For 3 years I had been waiting for Motorola to come out with a suitable replacement for my old, cracked screen Moto G5 Plus. I waited in vain.All that were available in the US were gimmicky phones like the stylus. And they got ever larger too.The Pixel 4a is just right.It fits comfortably in my hand.It's feels lighter than my Moto. The on/off button is located high on the right side where it is out of the way -- I don't press it every time I pick up the phone. The fingerprint reader is located on the back where it can be operated one-handed, also out of the way so it is not triggered every time I touch the bottom of the screen. There is only an occasional problem with fingerprint recognition, not enough to complain about.I think they got the basic ergonomics right.The phone screen itself is bright enough to see outside. The calls are clear and volume is good. The screen is sharp.I have no problems getting a couple days regular usage from the battery.

An absolute winner,"This not going be a technical review for this phone. Rather it's just my impressions about owning it.This phone is fantastic. I get two and a half days out of the battery but I also don't live on my phone. One of the great things is no bloatware, what a nice change. This phone basically set itself up, a bit of a letdown for someone who enjoys ""tinkering"" with things. I do like the fingerprint reader. If it will work on my fingers, it should work for anyone. Great camera, a first for me, settings I expect to find on my SLR not a phone. I really haven't got to try it but I will try to report what I think later on.

Fits well in one hand for single-handed use while still fitting in a pocket.There's probably nothing better in the price range if you need CDMA and GSM ability in one phone.I transferred all settings,contacts ,messages and phone number with the provided cable and was able to use my old sim with no issues. No hassle.I don't understand why this is often compared to flagship phones in the $600 up range -it's not.Google makes others beside the Pixel 4aif you need 5G or some trendy features.If you are upgrading from a cheaper,outdated OS LG,Samsung,Motorola phone this is a clear winner.Two or three times the ram and most likely double the storageof your old phone.It does have a plastic back,but it's very sturdy without flex and better made than my LG and previous Samsung that will never offer system updates.. The Pixel 4a came with Android 10 and has already updated to 11.Display is good , even in sunlight where cheap phones may not be.The speakers do not rival $800 phones, but they are very good soundingcompared to$100-250 phones;much better than the rear firing speakers I was used too. Bluetooth and wireless signal and sound quality are strong as well,with better speed on wireless..Thesingle lens camera is great for low light and sharp images in .raw or standard .jpeg like most folks use - far superior color, sharpness, and exposure than other phones also rated at 12 MP- but note that you can't adjust the shutter speed or f stop like a S20FE or S10 - but I really don't need three lenses ,I have a dslr for that.There's an 8mp front camera that performswell too.There's no SD card slot,and I initially thought that was a minus since I use a 64GB SD for music.But I don't have any problems with the128GB. You can swap or copy files to/from a PC or tablet with a 3.0 USBA to usb C cable like any phone; perhaps slower depending on your PC or tablet USB ratings.",2020年12月14日 在美国审核

Probably the best phone for the money,"I didn't need to buy this phone. But it was so cheap that I bought one just to play with a modern Pixel phone.For the money, this is probably the best phone you can buy, especially on the Android side, and especially if you love that ""pure Android"" factor.Yes, Pixels aren't ""pure Android"", but close enough in a post-Nexus world.And the Pixel-specific features are outstanding.Even though the camera isn't the top-tier hardware we'd expect from flagships, Google's computational photography is unrivaled.Compared to my iPhone 11 and older Galaxy S8+, the Pixel 4a absolutely is at least as good, if not better.I bought this phone, however, to test the video capabilities.No surprise, it's not as good as the iPhone 11.But again, for the money, it's really good.Filmic Pro will overheat the phone when shooting in high resolutions and frame rates, but that's expected on Android anyway.The biggest downside for this phone is the screen--it's definitely not bright enough, but it still looks good.The fingerprint reader is blazing fast, and despite being a much lower power processor in this phone it still holds up quite well to most use cases.Honestly, if you want a Pixel without paying nearly flagship prices, this should be your pick.",2020年11月16日 在美国审核
Perfect for me!,"I was extremely torn between this phone and the Moto G Power (2020 version). They are both great phones without bloatware, and top of their relative classes, but I'm very happy I paid more for the Pixel 4a. It's smaller, lighter, way better camera, better hardware, more software/security updates, and I prefer Google apps anyway. It has more features than I'll use, but not a ridiculous amount like on the Samsung Galaxy S4 I had years ago. I was nervous about battery life, just because I'm used to having a phone with a ridiculous battery, but there are so many settings that extend your battery life on this phone. There's a battery saver mode AND an extreme battery saver mode! I want this phone to last as many years as possible, so I use the extreme mode all the time time. I don't have to charge it but once every 1-3 days. If I used the phone more I would probably have to charge it once a day. I like I can unpause specific apps, while leaving the rest in battery save mode.I was nervous about buying a used (not renewed) phone on Amazon, especially because the one I purchased was only considered in ""good condition, with minor scratches on front, back, and sides"". The phone I received is nearly flawless! I actually didn't notice the incredibly minute scratches on the left side, and bottom right corner of the screen for at least 30 minutes out of the box. They're so small I thought they were dust. There are no marks on the back or sides at all. I couldn't be happier with this phone and I'm so glad I saved some money buying it used. I can't speak for longevity, but my bank gives me a 2yr warranty past a phone's release date, and the Pixel only came out Aug 2020. Seriously get this phone if you like smaller phones, if you need a cheaper phone, I would get the Moto G Power(2020 version only!) in a heartbeat.",2021年3月30日 在美国审核

Great value for the money,"While this isn't the highest end phone on the market, it has really great features, a very decent processor, and unexpectedly long battery life for the size.The battery life may be benefiting from the smaller OLED screen.The finger print sensor works consistently and is easy to reach.This phone is chalk full of the latest Google features. Granted some of them are gimmicks, but you'll be able to impress your friends with a 350USD phone.The camera is probably the pixel 4as biggest selling point. The funny thing is it isn't really the camera itself that makes it good. It's all the software that allows 1 camera to emulate the functions of a lot of 4-camera phones. And this emulsion is pretty good.For instance, the portrait mode is able to give that depth is field effect without a depth sensor.I didn't even buy this phone for the camera, so I like the fact that I'm not paying for 6 cameras but I'm still getting the same functions.",2021年1月6日 在美国审核
Perfection is the enemy of good.,"Google Pixel 4a is a good phone in every sense of the word ""good."" Everything works very well for the right price. No junk apps and no Big Brother who sends your data to the FBI behind your back. 100% pure Google experience as everyone should expect. I wouldn't pay more for bells and whistles that don't matter. The phone comes with a Quick Switch Adapter that worked with old phone cables that transferred all my settings and apps over in 2 min. It also automatically updates itself to the latest Android 11 OS August security update and will always keep itself up-to-date and secure. It works with Oracle EMM work profile. The phone builds in the Google ""Hold for Me"" feature so that Google listens to the obnoxious ""elevator"" music on your behalf while you are put on hold.

"Great, fast, compact phone with regular updates","The Pixel 4a is the best phone I've ever owned. It's performance is very good, the size is great in my hand, and the camera is really good. Even though it's only maybe 1cm smaller than other phones it really fits in the hand much better. The plain Android software works well, and it gets regular software updates. Other than that it's much the same as any other Android phone.Battery life is pretty good, not as good as phones with larger batteries but you do have to compromise a little when you choose a small phone - there's not much space for the battery in there. I charge my battery to 80% and most days with light use it's at about 40 - 50% at the end of the day. If I use it really heavily it would probably still last the day but it'd be pretty low so I tend to do a top-up charge. The supplied charger tops the phone up really quickly, which heats the phone up a little more than I'd like so I tend to use a medium speed charger most of the time, but it's great if I'm in a hurry.",2020年11月17日 在美国审核
"Everything you need, nothing you don't.","Google has finally been able to make use of their customer feedback to create one of the most practical phones money can buy, at a price that is almost impossible to turn down.Pros:-Beautiful, bright, OLED screen that screams of a value point much much higher that where it currently sits.-Powerful camera features, especially Night Sight from its big brothers, that works fantastically in all sorts of difficult lighting conditions.-Good battery life, easily serviceable for a full day because of the efficient processor.-Great feeling and looking build (not sure what all the hype is about glass backs when plastic feels this good)-Wonderful haptic feedback and full-sounding loudspeaker-Headphone jack is back!-Rear fingerprint sensor that serves as notification pull-down-Wonderful size and form factor.

Battery life better than expected,"I typically buy a ""flagship"" phone every 3-4 years until the battery craps out. My last HTC10 went through 3 batteries before I finally cracked the screen and had to buy a new phone. I had been eyeballing the pixels for a while because they don't have all the carrier bloat and pre-loaded apps.I was pleasantly surprised to find this had just android with no third party apps burned into the rom. The setup was easy and pulled data from my old phone as well as all the updated versions of the apps from my old phoneBattery life is just crazy. The phone came with about 60% charge. The included fast charger topped it off pretty fast. I wanted to condition the battery by running it way down before recharging a few times. I was kinda shocked that it took almost 3 days to get the phone down to &lt;30% with my typical usage. Adaptive battery is on by default, and I typically have about 3 hours of screen time per day, and it hasn't had me searching for a charger once. This phone was advertised as having an all day battery and I'm sure it is true for heavy users. But for those that aren't on social media all day, this thing will be running for at least 2 days before you have to charge it. The battery life is just awesome.Also, in the first week my phone took 1 major and 2 minor updates which was nice. All my previous carrier phones would get at most 2 updates over their lives.

First Pixel Best Pixel,"I bought this on a whim after using various Galaxy phones since 2013.Being very adjusted to that version of Android OS that Galaxy uses, it's weird at first to see Google's take on an Android OS but after only about an hour or two, it's pretty convenient in this phone.My least favorite part about getting a new phone is transferring all my previous data to a new device, but Android to Android makes this process so streamlined, I had all my music, photos, apps, wallpapers, and smaller settings in about 15 minutes from when I first booted the phone up.A few things I think that makes this device stand out is that it's like an iPhone XS with an Android OS running it.The display is clear and sharp, the touch is consistent, the camera is superb for the price that you pay, and the software is rather simple and clean to use.If you're concerned about the punch-out camera in the top left of the screen like I was, don't worry.It's barely noticeable when using the device like normal.This phone's size is pretty comfortable when it comes to one handed use. The matte finish on the back side gives the device a nice feel when it's being used.So far, I really like my Pixel 4a and I'm happy I jumped ship.If you're someone who wants a phone for more basic tasks while being streamlined, then pick this up and give it a go, you won't be disappointed.",2020年10月22日 在美国审核
Better than my old Galaxy Note 10+ at 1/3 of the price.,"With this phone, the hardware and the software are allowed to integrate into their perfect potential. Google being the creator of both is likely what makes this phone better than its (overpriced) competitors. I haven't had the phone for quite a month yet, so I'll update this review if I need to. Here's where a more ""budget"" phone surprisingly stands out:1) The speaker has more clarity versus that of the Note10+.2) The fingerprint reader on the back has a much higher success rate than the Note10+'s (in regards to accuracy). It is also easier to physically use.3) Google kindly allows for the bootloader to be unlocked. So if you are feeling bold, you can load on a custom ROM. (Who knows? Maybe that would help you learn to love coding; it did for me.)4) Insane battery life. I charge it every other night. And this isn't with light use; I'd say the same might be true for you.5) The ergonomics of the phone make it easy on the hand to hold. It rarely falls out of my hand, unlike the Note10+.It really should get a star off for not being water-resistant, and another half-star off for not supporting wireless charging. But it's just such a well-performing machine that I refuse to subtract anything from my rating.TL;DR - This is the closest Android you can get to what makes an iPhone so special, which is the hardware and software being tightly integrated from the factory.",2021年2月21日 在美国审核
The best value phone under $500 (at least in North America).,"I had the Pixel 4a for a month in late 2020, and I generally liked the phone. The most important part that makes this phone great is the price, $350. It's not going to get you any top-tier iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but it gives you everything the general user would possibly need - a decently fast Snapdragon 730G SOC, 6GB RAM, and 128GB storage. That's something that not even the $830 base configuration of iPhone 12 gets you.Of course, being $350 there are a few things that it misses out on compared to higher-tier phones. One of those things would be the plastic unibody build over something like a metal and glass sandwich. On a phone of this price point it's fine, though I did have a bit of plastic creaking near the SIM slot. It was just an annoyance at worst, because the rest of the plastic build felt fine.Wireless charging is also not present, this may disappoint some that used it but it didn't bother me cause I never used wireless charging on my iPhone 8.There's no water resistance either, which did raise my eyebrows a bit before I bought the phone but I don't submerge my phone in water or take it to very dusty places.One thing this does have that the $700 Pixel 5 doesn't have is a headphone jack. So if you still use anything with a 3.5mm plug, this phone has you covered with no need for adapters! The speakers are also quite good, with one speaker on the bottom next to the USB-C port and one built into the earpiece.As for the software, it's got three years of updates which is better than many Android manufactures, but it still won't top Apple's software support. I did notice a few software bugs when I used it, mainly with YouTube Vanced's PIP mode after a certain amount of time. Restarting fixed the issue but it was an annoyance. Hopefully that was just Android 11 and that gets fixed with a future update.Battery life is also pretty decent, better than the aging battery on my iPhone 8 since I could comfortably leave it off the charger for one night. Given that it's a small phone by today's standards it's not going to be a battery life king, but it's better than the $400 iPhone SE.The size is something I loved about this phone, my hands are relatively small and I like my phone to be pocketable, which is something that I'm not a fan of with most new phones being over 6 inches in size. The 5.81-inch edge-to-edge screen Is of a similar size to my iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, thus I could easily use it with one hand and it fit well in my pockets. This is something I'm sure is greatly appreciated by those who also like smaller phones.The camera has been the definition of the Pixel phones since the first ones launched in 2016. This phone has an amazing single 12MP lens, mostly made great by Google's computational photography software. Night mode was very nice to use, as in the scenarios I used it in it helped out take better photos at night. I'm no expert with cameras so I don't know much about white balance, dynamic range, etc. I do like how this phone gives you one great camera as opposed to other manufacturers which give you like seven different pretty-much-useless camera sensors.Overall, this is the phone to buy if you're on a budget of less than $500 and you want something that will fulfill all the general needs. I would suggest going for the Pixel 4a 5G version if you can afford a $500 phone as that has a second ultrawide camera lens, a faster Snapdragon 765G SOC, and as the name says, 5G connectivity. That phone will overall will give you a very very close experience to the Pixel 5, but if you don't have that much to put down for a phone, and if you like the standard 4a's smaller size, this phone is the way to go. I highly recommend it and I would personally pick this any day of the week over a similarly priced phone from a China brand like Oppo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Vivo, etc.",2021年3月10日 在美国审核

I like it!,"I have always purchased the economical Moto G smartphones in the past and they have been adequate for my use.I recently decided to upgrade to the Pixel 4a for the faster processor and additional memory and I have really enjoyed using it this past month.I really like the nice compact size, the absence of bloatware, nice looking photos, fast response and great display.The battery lasts one or two days depending on your settings and usage of course and it charges very quickly.Android upgrades should arrive more quickly as well since it's a Google product.I certainly recommend this phone and I am very happy with the purchase.",2021年9月7日 在美国审核
Good so far,"Traded up from a 4yo lg.The 4a processor is much faster. The camera takes good pics. Battery life is double the lg.The learning curve is steep. I do NOT like google for the simple reason that nothing is intuitive. If you don't know which icon to push, and in which order, you will be frustrated.But, it works as designed.I bought the clear silicon cover and 2pak of lens covers that applied cleanly without bubbles.The file transfer was remarkably drama-free. Justpop in your sim card, connect the cable back-to-back and follow the simple promos. Done.",2020年10月12日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price,Just received it. So far I love it. Lots of storage. Fastest phone I ever owned. Camera is awesome and fun to play with. Charges fast but gets warm while it charges which cud be a safety hazard maybe? Overall I'm impressed with my first Google phone verses Samsung. Get 3 years of updates so I will be keeping this phone for at least 3 years if not longer if I'm still happy with the phone. Not laggy like my old Samsung galaxy J7 was super slow at some tasks. This phone moves a lot faster than my old outdated phone. Thanks Google,2021年5月29日 在美国审核

One month of use shows it to be a solid phone,"I have been using this phone for about a month now and am really happy with it.Chief among the reasons I got it was its camera reviews.It does take great pictures.In addition, Google gives unlimited back up to its Pixel phones.Battery life is solid.I charge nightly and while I drive... but it wouldn't matter.Compared to my previous Moto, this thing sips power.It has 6 gig of ram, which means it will stay speedy for a couple years.There is no external memory... but the 128 gig onboard is plenty.I bought mine unlocked (it will work with pretty much any carrier) and I use it on the Hello Mobile network (they piggyback T-Mobile).It helps to be a bit of a geek to get set up on Hello Mobile (all online, no stores) but once set up it is the cheapest out there.I get 4 lines of unlimited everything for 70 bucks a month.",2020年12月19日 在美国审核
Pleasantly surprised!,"I bought this for my son because of the price point and heard it was a decent phone. Of course teenagers being teenagers, I suspended his phone privileges and got a chance to play with it. I have to say this has to be one of the smoothest android experiences I've ever had. I have to say I'm a little jealous because I've paid for higher end phones and they don't run this smooth. It's not extremely great at anything but it's perfect for someone who wants a pure Android experience without a bunch of glitches, bloating and great support.

"Plastic Fantastic, A worthy upgrade","Picked one of these up after T-Mobile upgraded their network and forced me to upgrade from mybeloved Nexus 5. the plastic construction doesnt bother me, since it lives in a thick case. Overall size is on par with the Nexus 5, but with a way larger screen. Sound is decent, battery life is like 3 days of occasional youtube videos, setting up apps and a lot of standby. The camera is outstanding, the headphone jack is a nice to have and the overall construction is spot on. Great for a one handed sized smartphone. Biggest complaints are the lack of wireless charging and how annoying it's going to be to dismantle if i need to replace the battery in a few years, but as a replacement to my 7 year old workhorse, it's looking pretty good.",2020年11月14日 在美国审核

The battery charges fairly quickly and the phone does not overheat like my Samsung used to do. It transferred all of my data from my old phone to here with ease. I like the photos.

Great phone for the price point,"Honestly I love this phone. It's quite the step up from the Galaxy j7 I had before.

It's able to zoom in really nicely and even has a night time mode where it is able to capture more light which makes dark pictures much more vibrant. The screen is very scratch resistant as well and even tho the phone is made out of plastic, i havent had any issues with body damage even tho i have dropped it once or twice.

All you need in a phone with an amazing camera,"The phone itself is absolutely amazing, performance is great, even though some reviewers are saying that it is falling behind some other competitors, I haven't really noticed any hiccups or lags while using the phone and apps almost always stay open in the background unless I open like 20 of them.I don't really play games on my phone but I think it will handle most games with ease unless u want to play on max settings.Screen is really really good, I came from a samsung so I know what a good amoled screen feels like and this one is great, even at this resolution the image and the color accuracy is really sharp, could have been a little brighter though, but haven't really bothered me its good enough even in the sunlight.Camera is absolutely amazing, especially at this price point, its flagship class. Night mode is absolutely amazing. Takes amazing pictures, sharp and color accurate. Video recording is great as well. The only downside can be considered the fact that sometimes when you take a pictures it takes like 2-3 second to process it, but other than that it is really really good, like one of the best.Many people say that the holepunch camera cutout is annoying, but it is in a such a spot that it disappears in use, even during watching videos and movies. I almost never notice it while watching content or browsing, unless I absolutely have to see an info that is written on that corner.Battery, the probably the only downside of this phone, you might be like why? well because it is inconsistent, it can last you with the same exact use on most days for like 6 and even 7 hours! but on others it might last 3 or 4, I don't understand why is the battery like this, from what I have researched in background it runs some kind of android system process that bottlenecks it from time to time. But overall I would rate it 4 stars, would have been 5 if it was not like this.Fingerprint scanned is, well really really fast, almost instant, but like other fingerprint scanners, if your fingers are wet it wont recognize them, but its like this on like 90% of others phones which I have used with this feature so It doesn't really bother me.Build quality is good, I don't mind the plastic back because it feels really good in your hand, its smooth and not slippery, it is really nice to hold it in hand, but as most other users I have a case on it.Other google features really make this phone a good experience, for example the music recognition and others.Overall this phone is a solid 4.7 out of 5, as I said the battery can be a mix bag but other than that it is great. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good phone, which has some good features, amazing camera, good battery life on most days, nice screen, good performance and solid, nice feel in the hand.

"Affordable, nondescript, and capable.","Been a fan of this line of phones since I tried Google's first Pixel. Everything I liked about that phone is also what I like about this one, as they pretty much left all the key elements the same. They did fit in a better chipset, and a nicer screen, as well as use more plastic. I don't mind the plastic, as it doesn't shatter when my butterfingers fling the thing across my room on accident.While I do find Google's mere existence (as it is, being an all-powerful monopoly with worryingly increasing influence in our lives... which I say on an Amazon review. Ha.), I can say that their software, and phone hardware, is fantastic.It does eveything quickly, with no hang; although, if you try hard enough you can slow it for a moment. Software is clean and it facilitates its own use more than it hinders it. No flashiness, all subtle polish over the original design. Very nice.A very hardy battery.No flashy outer design, very few visible markings.The BEST part is how clicky the volume and power switches are. It's an actual pleasure to use, everytime.The camera is adequate. Pretty disappointing, actually. I loved the first Pixel for its image quality, and this one is identical. Literally. They did improve the computational processing, but... eh, four years later and I really expected better. The sensor is quite dated. BUT, it does its job, and slightly better than the first iteration, so, I am not too deposed over it.Overall, love this thing. Although, it IS a budget phone. Do consider that. However, if you are looking for an exemplary version of a hudget phone, with good software (brought to you by our Google overlords), then this is a great option.",2021年6月18日 在美国审核

"Smooth interface, and just the perfect size","I bought it a while ago to use mainly as a phone/PDA. The interface on the phone is very minimalistic and smooth. The aspect ratio on the screen is a bit odd and takes some getting used to, but due to the narrowness of the phone, it actually fits perfectly in my hand (with case), and pocket too... The feel on the phone itself is a bit on the slippery side, so just get a rubber case and you'll be fine(everyone uses that anyways). The phone has a lot of automated functions built directly into the phone, so you don't need a ton of third party apps to do basic things. The only core function 3rd party apps that i currently use are:-Soft screenlocking (i'm not a huge fan of button pressing)-fingerprint gesture (so i can lock and unlock with just a finger on the sensor)-document scanner (this should be built directly into camera apps today, but you know...)I like that the home button has been built into a soft one (like i said i'm not a huge fan of button pressing)The swipe keyboard is very quick and gets the right words.The only problem i've encountered in the 7 months of usage is that you have to keep the light sensor cleaned, because the adaptive brightness will occasionaly make the screen unusable in sunlight, then you have to get to a shade to manually turn up the brightness. But this isn't directly a manufacturing flaw, just something that you need to keep in mind",2021年6月9日 在美国审核
Works well,"I replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge with this phone.So far, it's been a great phone. I decided the high-dollar flagship phones just aren't worth the cost for me.I don't use most of the features. I don't use the fingerprint reader or face recognition.I simply want a phone that doesn't lag. The camera is great. Battery life is better than I expected. I don't think I'll fill the 128gb of storage. I hold on to my electronics for as long as I can, so if this will last me more than two or three years, then I'll consider whatever Google has at that time.",2020年11月7日 在美国审核

Excellent budget phone,"It's really really good. Now that I've had for half a year I can say that is an excellent phone. Oled screen(that equals good), perfect size even for my big hands, and the camera is super nice. My problems with it is that after some time the battery starts to run dry really fast, at the begining it lasted the hole day, now I barely get 6-7 hours out of it.

Great for the price,"Coming from a flagship iPhone 11 Pro, my standards were high. I switched to Android because Google Fi WiFi calling was not available on iPhone. My initial impression was that the phone felt cheap because of the plastic body, but it is justified because of the price tag.+The build quality is great+Screen resolution is not as good as the iPhone, but good enough if you're just going to be watching YouTube videos and using social media.-I believe the battery size is larger than the iPhone 11 Pro, but I feel like I have to charge more throughout the day. This might be because the adaptive battery feature needs to learn more about my usage.-Auto Rotation is not as good as the iPhone. It takes longer to auto rotate. Sometimes it just doesn't rotate at all.Overall, I can't complain about the phone with such a low price tag. It works well and takes good ""point and shoot"" pictures.",2020年10月23日 在美国审核
Everything I wanted,"I switched from a Samsung Galaxy and I couldn't be happier. The price, the durability, the size, and the available apps are all exactly what I wanted. I don't need a phone so big it's uncomfortable to carry in my pocket and I simply see no value in a 5G phone right now. Google hit it out of the park with this phone and at less than half the cost of a flagship phone, I'm amazed I don't see more people carrying a 4.The lack of wireless charging and the less than outstanding battery life is a drawback but that's the price you pay for not going flagship.

Great upgrade if you like some things and not everything,"Mine replaced a Pixel (1). I loved the fingerprint reader on the back.

I did not need the 5G microwave blasting me. 4G is just fine. Like the new features like swipe to go back...too bad not also swipe forward in browser (I hate that on a phone).

Fantastic Phone,"I just tried upgrading to a Pixel 6 and ended up coming back to my Pixel 4a.The battery life lasts almost all day, after a year of heavy use. I drop it constantly and phone is still in commission. It's a nice size, not a brick that won't even fit in one's pocket. The fingerprint reader on the back is intuitive and fast, unlike Pixel 6's which often did not work.Cons: can be slow or unresponsive sometimes, but not as a rule. I desperately wish this had an ultra wide lens, but it does not. Update cycle is ending Aug 2023, and that feels a little soon.All things considered, this has to be the one of best $350 Android phones out there.",2022年6月11日 在美国审核

It's certainly a big step up in terms of speed and device storage—no surprise there. Performance comes at the cost of battery life, which is good but not great on the 4a, and about 30-40% shorter than on my two-year-old Moto X4.

"Great Battery Life, works with US Cellular",I was worried about buying a phone sight unseen especially since some reviewers got bricked phones. I got my pixel and had no problems getting it on my US cellular plan. Watched YouTube all day and only went to 50% battery. Never had to even use battery saver. I was worried about the smaller size but it's a non issue. Great screen resolution and takes great pictures for a phone. I turned off the finger print recognition because with a case on it's hard to get a good read. I turned off the gesture controls instead using the normal Android three button set up since they don't work well. For 350 bucks it's honestly the best phone you can get.,2021年3月26日 在美国审核
I like,Upgraded from an S6 I got when that model was just released. Better performance-wise on every level. Very fast phone and I love the battery system. It holds a charge significantly better than the S6. No reason why you can't go a full day with a full charge even if you're watching videos all day. It also learns your habits and lets you know in advance if you should charge your phone.Another cool feature is it allows you to watch videos on Youtube while using other apps even if you don't have a premium subscription.

Excelente por el precio. Contento con la compra,"Luego de probar el teléfono una semana, mis conclusiones más relevantes (y por las cuales recomiendo este teléfono), son las siguientes:- Cámara 9/10. Sólo le falta versatilidad, en calidad visual y detalle de lo MEJOR que hay en el mercado. En video es bueno, pero se podría haber mejorado un poco más (apple sigue siendo superior en esto).- Tamao 10/10. Muy ergonómico para el día a día, fácilmente se puede ocupar con una sola mano, liviano.- Software 8.5/10. Android de Google va muy fluido en este dispositivo, a pesar de que el chip 730G es inferior a otros (765G). Puntos positivos, los 3 aos de actualizaciones, Google assistant y que no tiene app's basura como MIUI y Samsung. Sin embargo android 11 hay que mejorarlo un poco más, lo cuál es entendible ya que se ha actualizado recientemente.- Batería 7/10. Para mi uno de los puntos más ""flojos"". Google hizo una buena optimización con el consumo de la batería y se debe destacar, fácilmente se puede llegar a un día de uso (en cuarentena he ocupado bastante el consumo multimedia, YT, instagram). Sin embargo, no sé cómo se comportará en un ao más, razón por la cuál hubiera agradecido tener una batería de al menos 3400 mA o más.- Diseo y Construcción 7/10. Destacar que el teléfono en mano se ve mucho mejor que en fotos, o entrega una sensación un poco más premium de lo que realmente esperaba. El acabado en plástico me da cierta sensación de fragilidad si el teléfono se llegara a caer y temo por la pantalla (espero estar equivocado). Por último, visualmente se debe mejorar, sigue siendo un teléfono poco atractivo para la mayoría de usuarios. Creo que si Google mejorara sus diseos, podrían atraer a muchos más consumidores.-Precio 10/10. A pesar del costo de envío e importación, sigue siendo mejor alternativa que los modelos que se venden en mi país (Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi, Motorola, etc.) por el mismo precio.",2020年10月10日 在美国审核

"Great phone, but returning","I bought the Pixel 4a after using a Pixel 2XL for two years. There are a lot of wonderful features within the 4a, but I am just not as impressed with it as I was hoping. For the price, it is a stellar phone. It's fast, it's pretty, it doesn't look as cheap as it is, and I honestly can't say anything back about it - besides 2 things.Even after using my 2XL for two years, the battery life is still better than the 4a. I find myself charging the 4a several times a day, whereas I rarely had to charge my 2XL once thought the day.Also, the camera. It is SO fuzzy with the front camera, and the rear camera honestly didn't blow me away. I'm a professional photographer, so I'm a bit snobby about the camera on my phone.Honestly the battery life for the 4a is just okay. If you want a cheap, high quality phone that packs a punch and a half, get this one. I personally am returning mine and buying the 4XL in hopes I'm more satisfied!",2020年10月10日 在美国审核

Decent for the price but there are annoying tradeoffs,"For the price this is really a lot of phone (nice display, good camera, 128 gig storage, 3yrs of OS upgrades). But there are several negatives you should be aware of:Battery life - OK, but not greatProcessor - OK, but not greatDisplay - looks great but there is an area about 10 - 20 pixels big all around the right edge and bottom where the phone does not register any touches. Very annoying in games and any app with buttons way at the right/bottom.The Pixel Launcher takes a huge chunk of the display for Google to use as they please (can be fixed by switching to the Nova Launched, but it's annoying to have to do that)Not water proofNo wireless chargingI really like the smaller size and can live with the problems for a couple years, but I'll be upgrading in 3yrs...UPDATE: Added 1 star - the biggest disappointment for me was the dead-to-the-touch zone around the edge, it turns out that was caused by Android 11 gestures. Once I changed the UI to instead use the 3 buttons (Back\Home\Nav) at the bottom, that problem went away.",2021年1月30日 在美国审核

Snappy phone but it keeps ending up on the floor!,"Great, responsive phone but it keeps plummeting!Keep it on a rough surface so it doesn't walk off on you!Not sure what is going on but I keep finding this phone on the floor.A few times I've actually caught it in the act, just slipping off a surface that I've laid it on, so I've started to put it inside a box or other lipped surface to keep it from walking off.I suspect the screen and slight lip might be enough to reduce the friction so that even small vibrations can send it off in some direction but I've never caught anything actually doing it, and I didn't have the problem with my old phone (maybe it liked me more?)It's a cute source of jokes in my house.I've had the phone for about a week and a half and so far am liking it a lot.Pros: Nice weight, good responsivenessCons: Misinterprets light touches, turns off while looking at it.The cons might be something I just need to hunt down settings for.It seems to be over sensitive when I try to swipe.It's often drilling down to the next screen when I don't want it to.It has also shut the screen off during a few tasks, so it is a lot different than my previous phone.That being said, it has the features that I like and is wonderfully nice and responsive, even if it does like skydiving a bit too much.",2020年9月3日 在美国审核
Good enough,"I've had my phone a couple of months. It replaced a Moto Droid Turbo 2, which was a great phone. I chose the 4a in part because it's a smaller unit. I don't want a cigar box in my pocket. The compromise was on how narrow it is -- a bit too narrow, less screen, not as substantial in the hand. But those are tradeoffs. Nice to have a clean Android install and updates!<br>PROSComfortable sizeGood displayResponsive and smooth actionBattery life is excellent - I get 2-3 days but watch little video, play no games, keep location off unless I need itCamera has pretty good night modeI don't use a ""wrapper"" on my phone - it slides in/out of pocket easier ""bare"". Dropped it once, no damage. Fingers crossed.(I don't use face recog or fingerprint reader)GREAT price!CONSA bit too narrowDisplay is not as good as the reviews would have you believeDitto on the camera -- I'm not very happy with it. The controls are clumsy, including the exposure hotspot.I really miss the Turbo 2's ""wave your hand"" to see notifications. Seems to me this would be easy to implement on all phones.Screen is slow to populate when bootingIt's probably Android or the app, not the phone, but it often plays the wrong ringtones on the alarmThe only other phone I considered seriously (I looked at a lot, ""in person""!) is the Samsung S21 (not 5G) at a higher price. If I were to do it again I might be swayed to get that instead. The camera is just better as is the screen. But I'll be honest -- $349 for an unlocked 4a is hard to beat! Unless your phone is a really big deal to you, the 4a does the job nicely.One last thing: I'll never buy another locked phone again!</br>",2021年5月11日 在美国审核
Trash,Initially the phone was exactly what I wanted. Used the phone for a few weeks then it got stuck in a reboot loop then software issues preventing me from backing up my info.So I contacted Amazon. because since the phone won't stay on long enough or I can't back up or erase my personal and importantsmall business info from the phone I'm not comfortable sending it back.... Amazon won't issue me a refund without returning the phone. I'm not comfortable retuning the phone with my info and accounts open.I tried to explain this to several times to customer service and they told me to contact google. Called google from a different phone and Google customer service is closed because of covid restrictions.This is BS.So it's looking like I may be stuck with a $350 paperweight.,2020年12月4日 在美国审核
"Battery life sucks,","Google claims phone battery last 24 hours, not even close. 12hours max so far with data and bluetooth turned off and shuting down some other bells and whistles. I don't use my phone much. Spotify check out FB. I haven't given the camera a test yet. I switch off the annoying gestures and put the home button on. It's easier to navigate that way. I hate that the charging cord is c to c on both ends. That means you need to take your charger with you. Stupid. Great my car has USB plugs I can't use.

Improve notification system. PLEASE!,"I gave this 3 stats because of the software. I felt like google could've done a better job especially since this is a pure android device. The notification system is stupid.When someone text me and I respond to it from the notification window the text remains there in the notifications. If I'm the last person to respond why do I need to see my own .message in the notifications?? That's stupid! If I respond the notification needs to go away!If get a bunch of notifications (emails, text) and I swipe them away, more notifications show up IMMEDIATELY. Sometimes they aren't even new. I literally have to press ""clear all"" 3x for the notifications to go away.I also don't like that if I'm on a website that I'm trying to upload a image to, the phone sends you on a wild goose chase to find your ""gallery"". By default it brings up ""recent images"" and I think that's dumb. You should be able to choose what it defaults to. Even still when you press on ""camera"" it'll still take you to another screen that you have to press ""camera"" again just to get to the images you took with your camera.These things can be fixed with software but it's super annoying, especiy the notifications. Not to mention I bought a fossil smart watch that runs wear OS and if I check a email from last year, the watch will send me a notification from that email like I just received it! STUPID!

UNUSABLE TOUCHSCREEN with Android 11 and Screen Protector,"This was a great phone. Full stop, great phone.However, after the recent Android 11 update, the phone is UNUSABLE with a screen protector.

Hard to find an inexpensive phone with NFC these days.,"Is the camera super high resolution? No, but the processing is great and you don't need more than 4,000 pixels wide for social media posts. Is the battery super high capacity? No again, but I never need to charge it more than once per day, and at the end of the day I still have 20 hours of battery left. Maybe if you shoot a lot of video this phone wouldn't hold out long, but for my very average usage it's fine. Does it have a fancy glass or metal case? No, but most people with fancy looking phones put a case on them anyway. Or they crack.Does it have a punch hole camera? Yes, and here's my only major gripe. I never use the selfie camera, and Netflix seems to be the only major streaming app that can stretch to full screen. All of the other apps I have (Hulu, HBO Max, Prime Video) slam the video to the right hand side which will round off the corners of 16:9 video. The punch hole itself doesn't even bother me anymore. I just want full screen video in my streaming apps, and it's not even Google's fault on this one.The verdict is that the Pixel 4a is a solid budget smartphone. It gets regular security updates, is probably getting Android 12, doesn't have a terrible app launcher, and isn't going to crack like my glass back Motorola X4.",2021年3月5日 在美国审核
"Works, but glitchy - 2016 iPhone SE was better","My old iPhone SE died and i upgraded to the Pixel. It works, but I wish I would have bought the new SE instead. Battery life is good, camera is nice, it works as a smartphone, I like that it still has a headphone jack, but I expected more.The screen doesn't always respond (I try to expand from my home screen to view all apps, but it won't expand). I've already had to force restart it when it got stuck in an infinite startup loop (had it for only a month). I trained ""ok google"" for my voice, but it never works, however when I was listening to an audiobook in the car, for some reason the name ""Able"" activated google voice every time- super annoying. The first day, the alarm clock didn't go off (found out this is a known issue), and I was late for work. The top volume on the speaker is laughably quiet, so don't expect to be able to talk on speakerphone in the car. I can't seem to configure my work and personal stuff to be on the same screen (it forces me to segment them, so I have two gmail apps and two calendar apps - might be cool for some folks, but I don't like it). The fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone for your pointer finger, which isn't ergonomic at all. Google maps is slow to respond to route changes.I'm not a die hard Apple person, but I've found the iphone SE from years ago to be superior in nearly every way. In 2020 at this price point from Google, I expected more, now I'm stuck. I do not recommend this phone.",2020年11月11日 在美国审核

Nice phone while it lasted,"I've never broken one of my phones before.I had this phone fewer than 9 months before it took a decent blow and became inoperable.I suppose the amount of time I had it before it got beaten is irrelevant, but who says you're supposed to think while reading product reviews!?It suffered an arguably sharp, blunt hit to the poly carbonate rear case and the phone shows no signs of damage whatsoever.Not sure if the screen broke or the mainboard broke, but it now shows nothing but a garbled, distorted green grid of nonsense for a few seconds when powered on.The reason I mention all this is because this is one of the few premium-ish phones that does not have a metal, glass or ceramic body.A HARD outer shell may very well be worth the extra cost... the phone was in a case when it took its fatal blow.As far as living with the phone day in and day out, pretty good.Worked really well on Fi.Great coverage, decent enough camera, responsive, adequate battery for how I use it.Really kinda my favorite phone, and no frills.Too bad it's not able to better tolerate the inevitable oopsie.Again, never broke one of my phones before.Typically the battery becomes usable or I just feel like having something new after 18 months or so before I get a new one.Really bummed to have this thing leave my completely high and dry from what I consider to be an otherwise nearly inconsequential incident.Would I recommend it?Yes, if you're even more careful than I've been in my phone-ownership career (15 years or so) and if you get a great big stupid case for it and never take it out.RIP, little Pixel 4a",2021年9月17日 在美国审核
Good phone,"I was using a Moto 4G Plus for many years. Then it just bricked. It was time to get a new one. My husband has been pleased with his Pixel so I looked at them too.My pros:* Great little phone if you like smaller screen* No bloatware. You can remove some of the little extras Google puts on there but it's nothing like Samsung's cramware or other phones (this is why I stayed with Motorola too - nothing to take up all your space other than the OS)* Latest Android features, which became increasingly important to me. Not all phones keep up. My Moto was two versions behind - what a detriment!* Battery life is pretty good* Long lasting phones with little troubles...you can have this phone for years and be happy and trouble free!My cons:* Small! I was used to the Moto's larger screen. This is so small. I should have gone into the store to look at the phones - I'd have gone with a larger screen Pixel. I'm older and have eye issues and this 4a is so cute and just tiny. Still too hard on my eyes even though I've adjusted it.* Problems with contact resizing comment area on YouTube underneath the video. What is that?!* Difficult to learn the touch system. I'm still messing up over a month after getting this. Hard to minimize, hard to pull things back up. It doesn't do what you want it to do.* Big problem at the bottom of the screen with the swipe bar white line and corner elements showing up on the top of everything. I hate it and so does everyone else. You'd have to root the phone to get rid of that. I've reported this to Google. That little bar interferes with the buttons of some apps and you can't proceed (Continue) in some apps I've needed.Other than that, this has been my second favorite phone. My fave was a Moto G I had - it was the perfect phone for me but died a year later. So sad. This is why I chose Pixel because these phones last long, and in that way I think a good value for your money.",2021年8月10日 在美国审核
Price-performance and features are amazing,"I bought this to replace an ailing LG6. I was most impressed with the setup. I did it all in the car, riding as a passenger. You just connect the old phone and the new one with a cable, switch over the SIM card, and start the transfer. It installs the phone with the new SIM card, no waiting at Verizon to do it and then paying them for the non-service. It transfers contacts, photos, and other content. All the apps are setup for transfer, but it waits until you have WiFi to start the process. Non-sensitive ones came over with passwords transferred, too. Sensitive ones, like bank card, mobile banking, and other security-sensitive apps required you to sign on again. Swiping instead of 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen finally had the best of me, but there is an option to install the traditional 3-button controls, and it works like a charm.

I want a phone that is light and small, with a good enough camera. I don't play games on my phone so I don't need no latest and greatest silicones. I don't worry about drops because it's polycarbonate, and I disliked glass backs ever since the LG V30. The Pixel 4a is simple, it's clean, it works, and it runs the latest Android.

Far too fragile and the touchscreen is below average for typing.,"After using an iPhone 7 for five years (two of those years with a bulky battery case because a small bend in the chassis meant I could not get the battery replaced) I decided to switch back to Android.I hate the facial recognition compared to fingerprint, missed having a headphone jack and needing to use a dongle to connect to my car stereo, and I also felt that it really isn't necessary to spend $700+ on a new iPhone.The iPhone SE is pretty basic for $450 and the $350 Google Pixel 4a seemed like a great choice.Look, you already know that this has a great camera, good screen, good fingerprint sensor, headphone jack, etc. - here is why it's a 3/5 for me.Even with a case, the screen cracked after falling a few feet onto a hard surface after only five weeks of use.Amazon covered a screen repair which was really awesome, but there is no reason this phone should be so fragile even with a hard case.I really don't see this lasting more than maybe two years and I'll likely go back to Apple at that point.Just too many cut corners here.",2021年7月10日 在美国审核
Pixel is synonymous with great photos.  Easy upgrade.,"My Pixel 2 was a great camera phone but it was showing its age.I shopped and compared.I really wanted my next phone to have an optical telephoto lens.But the few phones that have that feature are at least 3 times as expensive as the Pixel 4a.If it had a telephoto lens at a similar price it would get 5 stars.(I don't understand the need for the wide angle lens on other new models of the Pixel.)I could take a ""real camera"" with me, but I have found in recent years that when I do, I still use the phone for most shots.The Pixel 4a does not have the latest engine, but it is still much faster and smoother than my old one.It doesn't have the largest battery, but for normal use battery life has been far better than on my old phone.One great feature of this phone was the easy transfer of files and apps from the old Pixel.I highly recommend this phone.",2021年3月15日 在美国审核
Such a Significant Upgrade,"The ""Google Pixel 4a"" is super fast, and the 128 GB is the right mix of storage. This is such a significant upgrade from my last cell phone that got fried when I jumped in the pool with it, a little careless on my part, I will have to be more careful with this one. I've been using this new phone for almost a month, and I haven't had any problems. Like I wrote, it is super fast and can upload Apps in a matter of moments. Plus, if you are one for not spending a lot of dough on the phone, the cost is most fair for what you get at the end. This is a top of the line phone that is a noticeable improvement from my last one that I had help installing from a family member. Still, we got this phone running without a hitch. I would say you got to know what you are doing. Not saying anyone can do get it to run so quickly out of the box without help. Still, those are the breaks, just know if you are like me, and you do fry our phone, all is not lost if you do buy this one, and you will be somewhat better off in the end if everything goes well. Also, the battery life on this thing is a great plus as well.",2020年9月14日 在美国审核
Beware trapware - merely opening this program will cost you,"Fine phone for the money.There is a program that comes with this phone called YouTube Music.I opened it to see if it would play my mp3's.

The fine print informed me that in a few weeks the free trial would roll over into a paid monthly subscription unless I cancelled before the trial period ended. I have spent days trying to cancel this, there is NO WAY to cancel a You Tube Music trial membership before the rollover. This is wrong, illegal, and basically theft of that first month's subscription payment.

Good phone!,"I'm coming from a samsung android note 9. Loved my note 9 but turns out I'm not that good with big bulky all glass expensive phones... Who woulda thought ... My whole back of my note 9 phone was shattered and the screen was cracked and I had an otterbox on it the entire time I had the thing. Long story short I bought the phone out after 2 years to switch services and when I went to switch they took my case off to switch sim cards and it was a shattered mess which I was highly disappointed about because I thought it was in good shape!. I could have gotten it fixed for around $400 or I could get a different phone. I didn't want nothing hella expensive I'm tired of having to pay extra for phone payments and then just breaking them because obviously I'm just not good with phones! I wanted something budget friendly with a good quality camera but still similar to androids system. I've been team android forever now I just really don't care for their picture quality though, I have tried iphone out as well I had the iphone x and it just wasn't for me, however I did love the picture quality, so since I've tried both ios and android and have certain things I like and disliked for both of them I figured it was time to give pixels a try!Pros:This phone is cute, little, and light weight phone, but like not so little that the screens no good. The screen to phone ratio is super nice and makes the phone feel smaller with a good sized screen. Which is what I wantedI was over having huge, heavy bulky phones, I have little hands and I constantly was dropping my bigger phones...Picture quality is awesome! It def beats android and I think it might even beat iphones!Easy set up with transferring from my old phone to this one.The backs plastic! Which that was what I was looking for! People complain that ""oh its so boring looking with the plain black plastic back""... I don't get it, so youd rather have a pretty glass back that you end up covering with a bulky case... Cause that makes so much sense...I like how you can either have the navigation buttons or you can use the swipe controls. I like this so your not stuck with one or the other.battery lifes pretty good the charge seems to last me as long as my note 9 did.It def seems very durable. I do have a screen protector along with a case on this phone, not even a good case or screen protector just something cheap I grabbed. I've dropped the phone a few times now and no have had no issues!Volume is also pretty goodCons:My biggest pet peeves with this phone isssss I hate the way screen shots are on this phone! Okay so the power button and the volume down button is how you take screen shots, which is normal for screen shots but on this phone the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side which makes it awkward to do and then sometimes when doing it the volume bar will pop up and turn everything all the way down and the bar just stays there which is annoying....I don't like how there's not as much customization as androids would have, such as changing the themes and stuff which sorta disappoints me.Conclusion:All in all, the pixel 4a really is not a bad budget phone for people like me that are just to rough for these high end all glass, thousand dollar phones... I would eventually like to get one of the nicer pixels this one was mostly to try it out and see if I even like them before getting one of the more expensive ones later down the road. Nice thing about pixels even there higher end phones such as the pixel 5 arent robbing you like some of these dang androids and iphones are!If your looking for a nice budget phone you won't go wrong getting this one.

I returned it and am using my older Android again with much less frustration,"The two great things about the pixel are it's price point and camera. Everything else including proper camera controls was forgotten.The main issue is the screen sensitivity, I have medium sized hands and fingers (size 9-10) and am quite adept at typing but I felt like I was losing my mind and motor skills trying not to fat finger this keyboard even at its tallest and least cluttered setting. I tried typing the same sentences on different devices and would have 4x the amount of errors on that keyboard. It does help to remove the glass screen protector but then you lose that layer of protection.Most of the new features and controls advertised are either novelties, poorly implemented, or downright dysfunctional. The gesture controls are chaotic. Basically making the entire edge of the screen a very sensitive swipe to go back which is more like the slightest touch will trigger it. Trying to scroll down through a long article... nope you triggered the back button and now you have to reload the page or app. Want to pass the phone to someone to show them a photo, nope either of you will likely trigger that back command and they'll wonder what you were trying to show them.So I switched back to the old 3 button layout but wait.. they put a button for Live Transcription right next to the Square ""Overview"" button so there have been many occasions that I unknowingly triggered it and drained my battery transcribing a walk through the woods or me muttering to myself while editing or programming.I use a lot of Google Home devices and it is getting annoying to have to avoid using the world Google like your saying Voldemort in some Rowling novel or else you get cursed with the Assistant trying to search for or make a music selection based off of a snippet of your completely unrelated conversation.Finally that lovely little camera has the worst most non-intuitive controls I have ever used on a phone. Sure you can get some great astrophotography shots but you have to turn on Night Sight mode and hope that the camera detects stars or something to trigger the mode. Yes you can't shoot astrophotography unless the phone thinks that is what you want. Try fighting phone controls in the late evening in 20 degree Yosemite park and you'll wish you had a DSLR with actual buttons so you can keep your gloves on, touch screen gloves are thin and don't work well due to aforementioned sensitivity issues. Switching between camera modes requires a swipe and then some have a popup so to go from Portrait mode to Slow-mo you have to carefully swipe over a couple icons and then touch one of the options that appears above video all with a very temperamental screen. It is not fun especially when your cat is being adorable and you miss shots.I also have a feeling this phone will be quickly unsupported by Google as they are already releasing things for the 5 and 5g models that aren't available for this one. Then it seems like they are randomly and silently removing features as well.For now I am going back to my old phone (a very unsupported, cracked, and dull LG G6) and now being both burnt out from the new Pixel / Android mobiles and the IOS options, I may just relieve myself of the burden of carrying a smart phone and go for a simpler approach.",2020年12月29日 在美国审核
good price is the only good thing about it,"I'm not a fan of this phone.Might return it, but what a hassle!It’s a good-looking and comfortable phone.Battery lasts for about 4-5 days.And it was much, much cheaper than other phones.(hmmm, wonder why?)First and most importantly, it constantly tell me I have no signal.I haven't moved, and have been with my carrier for many, many years, and this phone is the only phone that can't find the signal.Constantly.As in most of the time.Usage is not intuitive.It does many other very annoying things, and I can’t figure out how to make it stop doing the very annoying things.I went online for a user manual and the link sent me to a site to set up your new Pixel.Um, already done – where’s the user manual?There is no user manual – too bad, so sad.Also, a search of google, ironically, reaps no results on how to make the very annoying things stop.It is possible this phone is customizable, but you have to be a google master phone engineer to figure it out, and they’re sure as stuff not going to tell you.Bottom line for me was money.Calls generally work ok, as does text.But email?Holy C, you'd think I was asking it to do something easy!I have to slog through a full crap-load of automatic and unwanted questions (can’t answer the call without a question about contacts, can’t read a text without question about contacts, etc.) before I can do the common things.I do wonder if google even knows you can do that later IF you want to at all?So annoying!I also wish it had a home button as I'm forever accidentally calling people when swiping up which, as far as I have learned to date, appears to be the only way to get to the home screen and jumps right through contacts.Also have to go to home screen if I send an email because it kicks me out.If I want to read and respond to the next email, gotta start anew from the home screen.Stupid.Would not buy this phone again, although I think google could easily fix the operating system.I wonder if they ever will, though.Doubt it.Very disappointing.",2021年1月12日 在美国审核

Mine died when I had it in the pocket of my waterproof ski pants for 2.5 hours on the ski slope, on a rainy day. The pocket was zipped closed the entire time, and I didn't remove the phone from the pocket until I was in my car. The pocket was not wet inside, even the tissue in the pocket was dry. However my phone's display, when turned on, lit up, but was unresponsive to touch. A day later the same. I can see a very slight haze of humidity on the inside of the selfie lens.

Has a good camera, though I really should snap more pictures and videos with it. front facing camera is great for video calls. Of all of the phones that I have used this is the best in that category.Cons: the UI has a learning curve to it. so take the tutorial. Though this is a new feature with the current Android OS, there is no back button. Yeah I know. I miss it too. there is no slot for a micro SD card. Not a problem if you use the cloud to back them up, but I don't always go were I have a data connection, plus I like to move my videos between devices. And the front facing camera feels off. I personally like the centered punch out cameras on the LG and Samsung phones that I have used.Overall. this is a good value. Even with the arrival of 5G network on the horizon. I recommend this as it fits in the palm of my hand. Has a well matched processor and ram configuration and has 128GB of storage. which should be enough for most users. the front facing camera works really well on video calls even in low light. And the WiFi radio has a good to great range, depending on frequency used.",2020年12月3日 在美国审核
I meet problem when using Pixel 4a,"I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I upgraded to Android 11. My camera can no longer be used normally. I can’t use the rear lens without dropping it on the ground or getting water. After turning the camera apps on, there is a black screen. I need to wait a few minutes to see the image. Even if I see the image, it is blurred and out of focus, and it will get stuck immediately. This makes me very bad for the pixel 4a. I think the core advantage of the pixel 4a as a cheap phone is that its camera function is comparable to flagship phones. But when I can no longer use its camera function, it loses its appeal to me. Can’t use the rear the lens is a problem even for daily use. I can't even scan the QR Code. I am quite disappointed with Google phones. I hope someone can help me solve the problem. I have tried using safe mode, using Third-party camera software, clearing camera data, and even Restoring the phone to the factory settings, but I still can't restore my camera functions.",2020年9月14日 在美国审核
Too damn small!,"Coming from a Pixel XL v.1, this screen is actually smaller. The measurement corner to corner is not the best way, IMHO, as most companies make the phones taller to increase reported screen size. If there was a 4a XL, that would be nice, but will have to wait for the 4a 5g to see what the dimensions really are. Yes, for me, the extra money for larger XL size and 5g will be well spent.",2020年8月27日 在美国审核

I Wish I Had Never Bought It -- Add One-Touch Answer Accessibility Please!,"I got this phone specifically because a beloved family member went into the hospital and, recognizing the start of a long and stressful season for my family, I did not want to be working with a less-than-excellent mobile phone.Stupid decision. Because we we've been in crisis mode since, I did not have time to return the phone, and now I get to decide whether to eat the cost... though it might be worth it to take a hammer to the thing.Problem 1--It is difficult to answer phone calls. Sometimes it shows me the ""dismiss / answer"" options to swipe, but sometimes my phone rings without anything changing on the screen, and I have to go to the home screen and choose the phone icon and if I'm lucky, I can see the call as perhaps the 3rd notification. I looked for one-touch answering under ""Accessibility"" and--surprise! NOT included.Worse, though? TWICE now, in the middle of an emergency, this phone has LOST CONNECTION TO ITS SIM CARD. No bars -- just a black triangle with an X on it. While I can text, I can neither make nor receive calls until, for some unknown reason, it fixes itself. The first time this happened, research showed me that a ""quirk"" of the 4a is that if you put it into airplane mode, it may not recognize your efforts to dismiss airplane mode. That took me two hours to find out. The second time? Neither the ""airplane mode"" nor the ""reboot"" fix worked.I never found out what was wrong, because I was too busy texting nurses and family members and driving across town in emergency mode WITHOUT A WORKING PHONE.So no. No, I do not recommend this phone. I wish I had never bought it.",2021年9月8日 在美国审核

It really is a workhorse that can keep up with the big boys until it's Achilles heel is exposed....build quality.I purchased a Crave protective case when I bought the phone. It was on the phone right after the 4a was unboxed and never removed. On the 5th day of ownership it slipped out of my hand, falling less than 3 feet to the ground (driveway). I picked up the phone, placed my finger on the reader and was shocked to see that the impact had cracked the screen!

I don't like that you can't assign different notifications sounds or ringtones to different contacts. There's also no notification light. Speed is good and so is the camera. However the screen was cracked within two weeks. Other phones I've had have taken far more abuse and never cracked. This was a drop of about 1 foot. It was in a case. You could blame the case for not being very protective. But what really bothers me is that it can't be repaired.

Value phone,"This phone is really good for what you are paying for. I love the size of this phone and the design. Performance is good too with most apps. But there are some disadvantages with this phone. First: Video calls, I use facebook messenger a lot for video calls, this phone gets extremely hot during video calls and cant even handle it for an hour. No Miracast protocol which means you cannot cast/screen mirror your phone to Roku/Smart TVs without their stupid device chromecast. Google disabled this feature for business purposes to sell chromecast, even though you can still hack your phone to do this, does not worth it. Otherwise this phone is good, charges fast, runs great, fingerprint great, great colors and display, good camera, I am giving 4 star to this phone because they made ""Apple move"" by disabling my favorite feature on this phone.

Brand New Phone Damaged / Poor Quality Control,"Had high hopes for this phone, unsure if I trust 5g so I wanted to get a new 4g phone while I still could get one.I've been trying to buy ""pure"" android phones since the operating system launched.I have the original pixel and absolutely love it, perfect size, great camera and it's fast (to me at least).So, I thought I would continue in the product line when my original pixel gave me a few signs that it could be reaching the end of its time.I waited longer than I should have with the current state of the world.All of a sudden no one (not Google, ""Bullseye"" or ""blue shirts"") had the Pixel 4a in stock.The only way I could order this phone (in Black) on Amazon was to buy it in a ""bundle"" with a Google Fi sim card that I did NOT need for an extra $10.00!To my disappointment when the phone arrive it had imperfections on the back of it around the camera, like something was in the mold.I paid FULL RETAIL for this phone and they are not cheap!!!

Perfect for the daily picture taker with a little social media on the side,It's a 350$ unlocked smart phone.

Charger seems fairly quick at roughly 45 min to go from high teens to the 80% range.Bought two phones and had one black screen of death after 3 days of use.

Strange Issues,"I am not a smart phone afficionado, but I am not technically illiterate.The Pixel 4a is strangely glitchy.I am on my second one after my cat sent the first plummeting to its death facedown on a tile floor, and both of my Pixels have had issues.The phone is affordable and the camera is decent.I frequently use the voice-to-text feature, but it does not work very well and frequently makes errors.(Strangely, when I used it whilst brushing my teeth, it was perfect.Riddle me that.)Despite frequent texting, it does not seem to have learned any of my preferences and autocorrects things that I do not want changed.When I try to give it verbal commands starting with, ""Okay, Google,"" it only seldom responds.The phone has sometimes unlocked itself whilst in my pocket and I cannot explain how, as a pin is required.I will hear the sound of buttons being pressed on the phone, pull it out of my pocket, and find the phone deep in my settings or in the middle of a nonsensical text.This phone also randomly deletes addresses from my contacts list.The phone numbers are intact, but any other information listed under a contact disappears.I know I saved it properly because I will use the navigation system to go to a house, but when I try to pull it up a couple months later, it is gone.My first Pixel 4a would have an issue where the screen would take on a very yellow hue.I thought it was an issue with the settings, but no amount of fiddling could make it stop.Turning the phone off and on again would work...after a while.Once being turned on again, the screen would still be yellow, and then after a few minutes would revert to the normal setting.Then one day, it got stuck on yellow and stayed that way for a month.I have no idea if there was a fix to be had, for my cat broke it and I got another.So why did I buy another with all these issues?It is affordable and I was in a hectic situation and wanted my information to transfer easily from phone to phone.I was able to get another one of these the same day the first one broke.Sadly, the information DID NOT completely transfer from the first Pixel 4a to the second.As far as durability, the first Pixel 4a was in a protective case with protective glass on the screen and survived many tumbles to the ground in its time, surviving both asphalt and concrete.A four-foot plunge facedown onto a tile floor, however, was its undoing.The screen remained intact, but something internally was damaged and the screen would no longer display, though I could hear from the alerts that the software was still working.All in all, I think Google has a lot more work to do on the Pixels if mine are any indication.I do like the price point, the display, the sound, call quality, and the photo quality is fine for my needs.Just write down your contacts addresses somewhere else so you don't lose them.",2021年12月5日 在美国审核

Great phone for those who want a compact device,"I purchased the phone based on online reviews by pundits and users. The camera was rated great - check, all day battery life - check, great screen - check, Android without the bloatware - check. Everything was great except it didn't fit my big hands. It felt awkward and too small for me to hold until I received the phone case I ordered later than the phone purchase. Adding the phone case made holding the phone acceptable, however, there was still one thing I missed that I had on my last phone and that is a larger screen. I'm 60 and now need to use reading glasses so a larger screen on my aging eyes is a definite must for me.If you have smaller hands and don't mind a small screen this is a great device. And if you have big hands then it may not fit for you. My suggestion is to go to the store and hold a Pixel a4 or a phone the same size to see if it feels okay in your hand. If it fits then you can't go wrong with this phone.With that said I am sad to say that I returned it for a Samsung A71 which has a much larger screen and is rated great also.",2021年3月23日 在美国审核

Perfect...when it works!,"The Google Pixel 4a provides the absolute best Android experience, for the cheapest price. Hands down! That cannot be contested. From the software updates (I installed Android 12 yesterday), to the features, to the camera, to the size, display, audio quality...everything. The biggest con might be the processor; it's not the fastest, most buttery experience out there, but by no means is it unstable or frustrating (with the stock Android launcher).But, there is a huge glaring problem with this phone, and it is the screen - and I believe it is a software issue. It is not a common issue, but it affects enough people (myself included) for it to not be ignored. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Google is doing; ignoring this issue.Approximately 3 months after purchasing this phone, an update rendered the screen extremy buggy, making it almost unusable. I mean, I can use it with some trickery here and there, but it is a very frustrating, unreliable experience. After the update, I got 3 dead zones on my screen - two the bottom half, and one at the very top. I can no longer swipe down pull-down the notification tray; I have to turn the phone to landscape or use the fingerprint sensor. Typing is a nightmare, and selecting ""Ok"" and ""Cancel"", and ""Not Now"" prompts are almost impossible. It takes dozens of presses and hoping my finger somehow lands on a miniscule part of the screen that recognises it. Filling it forms? Forget it. Emails? It's quicker to boot up my PC, type it out and send it from there, than using this frustating nightmare of a phone. In fact, just trying to write this review is a pain in the butt - I accidentally hit ""Submit"" four times already, at various points in writing this. And I am absolutely certain this is a software issue, as there are times where it works for brief moments (a few seconds or minutes if I'm lucky) before it reverts to this nightmare. Another reason why I know it's a software issue is if I slide my hands over those dead zones quickly enough, the input registers. It's not a fix though, as tapping them is still near impossible.And what is Google doing about it? Absolutely nothing! You should go to Google's support forum - hundreds, upon hundreds of complaints about this issue and the pinch-to-zoom or multi-touch not working - and all Google does, is have their volunteer users suggest factory resets, toggling on/off high-sensitivity mode, booting into safe mode, wait for another update, restarting the phone, or removing the screen protector. How successful were these suggestions? I bought this phone late 2019. A March 2020 update caused the problem. I've tried all of these things, repeatedly, for months on end, and have updated my phone with every update...recently updating to Android 12, AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS!I really, really, really want to love this phone. I sort of do; it nails everything for me. But this freaking screen issue is driving me crazy! I feel like I've wasted my money with this phone. I can't even, in good conscience, sell it to anyone. I love some of the Android features exclusive to Pixels, and I really want to purchase the Pixel 6, but I cannot afford it right now. The 4a is what I can afford, but I'm scared to purchase this phone again, with the possibility that I can end up with the same exact problem, and absolutely no care or support from Google.Be warned; this phone is excellent...but only if it works as intended. Good luck.*This is my 6th attempt to write this review. And what should have taken me 3 mins, took 15 :(",2021年10月22日 在美国审核

The panorama mode sucks majorly :/,"Cons: - The Panorama mode is terrible. You can't go up and down, to take a photo of a tall tree, for example.- You cannot do a side scrolling panorama, for example, take a photo of a long shelf to see everything along the length of it. You MUST stay still and tilt for it to attempt a photo - The phone lags and glitches often when deleting a photo or switching from camera mode to video mode- Google Photos is the only app that comes installed for viewing/managing photos; there is no other image galleryAlso - Google just updated app icons so they all look similar to each other and very different from what they were, making everything Google less accessible, more difficult to find. No settings to change app icons back to old version. No setting to change the battery icon to say percentage - hard to read the tiny battery symbolPros -- regular camera is fine, night mode is cool I guess- not having bloat ware, having control over what apps I have or don't have is nice.

Think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a,"Hello Reader,First of all, I would like to clarify one thing, I bought Google Pixel 4a for one reason and one reason only, which is:To flash and try GrapheneOS and CalyxOS on Google Pixel 4aSo, If you are looking for any Android phone, please think twice before buying Google Pixel 4a.I placed the order on ""Feb 4th 2021"", and I received it on ""Feb 7th 2021"", I live in Bahrain and the phone sold by""Triplenet Pricing INC"" in USA, That was really impressive to get the phone in just two days.Pros:1- Very good speaker sound, for a small phone.2- good screen resolution and touch.3- good reception for carrier signal.4- Only Google Apps installed by default.5- ironically, Google Pixel devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards, that is why it's supported by GraphenOS and CalyxOSCons:1- I consider it expensive for its HW specs, there are other good brands in the market with higher specs with same or less price with really good feel and touch and good chassis, for example: OnePlus 7.2- the phone edges have air pockets, you feel it and hear sound when you softly press on the edges, the body is polycarbonate unibody, what do you expect.3- Forget to use the phone without an armor case and screen protector, you will lose it very quickly if you did not. Conclusion:If you are just looking for an android phone and you do not care about the brand, think twice before you buy Google Pixel 4a, you can find a better phone with same or lees price.Buy Google Pixel 4a only if you really want to, and you have your own reasons to do that, as I do.",2021年2月23日 在美国审核

Great phone for young eyes - it's small!,"I'd never seen one in person and I didn't realize how small it is! It's a good phone if you're under 40, but if not, you should know the text on the screen can be very small. Meaning 4 point font size or even smaller. You can make the font size bigger but that messes up some layouts and makes some text become way too big. If you can read tiny text you're good to go.

Worst Customer Friendly Phone Ever Owned,"Phone for personaluse. Absolutely not user friendly, compared to LG phone I had previously. This is a ""typical"" Google ""nerd"" phone that is designed for techies, not for ""normal"" older users. Camera is great I guess--use it about once every month--I have cameras.Batteryand charging are excellent. Non-standard USB cord provided--need to buy others for car,etc.Big problem has been phone never rings, or when it does, it impossible to ""swipe"" to open. Bad notifications (none) Never know when messages or voice mail is received--have to manually check.Google continually send automatic notices and pop-ups to sell more products--can't turn off. When you turn off one function, it will normally turn OFF others, e.g., sound, so you never get notices of calls.Biggest advantage is that it is a smaller phone, 5+ by 2+ inches, easier to carrythan the nerd 7"" X 3"" monsters.I bought it partly for blue-tooth connectivity, which is OK. My LG was 100% more user friendly.I had bought the Apple LS, but it died within a week, so I went back to Android--Big Mistake. Now have to eat $500 to change, LG does not make the small phone anymore.No one does it seems. My phone hone is used primarily for calls. Do not need an additional pre-installed 45 google apps on the phone that lacksbasic functionality.

Updates From Google Caused Bluetooth Issues in Car,"I've had my Pixel 4A for a little over a year. It's a bit quirky at times (changes settings randomly, sometimes calls are difficult to get back to or answer as they won't show on the screen, etc.), but overall, after getting used to it, it was okay.Fast forward to now. After their Android 11 update, my phone will no longer pair with my car's blue tooth for use as a phone. It has no issue pairing for music (Spotify), but after SEVERAL online recommended fixes (there is an article on this issue, so it's not just me), calling Google, it still won't pair. Matter of fact, right after the update, if I tried to pair my phone in the car, it would turn my blue tooth off and on several times and then turn my phone off with an error message of ""corrupt files, etc. You may need to reset phone to factory settings.""Since my phone's warranty is expired by just one month (weird how that happens), Google will do NOTHING for me. Matter of fact, they told me to call You Break, We Fix, which I did. They told me that they don't repair issues like that and to call Google. Yep.I am going to call Amazon, but I'm pretty sure I'll hit another dead end.Don't waste your money on this phone. It may be cheap, but not worth the headache.",2021年12月10日 在美国审核

"Poor user experience, atrocious sound performance rendering it almost unusable in some situations","Cheap inferior phone (in all aspects) except the camera. And by cheap I mean cheap. The body and screen are decent, however, the speaker quality is so dismal I am considering to selling it. 4a is at least a decent(ish) value for money and the camera punches above its weight. I initially got Pixel 5 but had to sell it because it had very much the same issues except it cost $650. The whole experience of 4a is very imbalanced. I miss the audio quality and materials of my Samsung Galaxy S7 every minute and that is a five year old phone. The drop in quality is shocking.If you use the phone as a phone, something designers at Goggle probably don't, you'll want to hurl it through the window soon. It is practically unusable as a speaker phone which is something the competition does usually very well. The loudspeaker accentuates any minor issues participants may have with their lines: the one that is a tad too bassy buzzes and sounds hollow, faint lines sound fainter etc. Samsung figured this out years back!Similarly, you will almost never be able to set the loudness level correctly between ringtones, alarms, media volumes between loudspeaker use and headphone use. Imagine you set your ringtone so that you can hear it in normal use. Then you switch to headphones to play a song. Then someone calls you. Your eardrums will almost explode because the phone is too dumb to adjust for headphones!Perhaps I am too focussed on the audio quality. But for me it is a key function. There is a lot of hype about Google products but substance is simply not there. Google sells you cheap iron designed by a team who really do not know how to make it work together. And a good camera. However, the competition caught up with the latter as well. I am still considering selling this phone too. Not happy.",2021年1月26日 在美国审核

DON'T BUY - amazing phone ... THAT WILL BREAK!!!,"I love Google products. I'm not exaggerating when I say I use them all, both for personal use and as a teacher and scout leader. I bought my first Google Pixel 4a last Sept. 2020. By April 2020 the sensor fingerprint button on the back had broken, I had spent some time on the phone with Google tech troubleshooting the issue, had a major problem with a factory reset (which did not fix the problem). THEN, before getting it into the store, a tiny break on the screen occurred (regular drop, using a case....first time this has ever occurred to me in my entire lifetime of smartphone use, always using the case). When I got it to the store, they wouldn't fix it. They said I would have to pay for both fixes out of pocket...the cost of a new phone. They would not accept the email from Google saying that they would fix the manufacturing issue and let me pay for the other part (the broken screen). I let Google know the response via email and got a total non-response response that did not respond to the problem at all. Then the screen cracked more. Out of time and need a new phone that actually workes for an upcoming trip, I decided to spend the $300 on a new phone so I'd be under warranty for a year. My cell carrier didn't have any Pixel 4a online or in-store, so I bought one on Amazon brand new and it arrived that same day. I'm not joking ... less than 12 hours later, with a case, the brand new phone dropped again ... and broke, worse than the prior phone!! Specs say this is Grorilla Glass 3...that was one of the reasons I bought this phone and a case. I KNOW I'm going to have occasional drops. But this drop was in a case, from 2 feet onto a linoleum style floor. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BROKEN. That's two phones ... one after 7 months use, one after 12 hours. I've never had a phone that worked so well but with such terrible manufacturing that it breaks so much so often. The worst part is that all I have after multiple emails and now two long phone calls with Google is a promise that if I go back to the contractor Fixit store with the FIRST phone they will back the warranty on the button that broke .... so hey, I can pay $149 bucks to fix the broken phone and I'll be back to ONE working phone again, after spending nearly $800 dollars in one year on two brand new Pixel4as ...

Reception is average (better would be nice). It has the headphone jack but the sound quality is like, why bother, compared my LG V20.

Volume button and screen sensor issues,"I can press the down volume button, but the up volume doesn't work most of the time.

Blurry and grainy video calls when using front facing camera,"Video call imagery is awful when using the front facing camera. Worse than my three year old Motorola phone. The video calls are pixelated and looks washed out. It is distracting how fuzzy it looks. I'm shocked that none of the reviews that I read prior to buying the phone mentions this. I did a quick search and tons of people have had this issue. The camera itself is fine and clear when taking photos so this leads me to think it's a software issue. I tried video calls using the built in calling app, Duo, Google Hangouts, Signal, Jitsi, and Line, all were the same blurry mess. The only app where video call was clear for me was Facebook Messenger.Guidance by support is to clean camera lens and factory reset the phone...the brand new phone I got a few days ago. Now I'm in situation where I'm determining if I should return and buy another phone or stick to pixel 4a and put up with video calls that looks like I'm using a digital camera from 10 years ago.",2021年4月6日 在美国审核

Glitchy and buttons do not work.,"After just a couple months of use, the side power button stopped working. Now, five months into use, the side volume buttons do not work either.

The side buttons continued to not work with increasing regularity. I had to ensure that the phone never died, because I could not turn it back on if it did. It recently died on a backpacking trip, and I couldn't get it to turn on when I really needed it to find EV charging stations. It was extremely frustrating and I finally traded it in while completely fed up. The non-functional side buttons also caused me to regularly pocket-dial people since I couldn't turn the screen off. The phone also heated up super easily.I'm bummed that the phone did not work out.

What a headache,"The phone was great for a few months then it started having issues with the screen.The top part of the screen would not allow me to press it so that it would move to a different screen on an app or anything that was in that vacinity. I called google for help, they wanted me to take the phone to the closest repair location, 135 miles away in San Antonio, TX.I could not take it right away, it took me 3 weeks to finally take the phone to their location Youbreakitwefixit.Well by the time I took it, I had an accident with my phone and the screen was damaged.Well when I took it in, I explained to them that the screen had issues before the screen was damaged.I admitted that I damaged the screen, try convincing them that the issue was before the damage.No chance, they said they could not mess with it and that the charge for my screen change was $150.I was 135 miles away, no choice but to change it, trying to get intouch with google is impossible.So they changed the screen, I paid what I had to, guess what 3 days later the screen got a green cloud started on top part of the phone.I told the Youbreakitwefix manager to take a look at it, he saw it and said that they would replace it, I would have to leave it.I could not, I had to come back to my hometown, 135 miles away.I told him I would return the next day, drive another 135 miles, I could not because of my work.I came back 5 days later and my phone was dead, the screen black.So I called and asked if the phone was still covered and if I could return it to get fixed based on me having the manager look it over and seeing that it was nothing I had done.They said yes to bring it, I get there they look over the phone and they say it had a hair line crack, small one at the corner.I told them I had not seen anything and the employee had reviewed it and nothing was broken.But I knew I was going to lose because I had returned 5 days later and they would assume I damaged it.Anyway I called the regional manager pled my case and got 50% off the next change of screen.Well again I had paid already over $225 for two screen changes in week.I get back to home town and use it for 2 weeks buying the best screen protector and phone case.Well guess what again the issue happens the green cloud forms on the phone, top part.I can't believe it!!!So I contact the Youbreakitwefixit regional manager, I try contacting Google again all to a frustrating no success.So a local phone repair shop said it sounds like there is something that is left on that edge of the phone underneath, a glass a piece of something and when the screen is put on and I use it or leave it my pocket even with the screen protector and cover it damages the screen.He saw myphone it had no damage to the screen none to the body, nothing.He said he could replace it for $180 including labor.This is too much of a headache.!!!!Do not deal with Google, and buy the protection when you purchase this phone!!!",2021年11月28日 在美国审核

"Compact size, quality build, BAD CHOICE FOR TRAVELERS OR EXPATS","--UPDATE AFTER TALKING WITH GOOGLE SUPPORT---NEVER buy a Google Pixel phone if you plan to travel, work or live outside the US. It's way too common with mobile phones that there can be problems with the screen or a battery, either from manufacturer error or user error or because mobile phone batteries have a limited lifespan. Google Pixels are way too rarely used worldwide, so outside the US they are difficult or impossible to be repaired. Talking with Google Support, the only option is to pay myself to mail it back to the US, with mail time and repair time that would take at least 4-6 weeks. During which point I'd need to buy another phone to use in the meantime; or, at all times you have to purchase TWO Google Pixel phones in the event that you have a problem with one because they're too difficult to have repaired most anywhere outside the US, so that's a problem if you work, live or travel outside the US. If you plan to live or travel outside the US. Buy a Samsung or Apple instead.---UPDATE 6 MONTHS LATER ---The phone was a nice phone, but the battery stopped charging after 6 months. I didn't drop in water, it's not damaged, but it stopped charging so then it's worthless. I followed all of the troubleshooting steps but it still won't work. Another problem is I live and work overseas, so it's not feasible to send this to a Google official repair place (none nearby), that would require 4-6 weeks at least. I went to a local phone repair tech near me, they said the USB port looks fine but it won't charge. Now to even get a replacement battery, that will take 3-4 weeks.Tip for those who travel: Don't use the Google Pixel. It's a decent phone, but if there's a problem, it's so hard to repair. Google Pixel's aren't used widely enough worldwide to be able to repair them anywhere. For that, a Samsung or Apple phone would be better. If your battery goes bad (which happens in phones) or you crack your screen (also a common occurrence) and you live or travel a lot, these are very troublesome and even impossible to get serviced or repaired.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW ---Good quality build and functions for a mid-range phone. The Pixel 4a is a little smaller overall than the 3a. The screen is about the same, but it extends to the full edge of the phone to achieve a similar screen size. But to do this, the corners of the screen are completely rounded, which I don't prefer as much, and the front camera lens is inside the screen, which hasn't been that big of a deal. The only problem so far is the phone froze during an incoming call and couldn't be answered, phone had to be restarted. Battery life seems ok, but have to purposefully limit what the phone automatically accesses to limit use and extend battery.",2021年5月16日 在美国审核

Not their best product,I purchased this phone around a year ago and it I have had to have it replaced by Google twice now. I've had a cell for over 20 years now and this is the first phone i have ever owned that needed to be replaced in the first year. First after a few months the phone would not recognize any SIM card. Google asked me to bring it to an ubreakifix store a half hour away who verified the issue within minutes. But Google rejected the fix as being too expensive so they required me to send the phone back to them and sent me a refurbished replacement. Then a few months later the phone stopped charging all together. And I had to send it back to them again for another refurb. This is my 4th Google branded phone and the first one with any issues. So their quality control on this product just seems to be lacking. Now it is no longer under warranty and i have no confidence that it'll actually keep working properly.,2021年9月19日 在美国审核

Here are two examples: the search box on the home screen could not be moved (or removed) and the app screen did not have the capability of creating folders. So if you want to group apps together (like all of the Google apps), you need to create shortcuts and create a folder for them on your home screen. This still leaves the app screen cluttered and disorganized.If you are upgrading from an earlier version of the Pixel, then you will probably like this phone.

A user can't read the message and then mark a new number as spam.The swipe commands (back, home, etc) conflict with homepage navigation.There's no way to mute a conversation in Messages other than blocking the senders.The phone has many annoyances like that and very few optoins to correct them.

95% Perfect!,"I bought mine through Google and I have a serious addiction to smartphones. I currently have a Mate 10 Pro, Pixel 3a, Galaxy S10e, S20 5G, Note 20 and a Pixel 4a.The S10e has been my all time favorite and the 4a might end up taking the top spot.Positives for me:*Price: $350 for a phone that meets or beats phones costing over twice as much. The 4a is a steal at this price!*Polycarbonate build with matte finish. Whomever thought putting glass on the back of a phone was a good idea must have a sedentary life style. What a dumb idea. ""Oh, but glass feels preeemium"". Give me a FB.*Light weight: I spend most of the warm months in shorts and I hate having a heavy phone weighing my pocket down.*Beautiful 1080p screen with smooth &amp; fast scrolling, but wish it was 6.0"" to 6.2"".People go on and on about QHD displays and 120Hz which is great, but these are cell phones people not TV screens. I don't care what make phone you have, if you keep your screen on the highest resolution and set to 120Hz your battery will drain at a rapid pace. Add in 5G and you better have a desk job with a plug near by. Cell phone battery technology is not ready for these options and I know because I have had several phones with all three options and they take a lot of juice.*Rear finger print sensor: IMO this is the best way to unlock a phone and the perfect location and the speed of it is perfect. Actually I like the side mounted FP sensor on the S10e a little better and I don't understand why all manufacturers don't use it or a rear mount.*Battery life is excellent and it charges fast enough. These 40w+ chargers some phones use will dramatically shorten battery life, but they do give you the all important bragging rights. I have had over 8 hours SOT on my 4a with brightness set to auto.*128gb of storage is great and should be more than enough for 90% of the users. 6gb of ram is perfect and makes this phone as quick as phones costing twice as much and more.*Headphone Jack: I haven't used one in over 6 years, but a lot of people do.*Haptics: Pixels have the best haptics and weak rattly haptics can ruin the feel of a phone, but not this one.*Stereo Speakers: They sound very good and sound amazing for the price. Plenty loud.Negatives:None, other than a slightly larger screen would have been nice, but is by no means a deal breaker.",2020年8月29日 在美国审核
Can't Be Beat At $350,"I've been an iphone user forever. I always get the newest iphone every year, but have dabbled in android phones a handful of times, the last being the exploding Note phone by Samsung. Lately I've felt utterly bored by iOS and apple in general. Every iteration feels like the same thing over and over for more and more money. I started questioning whether I truly needed a $1,000 cell phone, especially a brand new one every year. I feel that flagship phones are at a point of diminishing returns. I don't game on my cell phones much, and there's nothing I'm doing that needs $1k worth of hardware to accomplish. Youtube, texting, internet browsing, occasional Twitter use makes up the majority of my consumption. I started browsing what current android phones are offering once I made the decision that I was going to leave Apple and ios behind. First I looked at Samsung, but quickly realized that they are essentially the Android version of Apple, very expensive and flashy, but not offering simplicity. After some more browsing of Sony, motorola, oneplus etc, I came upon the Google Pixel line. Pixels are not flashy, they don't fold in half, they don't have super ultra extreme warp charging. What they offer is a simply attractive phone, with unalulterated, bloatware-free Android OS, monthly security updates, day one major android updates, regular ""feature drops"" and, for the Pixel 4a anyway, awesome battery life. The 4a is a no-frills, budget phone that punches way above it's price tag, and performs unlike what I thought a ""budget"" phone would feel like. I very much enjoy having a fingerprint reader again, and the headphone jack is a pleasant addition, though I don't use it much it's nice to know it's there if I need it. 5g isn't and won't be available in my rural new england area likely for years, so it's nice to not pay extra for a feature I'll never miss.Simply put, this is THE phone to get if you want an inexpensive but strong-performing experience. For $350, this phone cannot be beat.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核
"Ah, how I missed the Pixel camera! Otherwise, awesome phone","The time of the $1000 phones for bells and whistles may have ended in 2020. Hey, we needed SOMETHING to go right. I use a OnePlus 8 as my daily driver and was excited to try this Pixel 4a out. I knew that it had rave reviews for the camera and it absolutely blows my OnePlus 8 out of the water.Otherwise, the device runs smoothly for most tasks. I am used to the 90hz screen, so the 60hz is definitely noticeable on the Pixel 4a. However if you have never had a phone with 90hz or don't have a clue what I am talking about, you won't notice a thing with the Pixel 4a. :)Other great features include the size. Yes, I have a 6"" plus phone and I absolutely LOVE this smaller sized Pixel. So easy to carry and to use. I also love the fingerprint reader. It works super welland is accurate probably 95% of the time...even more possibly.What's not to like? I am not a big fan of the plastic feel, but that is to be expected with a device at this price point. I am also not big on the real life battery life. It was great for the first week of just using as a camera, but it started to even out with my OnePlus, but with much less usage than the other. It does have relatively fast charging though, so there's that.All in all, for the money you're not going to find a much better device yet. There are things coming that may meet or exceed this, but for the moment I am a strong believer in the Pixel 4a.",2020年10月7日 在美国审核
The only good budget android phone that isn't giant.,"I use my smartphones for very basic purposes: phone calls (shocking I know), texting, taking photos, music and podcasts, reading email, and a little web browsing.I am tired of how huge android phones are becoming.I previously had a moto G5 plus, and that was the largest I ever wanted my phone to be.I want to be able to use my phone one handed and I want it to completely fit in my pockets.The pixel a line is the only option of budget android phones that are reasonably sized.Every other budget option from other companies is now 6.5+ inch screens.I don't want that big a phone.Currently, if you want a good midrange device that isn't giant, this is the ONLY option.I even put a case on this thing and it's still slightly smaller than my previous Moto G5 plus.And fortunately, Google has done a great job with the phone.As mentioned above, I'm not a power user, so I can't comment on pushing the phone to its limits, but so far, its plenty fast, has an amazing screen, can be used with one hand, and fits in my hand and pockets.It does everything I want it to, and because its a google phone, isn't bogged down by unwanted bloatware.",2020年9月7日 在美国审核
Great Features for Reasonable Price,"At this price point, the Google Pixel 4a is almost perfect.Coming from a flagship user I was definitely skeptical about the 4a, that is, until I had it running and in my hands. Here's some key points:Screen: Very clean gorilla glass 3 - almost edge to edge display along with the hole-punch camera. The camera hole is a bit bigger than the others, but again for the price, it's easily forgivable. The screen is very crisp for 1080p, it's just lacking brightness. There isn't fast refresh available, but it doesn't bother me.Body: The body is plastic, which is fine because it feels nice, fingerprints can't be seen and it should be more durable than glass. The only thing I see being different than what I'm used to is the weight of this device, its so light it feels like it disappears in your pocket but almost feels too light in the hands. Not bad just not what I'm used to. The back of the phone is where the fingerprint scanner is located and its very fast in my experience.Cameras: Only a single camera module in the rear which is expected for the price. This camera is surprisingly good, great detail, auto focus, portraits and videos. Front module is not as impressive, but certainly usable.Chipset: This device has a Snapdragon730 paired with 6gb of RAM and it's really snappy. I'm not sure if it's a lack of bloatware, but transitioning between apps was smooth and made it feel like more of a premium phone. Storage for this device is fixed at 128gb with no expansion available.Battery: Is a 3140mah Li-po unit that lasted an entire day for me and I consider myself a heavy user. Charging is available at 18w which is nice for charging to 100% in about 1.5hrs. This phone offers reverse charging via USB, but I never used this feature. It does not support wireless charging but that's OK because I'm sure it keeps the price down and I don't use wireless charging all the time.Overall I'm quite impressed by this little, but powerful device. It's a perfect phone for someone getting into smartphones or someone who doesn't want to break the bank replacing an old phone. The only con I saw using this device was the sound quality; Anything above 50-60% and the body vibrates a lot and the sound quality just isn't great. Other than that I would highly recommend the Google Pixel 4a.",2020年11月15日 在美国审核
A great upgrade for reluctant tech folks like us,"First things first, we're not tech geeks by any stretch of the imagination. My wife had been using an older phone that didn't have much memory and was something of a dinosaur in today's world. When this became available, we picked it up, even if somewhat reluctant. For us, it's been a really smooth transition.As with most gadgets, learning is fairly intuitive and trial-and-error. Set up was easy to link her older android phone to this one. We've never had a Google Pixel phone before and, truth be told, never even heard of them before. Again, for us, the set up was easy (a huge plus), and figuring out how to swipe, use various shortcuts, and essentially learn the phone was a pleasant and rarely frustrating experience. I can't tell you how important that is for us. The photographs, as advertised, are very sharp and as good as promised. I'll skip the concept of a phone being a great camera, but for us, especially given her old phone (and my iPhone 6s), these are really nice photos.The essentials - the battery life is great and it's a quick charge (as is the case with most new phones), we don't do facial recognition, and the dimensions are good for her hands. We quickly picked up a case with screen covers, which eased our worries about drops or damages. Since we've had it, we've been really surprised and happy with how easy it is to work with, how much of an upgrade it is, and how easy it's been for her to acclimate to. That last thing is the most important, and for the very reasonable price, that makes this upgrade a really nice one.",2020年10月26日 在美国审核
"Love It, Lightweight, No Bloat, Fast, Battery Life A+","Ive used more flagship brand phones then I can remember, my most recent was IPhone but I grew tired of the lack of customization and being force fed apps I didn't want (on Android phones also). I wanted a lighter weight phone, one that got right to the point with apps, one I didn't have to be so worried about smothering in a case and tempered glass. A phone that had great battery life, easy interface, fit in my pocket, good camera, and would be updated as needed unlike most flagships that only update after long waits and those end ubruptly. A phone that has an easy bootloader unlock such as the Pixel 4a can be used years and has the e-sim feature.The Pixel 4a ticked all my boxes on the list. I've got a few spare phones and found myself switching between them for many reasons, and grew tired of this. I had the opportunity to try out a Pixel 4a and was impressed with it's functionality, friendly clean user interface. While many complain about a plastic feel, I would not call it that. I purchased the almost blue colored 4a and it does not feel plastic it is a satin matte finish. The advantage to it's construction is it is light, a pleasant one-hand experience, the display is beautiful and tough Gorilla glass, holding the phone it's not slipper but more if a matte. The speed is wonderful with it's generous ram, 128g storage, rear fingerprint is quick and snappy. I'm a minimalist but have added apps and a couple heavy duty games that it has no problem running. The battery gets me a whole day, and the phone fast charges.The only thing I think is lacking is the speaker volume for calls. Most of my calls I use on speaker and it may be just aging me but it's never quite loud enough. Music, movies, gaming, all sound fine on speaker but calls not so much, I find myself looking to turn the volume up all the way. That's about all. Headphones and earbuds rectify the problem but on its own yes in calls on speaker seem a bit quiet.The price point is a win. If your not sure you want a Pixel 4a do as I did and go to a store and check one out, it sealed the deal for me. If you like simple, user friendly, pure stock user friendly Android and a phone that won't make your hands ache due to size and weight, another win. The phone is well made, it's features are in fact wonderful minus extra bells and whistles of phones now costing over 1k that only update 3-4 years and degrade. There is no wireless charging, I prefer wired, the NFC works great, the top headphone jack a plus as most companies have removed it.Be aware that your phone provider's sim card once in the phone, such as Verizon, AT&amp;T, ect, will auto install their Bloat apps once you restart the phone, this is NOT Google doing it! After experiencing it I opted to switch to Google Fi as I am a light data user and normally on WIFI, and FI uses both ""e-sim"" and physical sim. This is the best feature for me, no more messing with sim chips that degrade over time. We travel outside the USA to UK and can use our number android e-sim but can also use a local UK physical sim inserted in the phone at the same time. T-Mobile sim service does not install all the bloat AT&amp;T and Verizon sims do.Tip: Purchase from Google Store or Fi directly. Not 3rd party sellers or the big wireless companies, this way you get no pre-added apps or branding.",2021年7月16日 在美国审核
"Awesome phone, great value for money, good battery life, great photos, highly recommended ...","Disclaimer: The below opinion on this phone considers the fact that this is a budget device.Love this phone - that's the gist of below review.For the price, the value for money it provides is really unparalleled.There's nothing better you can get in this price range in the market.Anyone who wants to spend less and wants a great phone, this is what you should buy.WHATS IN THE BOXPhone, Charging brick and cable, USB to USB type C adapter, SIM ejection tool and some paperworkMY THOUGHTSIt cannot be compared to the mighty expensive phones - the iPhones and the high end Galaxy S phones.They are more than double or triple the price of this phone but do provide double or triple features as compared to this phone?The answer is NO.Let me elaborate.CAMERA: Writing about Camera first as that's the most striking feature about this phone.In one word, the camera is awesome and super convenient.It is arguably the best phone camera for still photography in the world. Pictures are crisp and clear, with great detail, vivid colors which are very close to being natural and great dynamic range.Also must add that the camera so is super easy to use.I love it for it's simplicity. You can pull it out and start clicking photos rightaway.It has fast focus which makes it a great point and shoot device. And what about night photography, it's just awesome, even in the lowest of light, it can capture great detail. The photos aren't grainy at all.A couple of photos of my kitchen garden are attached as a sample, taken in pitch darkness. It also has an astrophotography mode but yet to use it.The front facing camera is also great.The picture quality is excellent and the bokeh effect also works very well for portrait shots.In fact would say that this phone captures perhaps the best bokeh shots without using a telephoto lens. Both the back and the front camera are excellent in this regardSOFTWARE: it is pure Android.Out of the box, it came with Android 10. And just this morning when I checked, Android 11 was available for download.Which phone company will give you latest software updates so regularly (except Apple).Plus google has promised to provide software updates for at least 3 years for all their devices.Samsung announced very recently that they would support their devices for 3 years with software updates but we all know that the updates will be slow to come by. At the end of it, there's nothing better than pure Android.BATTERY LIFE &amp; CHARGING SPEED: In my observation, the battery life is quite good and easily lasts me a day of normal use.Some observations attached in pictures.There are two ways in which the battery life was observed - one without power saving option on (you can toggle it via the pull down menu) and one with the power saving option on.Without the power saving option, got the phone to last more than a day with almost 5 hours of screen on time. The ambient display was on and that took quite a bit of battery so you'd have to be careful with that. There's also the always on display but it will certainly hog battery life.With the power saving option on, got the phone to last a little less than 2 days with 5 hours on screen on time. This is great.I am sure that with Android 11 now coming, the battery life will only improve even more.The advertised battery capacity is 3140 mAh.The box includes a wall charger which is 18W.It's not as fast as some of the other premium phones but good enough for me.I wish wireless charging was present even at a slower speed but not a big deal.BUILD QUALITY: yes the back of the phone is plastic butstill it is sleek and has a very decent build for the price. The weight is nicely and evenly distributed and it doesn't feel cheap at all. It quite light actually which is good as well.It doesn't feel as premium as a glass back phone but still very close.In any case, most people would put a cover on this so who cares if it's plastic or a glass back.Also, plastic provides better durability as glass is more prone to cracking. You can actually use it without the case but with an edge to edge glass screen protector.HEADPHONE JACK: Yes, there's a headphone jack at the top of the phone.And its a moment to rejoice as most of the known brands these days don't have a headphone jack. To me it is super convenient as all my wired headsets work so well with this.With other phones either have to use an Adapter or a blue tooth device which is also ok but nothing replaces a 3.5 mm headphone jack. You can quickly plug in your high impedance headset and enjoy listening to music.DUAL STEREO SPEAKER SYSTEM: This is one of the features which is found mostly in more premium phones. And this phone has it.It has a speaker at the top of the phone and another one is on the edge which is bottom firing.Overall it creates a good effect when watching youtube videos.SCREEN SIZE:The screen size is 5.8 in which is small when compared to other large phones. But to be honest, its quite ok.It has a punch hole front facing camera but very good decision to keep it in the corner rather than the center. Keeping it in the corner make the view rather unobtrusive while watching videos or photos.SCREEN QUALITY: the screen is AMOLED which is always preferable over LCD panels.It has deep blacks, good contrast and viewing angles. Mind you it's not the highest quality OLED panel and you can tell it when you compare it with high end Samsung phones.But again for the price, it is quite good. It is 1080p screen which is more than enough for day to day use. One observation here is that even indoors, the phone doesn't feel bright enough,it has to be kept at 75-80% brightness to be able to use it comfortably.For Samsung phones, keeping the phones at 40-45% brightness suffices.PERFORMANCE, RAM &amp; MEMORY: The phone is powered by a mid-range snapdragon processor. It's an octacore 730G processor which is certainly not the best but more than good enough for day to day tasks of browsing the internet, news apps, watching youtube videos, playing some low end games. You can actually play some high end games as well but the performance was just about ok.The G in the processor name conveys that it provides improved graphics.But do see some frames dropping here and there while graphically intense games.But it wasn't intrusive or distracting in any way.An occasional stutter here and there does happen but largely good.The phone comes with 6 GB of RAM which is more than enough for multi-tasking and keeping the apps in memory. Storage is 128 GB which I feel is more than good enough, you don't need anything more than that to be honest as Google provides free cloud storage at optimal image quality through Google photos.What's not there: following features are not there as compared to high end phones: no water proofing or IP rating, no glass back, no wireless charging, no face unlock, no in screen fingerprint scanner (it does have a fingerprint scanner on the back and it works very well), no telephoto lens, no wide angle camera, no expandable storage via microsd card.All of these are present in more premium phones but really do you need all of these bells and whistles.Perhaps wide angle camera is the only one I miss.In summary, this phone ticks all the boxes considering its price and you just can't go wrong with it. It's a lot of phone for the price.",2020年9月19日 在美国审核
"Well built, solid phone","I purchased this phone to replace a BLU Vivo XL4 phone.I also swapped mobile providers when I left my previous employer, going to Mint Mobile from Verizon.Quick story: When I joined Mint Mobile I put their sim card into my BLU XL4 and.... zip nada, it didn't work.I could not make or receive phone call (text messages would arrive but only after an excessive delay).I initially blamed Mint Mobile for the problem.On a lark, I decided to bite the bullet and get a new phone.After several weeks of research I settled on Google's Pixel series (my previous phone provided by my employer was a Pixel 3XL (great phone)).I decided to upgrade to the newer version, Pixel 4a.After the phone arrived, I inserted the Mint Mobile sim into the Pixel 4a.I powered up the phone and fully expected to be disappointed.Instead I found that I had full service! Finally I could make calls anywhere without drops or fading and texts messages arrived instantly.Important Lesson:Cheaper is not always better.Sometimes the quality of the parts used in some lower cost phones are not always equal (receiver sensitivity, transmit power).Exception to the rule: Mint Mobile phone service.Unlimited calling and texts.4 GB data.$15/month.You read that correctly.Back to the phone.Pure Android experience.No unnecessary apps present to consume memory.Migration of phone and data was very simple and quick.Pros:+ phone contains a good processor.Speedy experience, with no lag.+ screen resolution is great.+ camera is fantastic.+ Fingerprint reader is best in class.+ Huge amount of memory (128 GB).+ Very quick battery recharge.+ Great speaker quality.+ solid phone constructionCons:-OK Battery life (Lasts about a day and a half).",2021年9月11日 在美国审核

Good and cheap,"You’d think only $800+ smartphones are worth it. Then something like the Google Pixel 4a comes along and makes you reconsider. It’s not so much because you’re getting more overall than on a pricier smartphone, but rather it’s the fact that you get a lot for the price of $350 that makes this phone stand out from the pack.<br>The Pixel 4a will tempt even users of high end smartphones to consider the minimalistic, but punchy, approach of Google with this device. It delivers in what matters and it cuts corners where it doesn’t, making us feel uncomfortable about the amounts of money we spend on flagship smartphones.The first thing that will make an impression is the size of the phone. The Pixel 4a is a small phone for 2020. You can handle it with one hand, which says a lot. But even though it’s small, it still provides 5.8 inches of screen real estate, mostly due to the very thin bezels and the punch-hole camera. The body is made of plastic and it’s in a matte black finish. This choice of materials makes the 4a very light, especially when I compare it to my daily iPhone X which feels super heavy with its glass surfaces. Even though beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I did find the back side design a bit dull, lacking any elements that would make it stand out from the crowd. But this is to be expected at this price range.On the back, you’ll find the camera-flash array in the upper left corner, and a fingerprint sensor centrally located. The latter sinks in the back panel, making it easy to find it without looking.On the left side of the phone you’ll find the SIM card tray, and on the right side there are the power and volume buttons. Google made the power button white, which is an interesting choice of color. The top includes a headphones jack (yay) and the bottom provides the USB-C charging port and two speaker holes.The screen is one of the impressive points. Google equipped the Pixel 4a with a wonderful 5.8 inches Full HD+ OLED screen, with a density of 443 ppi and an aspect ratio of 19.5:9. The screen is very bright and with nice and accurate colors. The responsiveness of swiping and gestures is great, and I didn’t notice any lag while operating the phone. It’s amazing how good this screen is, especially if you think about the price of this device.On the top left corner you’ll find the punch-hole front camera, used for front facing video and selfies. This is a great move by Google to maximize screen area and minimize the bezels around it. It also contributes in the compactness of the device overall, which could be a decisive factor for many potential buyers.What I love about this device is that is provides a decently large screen (5.8 inches) at a size that can be operated with one hand and is also very lightweight (due to the use of plastics instead of the more premium aluminum or glass). Compared to my daily iPhone X, this phone feels smaller and lighter even though the X has the same screen size. Impressive.Unlocking the phone is quite easy; grab the phone and slide your index finger over the fingerprint sensor. I will admit though, I’m too used to Apple’s facial recognition and I’m still trying to get used to this. Also, I wish Google had placed the fingerprint sensor slightly higher. My index finger keeps going higher and then lower, and also my car mount tends to cover the fingerprint sensor unless I slide the device higher when mounting it. But these are no dealbreakers by any means, especially if you think about the price tag.Things regarding performance are simple. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 730G isn’t the sharpest processor out there, but Google had no other option for a device priced at $350. Regardless, the 2.2GHz clocked CPU is perfect for average daily use and moderate power consumption. Sure, it won’t impress in gaming, but it will deliver competently in everything else.The 6GB of RAM memory help the Pixel 4a maintain consistency throughout its performance. 4GB have been proven to not be enough for modern smartphones and thankfully Google packed 6GB in the 4a. That, combined with the 128GB of storage space, will allow users to download and install multiple apps without worrying about any shortcomings.Battery autonomy is great too. With 3140 milliamps per hour, and a low powered CPU, you will most probably get more than 1.5 days of operation time before you have to recharge (provided that the average screen time is around a modest 2-2.5 hours/day).The Google Pixel 4a is equipped with a 12 MP rear camera using the IMX363 sensor, with Optical &amp; Electronic Image Stabilization (OIS + EIS). The aperture is f/1.7 and the field of view is 77 degrees. It can shoot 4K videos at 30fps or 1080p video at 60 fps. The front facing camera has an 8 MP sensor, an f/2.0 aperture and an 88 degrees field of view.The 4a shoots great pictures with nice colors and good dynamic ranges. The contrast is at a good level as well. Overall the pictures look amazing for a $350 device.I have attached some images that show the same picture shot with the Google Pixel 4a, the iPhone X and the iPhone XR. I am really happy with how the pictures from the 4a turned out.The Pixel 4a of this article is rocking the Android 10, June 2020 build. As all Google Android phones, it has a simple but very smooth and to the point GUI. Features such as Google Assistant and Call Screening are present in the 4a, as well as advanced AI functionalities that improve several aspects of the phone (for example, AI image processing of the pictures taken by the rear camera). But maybe the most important software “feature” of a Pixel phone is the guaranteed support for at least three years. That means that the Pixel 4a will be receiving Android updates at least until 2023.Overall the Google Pixel 4a is an amazing mid-level smartphone. It offers plenty of features and functionalities at the very reasonable price of $350 dollars. It excels in many areas, and it manages to mask the few deficiencies it has. The 4a is a very affordable way to experience the pure Android world with Google’s great software support. If you are in the market for an affordable but great Android smartphone, look no more.</br>",2020年9月21日 在美国审核
GREAT PHONE but...  Doesn't have the great battery life I was expecting,"I'm coming from a 2 year old pixel 3xl 128 that was giving be about 7 hours before needing a charge.Because I absolutely need all day battery life (for work), I was hoping this would fit the bill.Yeah, I know I should get the Moto G Power, but it does not have NFC for mobile payments.My results with this phone, some days it does just barely make it to 8 hours after heavy use.One day I needed to plug it in.Most of the time though, it's at 25% after my shift.I think this is a let down because after a year, this phone will be way worse the what the pixel 3xl is now.Also, some of my inventory apps are buggy and crash when using the barcode scanner, whereas the 3 never had a problem.Really no big deal, I'm sure it'll get sorted after a few updates.I gotta say, I haven't had a smallish phone in years, and this one seems great.Has a clicky power button (yeah!!) and an actual headphone jack.F.Y.II ordered a silicone case for it, but it's hasn't arrived, but I was able to find an iphone x case at the dollar store.Works great.",2020年8月27日 在美国审核
A No Frills Workhorse!,"I got this as a Christmas present for a secondary phone to use. I am an apple user and love how my brain can handle that os. I have had the OG Pixel and the 2 back in the day and loved it for the simplicity of use and sleek OS of Android. This phone reminds me of all that stuff that made me love android as a good solid OS without having bloat ware and the lack of future proofing. It’s a beautiful display for 60 hertz, one hand use is really great and the build reminds me of the Nexus 5. The camera was a pressing surprise given that I think it’s the same sensor that was on my 2. The price is really great, I just feel that when you compare Coke to Pepsi, the iPhone SE has a processor that can really run laps around most other phones. That downside is that it can ding battery life. I’m really happy with the 4a that it made me take time out of my day to review. I really think this and the 5 are solid picks. But also, I don’t need 5G just yet because it’s not a big need for me as of now. My ONLY complaint is you can’t get the google extended warranty outside of buying it from the google store. That’s where Apple wins, you can have 60 days to add that right from settings of the devices if you like to keep phones longer than a year. But that’s just me.",2020年12月23日 在美国审核
Value Priced Feature Packed Phone With An Amazing Camera,"When I dropped our old mobile phone service to move to Project Fi, new compatible phones were necessary. The Pixel2 had just come out and was my choice to replace my family’s phones. The monthly phone bill was very low compared to our old service and a year’s worth of the savings paid for our phones. After two years, we upgraded to Pixel 4XL sets. When need arose for an additional phone, I again researched available options, ultimately choosing the Pixel 4a. Admittedly, I wanted something less expensive than another 4XL, plus size appropriate for smaller hands with a good camera and no degradation in performance. The 4a has been a perfect choice. It’s smaller and easier to hold. The camera seems to be the equal of its bigger counterpart’s much acclaimed camera. Not everyone loves the feature, but I’m partial to phones with a fingerprint sensor on the back, like on the 4a. Something else I don’t see all the time on inexpensive phones is the ability to make contactless payments (NFC). Old style headphones are compatible too with the 4a’s headphone jack. At this price, it wasn’t a surprise, or very disappointing, to learn that the phone isn’t rated as water resistant. I highly recommend Google Fi phone service and Google Pixel phones. Considering the savings, compared to high-end Android phones, the 4a is an intelligent choice for anyone that wants most of the perks of the bigger sets in a less sexy package (plastic versus glass). Five stars.",2020年9月19日 在美国审核
Great phone for the money,"I've been using this phone for the better part of a year, and I still am enjoying it. Everything I consider negative about the phone I knew before buying it: no 5g, no wireless charging, no ip rating against water. But all expectations for me have been met or exceeded. I must admit I am a smaller phone lover, and got this phone after using the first gen of the Z-flip (non-5g). I really liked the Z-flip, but after using this phone the Z-flip is sitting in a drawer (that gen's external screen was just too small, next gen looks more functional).As far as durability goes, I have a basic Spigen case on it, and have accidentally dropped it from about 5 ft onto a concrete floor a few times and maybe I'm lucky, but it's come through just fine. Have dropped it a bunch of times from about 2 feet or so and no prob (getting off the couch, forgetting on my lap). I had it get slightly wet in the rain a few months back, and it didn't allow me to charge it for a an hour or two, but then eventually I guess it dried out and back to normal.It came with android 10, upgraded to 11, and now to 12 without issue. Generally get an update monthly.I kind of like the bare bones android experience vs. other stuff you get from other vendors (bixby, etc). But that's just me. Works find with android auto, though I wish I could use that wirelessly (maybe a limitation of my car)For me, I don't care if I have an iphone or android phone, so always looking around to see what is out there. The new iphone mini 13 looks interesting, but I can't justify spending any more money when this is working so well for me. I'm starting to miss the 5g as this has started to expand in my area, so maybe that will drive me to a new phone eventually. But for now, this phone has been perfect for me.",2021年10月22日 在美国审核
All the phone you need at a great price and with an excellent form factor,"Picked up my Pixel 4a through Visible a couple of days ago. So far, this is an excellent phone and exactly what I needed. I read a lot of reviews here and elsewhere, so I'll address my trepidations were buying the Pixel 4a.My phone before the 4a was a Pixel 2. I was, overall, happy with this phone although it was clearly dated.Build quality and plasticsSome reviews suggested that the phone felt like a toy. It's made out of plastic and does lack that certain feel of glass or metal (I prefer metal, like the Pixel 2, myself), it's well put together and feels good in the hands. I don't think it feels like a toy or cheap although it doesn't feel like a flagship phone, and that's fine because the 4a is clearly a midrange feel. I personally prefer plastic to glass as it seems more sturdy. There's no flex or anything else, and the phone feels very solid.Form factorOne of the biggest selling points of the 4a is its compact form factor. I hate large phones. Phone sizes have creeped up over the years and before getting my Pixel 2 renewed on Amazon I was using a Nokia phone that was considerably bigger. It never felt comfortable in the hand.The Pixel 4a might, if anything, feel a bit too small but maybe that's because my P2 was slightly bigger. Once I slipped a cover on (the X-level Google Pixel 4a Case Slim Fit) it felt perfect. I usually avoid covers because the phones feel too bulky afterward but that's not the case with the 4a.ScreenLove the screen. Some people may not like the hole punch for the camera but it doesn't bother me. I know a lot of Android phones are moving up from 60hz to 90 or 120 hz (higher hz creates smoother scrolling and movement). The 4a sticks with 60hz and I think that's fine. Apple also sticks with 60z and for a good reason: it's better on battery life. Most TVs are still 60hz as well, I don't think most people will be bothered by 60hz unless coming from a higher hz phone.Colors are great, the resolution means you don't see pixels. While some reviews complained about brightness, I find the 4a is plenty bright. The screen is pretty reflective, however.Swiping and touch input registers well in my experience. The screen does gather fingerprints quicker than I'd like.Battery LifeI was worried about battery life but so far the 4a doesn't struggle with moderate usage and lasts all day easily. Most importantly, Google seems to really have optimized standby power usage. If I leave my 4a off the charge and don't use it for 8 hours (tested while sleeping) I only lose about 2 percent. If I left my P2 off the charger, it'd still drain pretty quickly and I'd come back with like half the battery left (in fairness, the battery is pretty old now).InternalsThe biggest downside to the P4a is probably the internals, but it's important to remember that this phone only costs $350. The processor and ram offer for a good user experience, and while power users may need something more powerful, I doubt it'll affect me for at least 2 or 3 years. The 6gb ram ensures good multitasking. The battery is a bit small, but as noted above, battery life is solid if not excellent.There's no 5G, which is a big downside. The P4a 5G was too big for me so I skipped that. With my own usage, I doubt the lack of 5g will affect me much, but for future proofing and what not, I'd definitely still rather have it.Fingerprint readerSnappy, accurate, and you can enable downswips to bring up notifications, which is really convenient. Some reviewers complained that the thumbprint reader was too shallow and hard to find. I disagree, after a few minutes of usage, I could find it every time quickly. Now I have a cover on so the thumbprint reader is much deeper.ChargingCharges pretty quickly but other companies are installing faster charging in their phone. The P4a using 18w charging, I know some phone companies are using 30w (not much faster in real life) and 65w charging (substantially faster). It'd be nice to have faster charging.No wireless charging either, which would be a nice added feature. But again, this is a $350 phone.AndroidI like Pixel phones because they offer the best android experience IMO. That's the same here. I wish Google offered 4 years of support (like apple) instead of 3 but either way it's a great experience.ConclusionI am a moderate user in regards to phones, I play simple games, check email, message people, etc. For my uses, the Pixel 4a is a close to perfect phone, and while there are some shortcomings, I just remind myself that this is a $350 phone.",2020年12月21日 在美国审核
Great phone at a great price!,"I really like the 4a. I figured what the heck at just $349 and with all the great reviews I figured I'd take a chance on it. Glad I did. I bought mine from Google because they had them in stock and Amazon didn't at that time. I really like the small size. The camera in this thing is every bit as good or better than my expensive Nikon digital camera. I don't know if it's the internet service or if it's the phone either way this thing is fast. Some people are complaining about having to swipe the screen to navigate so if they'll go to settings, then to accessability and then system navigation you'll find the old 3 button navigation system that you can switch to. If you take the time and go through all the settings you can find a lot stuff to adjust to make using this phone a lot easier to use. The battery in my opinion is fine. I've been using my 4a since early this morning and its 6:42 pm now and I still have 40 percent battery power remaining. I purchased the LK screen protectors for mine here on Amazon and they fit and work perfectly and were easy to install. You can't beat the price at $9.99 for 4 of the tempered glass protectors that include an installation frame, wet and dry wipes, a tool to remove air bubbles and lint picker uppers. They have a good installation video on the LK website. I also purchased a case cover and holster with a belt clip on Amazon. It also fits perfectly. You can find it if you search on Amazon under ""Encased Pixel 4a belt clip case (thin armor) slim grip cover with holster for Google Pixel 4a - black"". They're only $16.99. The case cover is flexible and it covers the edge of the phone all the way around. The rubber case feels better to the touch than the hard plastic and it's not slick. No problem getting to the fingerprint reader and the camera lens is not blocked. It's a great little phone in my opinion.",2020年11月23日 在美国审核
A great Google product. The google assistant is the best feature. Nice night mode. Worth its price.,"I loved almost every second of this Google Pixel 4a. The frosted case is very comfortable to hold. I enjoy how easily it slipped into my pocket, or how easily it is to use with single hand.I've had zero performance issues so far. I was surprised there was no sort of slowdown or sluggishness at all. I've owned several android phones and had the Pixel 4a for a while. It’s performed pretty much flawlessly, both the software and the hardware.I haven’t been easy on trying to push the 4a to its limit. It works so well and smooth on its system.The best part is when I am wearing the face mask, it is fantastic to have a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone.The battery life of this new 4a has been good enough. I was able to get through a full day using, but just barely. If it is used heavily like watching youtube/ Netflix/ playing games for a long time, I think the backup power will be required.I am a Google fan so I installed a lot of smart devices in my house. The google assistant connects my Nest ring camera, Nest AC control, Google home, switches. If you need to set reminders, open apps, send messages, adjust the settings, of control your smart home, instead of scrolling and clicking, all can be set up through voice control on google assistant.And I was very surprised by the quality of the photos my 4a taked. I do love all cam features! And the night mode feature!! I am in love with it as you dont need to be professional to take amazing night and light shots.I believe that the phones at the same price are not comparable to it. The speakers are with high quality and bass! Transcribe feature works good. Screen resolution is beautiful as well.I am very grateful that Pixel 4a uses the classic 3.5MM headphone jack. You know that all good headphones use 3.5mm. Now I can use my headphone without a conncter.Overall, it’s a great phone! I would highly recommend it. I think the 4a is worth for its price.",2020年9月15日 在美国审核

"So far, so good!","I've been using Samsung phones for years now, so I was nervous about switching.. but so far I have no complaints about this phone! I bought this because while I liked my S10 just fine, I somehow broke the camera lense and didn't feel like getting it fixed. I was going on vacation with my family, and wanted something I could take good photos with, while not breaking the bank. I haven't noticed any real drawbacks so far going from the Samsung to this phone. If you're a heavy gamer or someone that likes having the newest and greatest device, then obviously this isn't for you. I myself realized I'm not really using the high-end features I've been over paying for, so I'll probably be going for mid range phones from now on. This seems to be sufficient for social media, checking email, texting, watching videos, etc. Also, my vacation photos turned out great! As of now, I highly recommend this phone, I think it's a steal!

I got this for the camera!,"I got this as a backup phone but honestly the main reason was for the camera. I LOVE the camera and app that comes with this phone. It takes fantastic images, of course the person using the camera has a lot to do with that, but it has the capabilities I need to take great shots, what ultimately sold me on this was the ability to capture in RAW, if you are into photography, you already know what this means. It has more than enough space on the hard drive to capture lots and lots of photos (including RAW) and videos. The way this phone's camera and app processes pictures is a real treat, and even though there aren't a bunch of lenses, it more than makes up for it in the resulting shots.The phone is small, it fits in my hand nicely, I'm still not used to the fingerprint reader being on the back, my daily phone has a fingerprint reader in the screen.

A Great Basic Phone,"While the Google Pixel 4a might be a no-frills phone, it's a really nice one! I switched to it from a very basic Android A20 and the big difference is the Google's massive memory and camera. It's just right for me.I don't miss facial recognition since I don't use it.My A20 doesn't charge wirelessly either, so I don't miss that, either.I do appreciate the fingerprint sensor and the camera is absolutely fantastic. My A20 doesn't have a lot of memory so it can get slowed down due to the amount of photos I've got stored on it. That's not a problem for the 4a.It does take a few seconds for the photos to be ready, but I don't mind that at all.You get three years worth of upgrades with this economically priced phone, and you don't get massive amounts of bloatware like my Android has.

Google it.Not prosNo wireless charging. If this is something you need give this one a pass.Water resistant but not waterproof.Not 5G. I personally could give two hoots about 5G, my speeds are fast as they are and I sure don't need to pay the mmWave tax for Verizon that makes the Pixel 5 too expensive.Only 1 size, no XL.Plastic back. Mine is hidden by my case so I don't care what it looks like and to me it doesn't feel cheaply made.Slower processor than Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5.

I wanted to like this phone...,"I should start by saying that up until I got the 4a I was a repeat offender of the iPhone. I was ready to cut the cord and get an Android and I thought I was going to love my Pixel for the sheer fact that it wasn't an iPhone. I've had this since the week it came out (about 2 months now) and I regret this purchase immensely.The Pixel is really quirky, it stutters and lags with frustrating frequency when hitting buttons, often taking 2-3 seconds to ""think"" before executing the task you told it to (even if it's just to close a window). Beyond that, I constantly find myself clicking on things I didn’t intend to. It seems as if when making a swipe, like scrolling through a website, it lags for a split-second mid-swipe and reads it as if you’re clicking on whatever is under your thumb at the moment of the lag. This is extremely frustrating when you find yourself constantly clicking on ads accidentally, or unintentionally “liking” your ex-girlfriends Instagram post as you scroll through your feed (believe me, your excuse won’t be considered valid in the eyes of your current partner).It's interface is unintuitive, which I'll admit is partially a learning curve with the switch from Apple to Android. I hate to compare it to my iPhone 7 but that's all I know; simple things like vibration patterns, red notification dots on app icons, etc... that are standard on an iPhone are not standard options on Android. I understand that people want the opportunity to fully ""customize"" their phone, but I don't want to have to learn how to program macros to make my phone's vibrate setting less annoying.The camera that everyone raves about... it's just okay. Certainly better than the iPhone 7, but there's something artificial about it. Photo's make everything look almost like plastic and definitely not natural. Plus, the photo library is a maze of confusing folders. It requires navigating through 5-6 folders and sub-folders to attach a photo to a text from an SMS app. When you save a photo that is sent to you, you'd think it would go into your photo library but no, it goes into it's own ""messages"" subfolder that you'll have to dig for later. I'm sure there's a macro for that, but c'mon...Call volume is bipolar at best; it is either whisper-quiet even at full volume on speakerphone, or deafeningly loud. Even when my volume is at 0 (not an exaggeration, literally 0) the volume of the call is sometimes eardrum-bursting. It's inconsistent, you never know what you're going to get, and I'm almost scared to put the phone to my ear in fear of rupturing an ear-drum.The kicker for me, and the reason I finally decided to write this review, was earlier today when I started hearing voices come from my phone while it was not being used. Sitting at my desk doing work, with all apps closed, screen black, and faint voices start emitting from the phone like I was in a group-call. I don’t think I’m in need of a séance, but I also can’t explain that and it doesn’t make me feel comfortable about this phone in any way.I don’t want to sound entirely negative; the plastic casing that most people complain about doesn’t bug me. It makes the phone lightweight and, lets be honest, do you know ANYONE who doesn’t use a phone case? Even though the screen is mid-grade, it’s more than adequate and I’m glad that it has a headphone jack, even if it’s just for nostalgia and collecting pocket lint.At this point, I'm considering my $400 a loss. I know I’m in the minority here; all the “professional” phone reviews rave about this phone. But they only used it for a few hours, maybe a couple of days. This has been my personal experience, do what you want with it. As for me, I'm deactivating this phone and going back to my iPhone 7. This was a horrible experience and a regretful purchase.",2020年10月9日 在美国审核

Check!The features that Google spared on the Pixel 4a, I don’t think are essential and only serve to drive the price up, this include:- Wireless charging.- Waterproof certification.- Multi-camera setup.- High refresh display.- 5G Network.Here are some phones I was considering:OnePlus NordFor a moment I was thinking about it, as it comes with the more recent Snapdragon 765 SOC, 90Hz refresh display, but the fact that it didn’t come with stereo speakers, headphone jack, gimmicky quad camera setup and it’s not available in the US was a turn off.Samsung / MotoI was considering also the Samsung Galaxy A71, but I don’t appreciate that it comes loaded with bloatware. Another good contender was the Motorola One Fusion+, but I didn’t want to deal with any issues with the pop-up selfie camera. All other Chinese brands were out of the equation, as I don’t like their OS UIs, as I prefer the closer to stock Android experience.The Pixel 4a has a very good balance of features in a compact size.PROS- Clean bloatware free software.- 3 years of mayor Android OS updates.- Killer camera with night and astrophotography modes.- Good performance with 6GB of RAM.- Plenty of storage with 128GB.CONS- Battery size: I hope the 3140mAh battery is enough for the needs of tomorrow (I’m upgrading from a similar 3000mAh phone that has degraded to 2784mAh after three years of use).- Snapdragon 730: I can’t help to think that the SD765 would be better future-proof, but the 730 will be more than enough if you don't game.- No microSD slot to expand storage.I think google has hit a home-run with this one, if you can live with those caveats, just get it!However if you think you could do a little better, wait a little longer for the Pixel 4a 5G (revealed on late September / early October), as rumors say it will come with Snapdragon 765, a bigger battery, dual back lens, and 5G for $150 more.",2020年8月26日 在美国审核
Simply The Best Way To Enjoy The Android Experience And Awesome Touchscreen!!!,"Google pixel 4a-small, light and comfortable! I love this phone. Battery life is sufficient for all day with no charging. The screen is smaller than my last few phones but it is still super easy to type on and navigate! The camera quality is splendid and has tons of features. It is quick and accurate to go from app to app with no lagging, and is super quick for the fingerprint scanner to recognize my print. I really have no complaints with the phone at all and see it holding up for awhile in the future!",2020年9月22日 在美国审核
"In Many Ways, Comparable to My iPhone","Given that the Pixel is around 1/3 the cost of my current iPhone, I consider it a viable substitute. Here's what I like and dislike about it:(+) Smaller than my iPhone yet feels right. In the course of usage, you don't feel that the size is inadequate.(+) Apps are very useful if you chose to activate the phone no. I watch the news via this phone, which saves my iPhone's battery life.(+) Battery life is quite adequate. Through ""heavy"" usage, I manage only to reach 1/2 battery life.Dislikes:(-) Actually, my only peeve is that it could be easy to pair. I don't think the process is all that intuitive.",2020年11月6日 在美国审核
More Power or a Larger Screen? That is the Question!,"--PRODUCT NAME: Google Pixel 4a - New Unlocked Android Smartphone - 128 GB of Storage - Up to 24 Hour Battery - Just Black--ASIN: B08CFSZLQ4--PRICE AT REVIEW TIME: $349.99QUICK OVERVIEWOn a Scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best.A Mixed Bag-FUNCTION (8 of 10): Small screen and no SD card slot. Charges really fast. Crisp operation, Clear screen.DESIGN (8 of 10): Slim, nearly edge to edge screen, but a plastic case.FIT, FINISH, QUALITY (7 of 10): No water resistance certification. Well built, but nothing exceptional.VALUE: (7 of 10): Depends on what you need. You can get a bigger screen for a LOT less.OVERALL RATING: 7.5 out of 10DETAILED REVIEWFirst, you can find many reviews of the Pixel 4a on the web, so I’m not going to to do “just another cute review” that cannibalizes other reviews and reproduces everything you can find on your own. I’m going to review this phone as I use it for my needs. That way, you can decide whether or not it is more suited to your own needs, or not.I use phones in a business like way. I don’t game on a phone, or anything else that might take huge amounts of graphics and processor power. I’m not an app person. I like full fledged computerprograms. I grew up with computers, and I’ve never been able to make the productivity leap to a phone, because it isn’t there: The screens are far too small, they don’t have real keyboards (yes I can type), and their SOC’s (Systems on a Chip) are too convoluted, unfocused, advertisement oriented, and proprietary for me. I do most of my work on a computer with a 32” screen.Mainly, I use my phone for communications and appointment notifications, such as texting, calls, and my calendar and that’s about it. I do need a decent camera option, for which the Pixel really excels—for my needs.The Pixel 4a is equally sufficient for my video needs. However, it does not excel at close up images. About the closest I can get is about 5"" from the subject.I also need a navigation option, and the Pixel 4a is sufficient for that, although the Google maps application is not as clear and focused as it should be for my needs. Also, when using the Pixel horizontally, the maps screen is cluttered. For instance, the arrival time panel covers the speed limit panel. Also, there is no way to hide the Arrival Panel, and it takes up about 20% of the screen. Really, Google, when I arrive is more important than the speed limit--without the option to move or hide the arrival time panel? Those types of things are really annoying.Also, the Bluetooth announcements do not work in navigation mode in my 2019 car. If I am connected using BT, I cannot hear the driving directions. The phone book will not download contacts, either, or recent calls and their numbers. Incoming text messages read aloud--nope!Nothing else audio-call related worksFor instance, incoming texts are muted when the phone is connected to my car's Bluetooth. All of these things my 2014 Lumia could do. The only thing I can get the Pizxel4a to do is ring when I have an incoming call, and I can push the ""accept"" button on the car's screen to receive the call.In short, I need a calendar, texting, calls, navigation with light camera and video options , with a few other apps that prove useful, such as Uber. Any phone will do that.So, why get a Pixel 4a with all of the power and high resolution, but a small screen?For me, I would not choose the Pixel 4a. The reason I did is because I was previously using a Microsoft Lumia 640, and it’s end of life, no more development, no backups, and at some point I will need a new phone. Since I’m a Vine reviewer, I received this phone free for my review.I would not spend $350.00 on a small screen like the Pixel 4a—because I don't need lots of processing or graphics power. What I do need is to be able to see my screen, and see it well.For my needs, a sub $200.00 phone with a huge screen is more practical, even if it has only 32GB of internal memory with slower processor and graphics options. Memory isn't really a problem either, as those types of phones come with SD slots, and you can purchase a name brand 128GB micro SD card for $23.00.I don’t have any problem with the Pixel 4a’s performance. It’s fast and crisp to operate, but nothing exceptionally different from my old 2014 Windows Lumia phone, again, for my needs. The screen is the same size as my old Lumia, just about, but higher resolution.Again, I don't need a super high resolution phone because I don’t live in the cell phone ecosystem. I just need a screen that is easy to see and clear. The same thing applies to cell phone processing and graphics power. I don’t need that.All of the physical options worked well for me, including the finger print reader. The camera identifies hot spots and dark areas and quickly spits out HDR images, and that is really remarkable. The zoom is impressive also, keeping 300 feet targets fairly well defined.The Pixel 4a works well in all aspects, except the Bluetooth and Navigation areas explained above, but one thing I have noticed is that when you work it, even with battery saver on, it chews through the battery (e.g., navigation--bye, bye battery). It does charge very quickly, however. FUNCTION: All physical options, including the finger print reader, worked perfectly. The Pixel 4a charges amazingly fast, and it comes with 128GB internal memory. DESIGN: Small, slim, easy to carry, light. FIT, FINISH AND QUALITY: Feels solid enough, but see negatives. VALUE: For my needs, too much for such a small screen. TECHNICAL: Really good camera performance, even in HDR situations, such as shooting into the sun.FUNCTION: Small screen. Decent but not great battery life. No SD card slot. Has Bluetooth car connection issues (no voice navigation and all notifications are tuned off) and the Maps app is cluttered in horizontal view.FIT, FINISH AND QUALITY: Plastic case, no water resistance rating.VALUE: You sacrifice a large screen for more power, so be aware of that.CONCLUSION AND FINAL THOUGHTSBuying a phone for $350.00 isn’t something I would do casually. To me, that’s a lot of money. I would rather spend less and get a much larger screen, because I use my phone mostly for basic business like functions, such as texting, calls, some camera, and navigation. I don't work on my phone and I don’t socialize on it either. I don’t use many apps, and I don't game or perform other higher end functions on a phone.I can buy a sub $200.00 phone with a huge screen. For me,a larger screen with a less powerful phone fits my needs more than a more powerful phone and a smaller screen. That, and a 128GB microSD card costs $23.00.Whether the Pixel 4a meets your needs depends on what you need.For me, I’d rather have a larger screen and a less powerful phone.This product met expectations, but did not exceed them.",2020年9月20日 在美国审核
Must buy. Amazing phone from Google. For only $350,"Great software experience and camera. The front look like a premium phone.The phone feels really fast. Great screen and it can get really bright. It's huge jump in brightness since the pixel 4 or the older versions.Best fingerprint reader I have experienced. Upgraded from pixel 3 and this fingerprint reader feels a lot more accurate and quick.This phone doesn't have: IP rating, wireless charger, SD card reader.The body is made by plastic. Light weighted and durable. You won't need a case for this phone. I would recommend to skin on instead.",2020年11月7日 在美国审核
More Drawbacks Than Reviews Told Me About,"Got the pixel 4a, knowing the battery wasn't the best.Camera is excellent, as most reviewers mentioned.But I did not see the following, which would have made me think again about buying it:1.NOT AS 'UNLOCKED' AS YOU THINK.Got the unlocked version, but am still locked into features that cannot be changed.Example: the default on-screen keyboard.Needing a Delete Key, which is not present on the Pixel 4a's default, I downloaded a thirdy party keyboard... only to learn YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE DEFAULT ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD, EVEN ON THE UNLOCKED VERSION.That alone would have made me go elsewhere, but it is now my 21st day owning this phone, which brings me to:2.15-DAY RETURN POLICY, NO MORE.If you're past the fifteen days of having purchased (or received, if you ordered it), you are S.O.L.You might counter 15 days is not bad, and in fact is quite typical, considering all that could be done with a phone in that period.But this is Google we're talking about, and when you see them accepting a non-optimal standard, it's probably because that standard makes them more money than they think could be brought onboard by challenging it.3.RESTOCKING FEE.Even if you manage to return your phone within the 15 days, you'll have to pay for the shipping and a restocking fee.The payment of one is marginally acceptable, IMO, but when you see a company genuinely confident in their product, they'll cover both.By only covering one (or neither) Google is telling us they get a lot more of these consumer-rejected returns than expected.",2020年11月8日 在美国审核
Great phone. Fast and not ridiculously large,"This is a perfectly sized phone.No large bezels so it's almost all screen, and small enough to fit in your pocket.Thanks to a plastic back, it's also lightweight compared to phones with a heavy glass back.To the people griping about plastic; most people immediately put a case on their phone, so I don't see the big deal. And the plastic back is one less thing to break if you drop it.The camera takes fantastic pictures and NightSight &amp; Portrait Mode are unbelievable. It takes photos that rival phones costing 2 or 3 times as much.If you enable Battery Optimization, the phone will learn which apps you use the most, withholding power to apps you rarely/never use. After enabling this feature, I only charge my phone about every other day, now.",2021年5月9日 在美国审核
"Awesome Battery Life, But No IPX Rating, No Wireless Charging and no Face Unlock","I moved from a Note 8 to the Pixel 4a and it was mostly a pleasant experience but in the end I switched back.I was initially concerned with how much smaller this phone is compared to my Note but the smaller size started to grow on me.It's easy to hold and you can reach all the buttons one handed.The material and weight of the phone does make it feel ""cheaper"" but it material did have a nice feel to it and the buttons are VERY clicky.The battery life on this phone was AMAZING!I got close to 34 hours from a full charge. This was a drastic improvement over my Note which barely makes it through half the day now. The camera was pretty decent but I must admit I did not take very many photos. I think I prefer the camera from my Note over this one.My favorite part about the Pixel 4a is actually the Android 11 experience. The Pixel software features are well thought out and really improved my daily interactions.The automatic call screening is a huge relief from the frequent sales and spam calls I would receive throughout the day. The phone would try to suggest a set time for bed to gain better sleep and auto dim, change the color temperature, and adjust the notification settings.The software with the phone feels really polished and it was a wonderful experience to use.Now for the cons...One of my biggest issues is Google did not provide an IPX rating for this phone.Yes it is a cheap phone but I do not want to accidentally cause water damage from using it in rain, because we don't know its rating!Other negatives in my opinion are -no face unlock/ID, not IRIS unlock, the fingerprint scanner works well but not perfect especially if it gets the slightest bit dirty.Also, I have gotten pretty spoiled with wireless charging so the Pixel 4a not having that feature was a huge let down.This is an awesome phone for what it does at this price point, but I'm switching back to my Note 8 and eagerly awaiting the Pixel 5 release.",2020年9月24日 在美国审核
"When it works, it's great.","Bought this directly from Google, not off Amazon. I'll try to keep this concise. NOTE: I've owned the Pixel 2, Pixel 3, and now the 4a. This is the last Google device I plan on owning until their finished product becomes more reliable. Every single device I've owned from Google has had some kind of different issue: the 2's camera stopped working; the 3's battery started draining inexplicable and dramatically; and now - the 4a - randomly reboots without any prompting from the user. The solution? get a replacement from Google...the problem - those replacements have the same issues.Google should get out of hardware, until they're ready to be more reliable when it comes to their finished products. If you're dropping hundreds of dollars on a smartphone in 2020, it is reasonable to expect it to work. WHEN this phone works, it's a solid phone with a great camera and solid battery life...IF it was dependable, it'd be a good value. But, like all of their handsets to date, know that you're taking a risk when you purchase one (if you don't get a dud, you'll be happy with this).",2020年10月28日 在美国审核
Best value!,Preordered the phone to receive a day before release day. Coming from an almost 3 year old iphone 8 my expectations weren't the highest. But this phone is so worth the money. I accidentally dropped it in a puddle during rain and it made it (don't recommend trying this). Screen could be a tad brighter but it's great to have small vessels. It tends to turn off when dropped from a distance but turns on immediately and it hasn't cracked. First Google phone and don't regret it. Battery is amazing unless gaming too much.

Real review:just an average phone,"I pre-ordered this phone a month before it was released thinking it would be an amazing phone. And also my first Pixel device. The first con was it was ""released"" at the end of August, yet I didn't receive it until September 16th. So not off to a great start. I rarely say negative things about a smartphone but in this case, I feel like there aren't enough reviews outlining the issues I encountered with this phone.I'll start with the prosGreat pricePretty good camera128 gb of storage6 gb of ram3 years of updatesNow onto the consDim screen. This one surprised me for this to be an OLED screen the brightness was very unimpressive.Especially outside.Battery life wasn't nearly as good as advertised. The photo of the screen on time I included was the best I ever got. Not even close to the 7-8 hours advertised or in most reviews.The size felt small despite being a 5.8 inch screen. To me this is a con because of my vision.Overall this device is good but in my opinion not great for the price. I ultimately sold it pretty quickly. I am a huge fan of Motorola which the setup of the Pixel is almost identical to. Except you pay noticeably more. I got a Moto g fast on cyber Monday for $105 which is a much better value for the price.I also was able to get a Samsung galaxy a51 right after I sold my Pixel which is much brighter with better battery life for $199. Point being my advice is look at all your options before buying this device. While it's a solid phone, mid range and even some lower end devices are getting really good. And offer as much if not more than phones like the Pixel 4a. The purpose for me doing this review is to potentially help anyone trying to decide whether to get this or not. Hopefully my experience with it will have helped you.",2020年12月3日 在美国审核

"Really, pretty so-so.","Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed with this phone, though I really wanted to like it.I made my purchase directly through Google, not Amazon, but I really felt like saying something about the 4a.Every phone has features that you like or dislike and the dislikes with this phone have been a real turn-off.I bought the 4a as a replacement for a ASUS Zenfone 3 Max, which I really loved until the camera started taking mushy photos.In-fact, that's the main reason I replaced the Zenfone, which was otherwise functioning flawlessly.For about two and a half years, the Zenfone actually took really great photos.The 64 megapixel mode could capture clear signs on a building from half a mile away.One day, it just started taking bad pics.So when I heard of all of the hype behind the Pixel 4a and the fantastic photographic abilities, I was really excited.I'm not one to spend a massive amount on a phone, so the idea of getting a ""flagship class"" camera at an affordable price really got my attention.I waited about a month to receive the phone.I liked the lack of bloatware.I immediately changed the swiping features to the old fashioned buttons at the bottom of the screen.Just couldn't get the hang of the gestures.I find the height of the screen just right.I've come to hate the narrow width, which make me feel like I'm breaking my thumbs when I key.Mind you, I don't have large hands, but for me personally, it beats the heck out of my thumbs to key with the 4a.I like the screen overall.The blacks are deep.The screen is a little too cool for me, so I actually prefer to use the phone in night mode and switch to normal when I'm talking pics.HOWEVER, there are often occasions when the screen stutters when scrolling through web pages.It's not on every page, but I will invariably see stuttering on multiple webpages over the course of the day.I have never seen this behavior in my old Zenphone...ever.Another annoyance is the frequency with which my 4a refuses to load a webpage.Maybe a few times a day, I'll run a search for something and the phone will freeze while opening the webpage.The progress meter will just hang at about 10% and the page won't open.Maybe 30 seconds later, eureka, it opens.Given none of our other phones in the family do this, I don't believe it's a WiFi thing.It must be buggy software.One thing that really irritates me...Let me explain.Let's say I open the Google app and search for 'Moon Landing'.I find an interesting article that mentions Neil Armstrong.I copy Neil Armstrong, open another Google windows and search for him.When I want to go back to the Moon Landing article, which I minimized to search for Neil,well...it's gone!If you try to open the Google app more than once, the original window will disappear in favor of the new window.This NEVER happened on my Zenfone.I could open Google a dozen times and search many different topics.If I minimized a window, I could always return to it.Why the Pixel 4a doesn't work that way is baffling. In-fact, I sat the two phones side by side and tried this.Every time, the Pixel would close the minimized Google window.Yet the Zenfone gave me many Google tabs to work with.For me personally, this is the worst feature (or non-feature) of the 4a.The stereo speakers sound quite nice.No real complaints there.Battery life.It's really so-so.I'm not exactly a power user.I keep the screen brightness in the lower third of the scale.I tend to scroll through the news in the morning, watch a few news clips and maybe some YouTube and I find myself recharging at about mid-day if I want to make it to the evening.Google should really have given the 4a a larger battery.I imagine, given how batteries degrade over time, that in a year or so, this battery will have pretty sad life.So finally, the camera...Portraits are something to behold.I've been into photography for a long time now and I've got to say that the 4a is one of those cameras that captures the ""soul"" of the subject--a real old-fashioned Kodachrome feel.Night mode is decent overall, though it tends to capture weird pixelated halos around store signs that are quite distracting and that I never witnessed in my Zenfone's better days.Aside from the above, the 4a takes a nosedive on most other photos.If you're a pixel peeper, you're not going to be happy.Let's imagine a daylight photo taken of a row of building 50 meters away.Upon initial inspection the photo will look pretty good.Colors are vivid and accurate.Zoom in on a photo and the pics become very pixelated and ""artifacty"".Distinct lines are broken and edgy.Actually, I'd call them mushy, not unlike my sick Zenfone.Unfortunately, I take a lot of landscape photos and there are times when computational photography can't make up for raw megapixel count.Frankly, in it's prime, my old Zenfone would have trounced all over the 4a in landscape photography--and by a wide margin.No kidding.It's really up to you what you do.I know a lot of folks are happy with the 4a.With respect to photography, if you do almost entirely portraits, you should be happy.I would definitely pick something else of I had it to do again.I'm not making a recommendation, just giving my opinion.I'd certainly go for something with a bigger battery and a better sensor for landscape photography.Best wishes!",2020年11月14日 在美国审核
"As good as a ""flagship"" phone with a couple of notable omissions.  Excellent fingerprint scanner.","For the price (being about a third of current big name flagship phones) this phone is a great option.But, there are a few things missing that I wish it had.As an amateur photographer, I like having a phone that can fill in for (or replace) a pocket camera for those everyday pictures when it isn't convenient to carry a full size DSLR.So the good news is that while the camera isn't quite as nice as some of the most expensive phones out there, it's easily as good as most pocket cameras as recently as just a few years ago.You will not be disappointed with the results from this camera.But that does lead into one of the phone's drawbacks, the lack of a micro SD card slot.Without one, you are limited to the internal storage of the phone itself, and once that is full, you'll need to backup your files and delete them from the phone to make room.With 128 GB of internal storage, most casual users will not run out of space quickly, however, unless you are recording tons of videos all the time.The lack of a removable card slot is mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of a USB OTG adapter that will allow you to attach a thumb drive or other USB accessory to the phone.This will let you easily backup your files to an external drive to free up space on the phone, if it becomes necessary.It also allows you to easily connect USB accessories and peripherals like a keyboard or projector, for example.The screen is a good size, extending almost to the edges (but not quite wrapping around like a Galaxy phone).The rear facing ""selfie"" camera is embedded in the screen, so that's a nice modern styling touch common to other current generation phones.The front facing camera and flash LED light are housed in a pod on the back of the phone which protrudes approximately 1.5mm from the back surface.This is sort of an unsightly break in an otherwise smooth, aesthetically pleasing housing.I am sure the aftermarket will step up with phone cases that protect this little pod from dings and scratches.The screen itself curves down at the edges to meet a thin plastic bezel to transition into the plastic case back.Additionally the fingerprint scanner is conveniently located in the center of the phone back where your index finger naturally lands when holding the phone.Every other phone I have used has had occasional scanning errors but this one has unlocked easily every time.I'm not sure if that means it would be easy to fool the scanner, but it is undoubtedly more convenient and so far is the best fingerprint scanner I've used on a phone, so Google really nailed this feature.The speakers sound a little hollow when held in the hand listening to music, but they improve when the phone is laid on a hard surface like a desk. There is a TRRS audio in/out jack so you can connect headphones, speakers, a microphone or a speaker/mic headset, among other things.Some niche apps (like certain amateur radio apps) require this jack so it's good that it's present.Actual phone audio is excellent.I simply swapped my micro sim out of my old phone and into this one and it immediately recognized it and is able to make and receive calls as if nothing changed.I get no complaints about low volume or poor sound from people on the other end of the line either.Another feature I miss from my old phone is WiFi calling.This allows you to make and receive voice calls over a WiFi router when a phone network connection is unavailable.It's a great feature that I have found very useful many times, but sadly it doesn't appear to be present in this phone (at least, not on the OEM phone app).Screen clarity, color and resolution are all too good to complain about.Touch sensitivity is good.Like most phones in the last 5 years or so, there is no way for the end user to easily replace the battery.And with the rapid development of Android, your phone's processing power will probably be obsolete before you significantly wear out the battery.I typically charge my phones every night and take them off the charger in the morning.I've had phones last for 3 years, but that was the absolute longest I've managed to go before upgrading.And by that time my old phone was struggling to run the current Android build.Still, I really, really wish modern phones still had a provision for changing the batteries.Okay, so what else?It's a Google phone so you are going to get a cleaner version of Android than you would on a Samsung or other brand because there isn't going to be as many bloatware apps.It doesn't have a Qi charging coil inside so you won't be able to use wireless charging.This is a feature I liked from my other recent phones because you can put a little piece of tape over the USB port to keep pocket lint from getting in, and just charge it wirelessly.With the 4a, you'll have to plug it in to charge it, and that means the plug will have to be open to the elements.Overall it's a really nice phone when considered on its own.When compared to other phones (costing a lot more) it lacks some features, but for the price you get a lot of great features and functionality.If you are looking for an android phone that checks almost all the boxes and will save you a lot of money versus a flagship phone, this is a solid choice.",2020年9月30日 在美国审核
Great Phone for Price,"Purchased 2 Pixel 4a phones a couple of weeks ago after owning HTC One for 6 years. Pixel is half the weight, smaller overall footprint but more screen real estate. Had to return one phone due to getting shocked while holding and erratic volume. Replacement was fine. Google, as usual, believes it owns all personal data generated from using phone. Constant pop ups, reminders, etc. until I figured out how to turn everything off possible. Menus 2-4 deep, nothing like Android on HTC. After 3 long days finally figured things out. Even the phone app was confusing. Aggregation will soon be fading memory. Very happy with usability now. Great camera. OK battery life as don’t download videos or other battery intensive applications. Fast recharge. Highly recommend.Used Pixel 4a for 3 weeks now. Google software is very buggy. Programs disappear on reboot, settings frequently change on own (mostly Google trying to steal personal information), new programs appearing I never even looked at, nagware, to name a few. The phone app is barely usable. The Contacts has a mind of its own with new names appearing and old ones disappearing. It is worthless. Texting app is not much better than phone software. Sorry I bought this phone. Had 3 other android phones without all the headaches. Battery life barely allows one to get through day, although fast charge is awesome.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核
Competitive with iPhone SE-2020,"My little family has used phones from Apple and Samsung for many years. This phone from Google is in the same price range as iPhone SE-2020 and I can compare the two.This phone from Google is larger than the iPhone. The iPhone has wireless charging, this phone does not. The look and feel of the iPhone is slick and glassy, the Google phone is slightly plasticky. Both phones feature a stupid,sticking-out camera structure on the back. The Google phone offers a bit more protection to the camera lenses than the iPhone. The Apple phone features software that is much less of a privacy/security problem than the Google phone. This is true for the Android operating system, which is designed to spy on you. It is also true of the Google app store, which is a cesspool of creepy software.This phone from Google replaces an ancient iPhone that our teenager is using. Her transition from iPhone to Android went smoothly. She reports that ""The interface is easy to use and very elegant. The functions are all well organized and easy to find on the screen as well. The camera captures clear and beautiful pictures.""With Android phones such as this, getting big software updates can be a problem. Your phone carrier might prevent it, and the phone maker may also prevent it. Choosing an Android phone from Google itself might prove to be an advantage. With a Google phone, you also lose a layer of low quality software from the phone carrier and the phone maker.Honestly, I really dislike Android but this phone is a very nice piece of work. It is a solid value as well.",2020年9月24日 在美国审核

A phone that doesn’t phone it in…,"Review Result:[Buy Today, Get it Someday, or Skip Past Any day]Buy today, this is a very solid and high-quality cell phone to meet your everyday needs… for now.It has a great camera, good battery life, and a nice-looking screen.The camera in particular gets much more clear photos faster than all my previous phones.The fingerprint reader works like a charm.I don’t like face recognition, so I don’t use it.I do like the swipe gesture navigation too. My old phone must have had an older android OS version, so it was missing this.The main downside is no support for 5G.Many cities had 5G before now, some in 2019.It’s strange a phone that came out just a couple of months ago, August 2020, doesn’t have 5G capability.That’s why I note it “meet’s your everyday needs… for now.” In a couple years, anyone who can is better off getting a better phone that does have 5G support.Another minor annoyance is this “at a glance” widget.It shows up at the top of the home screen and it can not be removed… The only option is a new app launcher.Someone noted to use Nova in one message board. That’s what I use, and I changed the settings so it is the default.Now, my home screen is blank and free for me to add only the items I want.I shouldn’t have needed to add a new app launcher.

Google's customer support is the worst I have ever dealt with,"My wife bought the 4a directly from the Google store.After about three months, there was purple bleeding that started appearing all over the screen.The phone still functions but you couldn't see anything besides purple shades.My wife contacted support and was told to send it in and it would be fixed under warranty.<br>However, after they received it they went back on the warranty coverage.They said the phone screen was cracked (the phone has been in a case and has a screen protector).In the initial call to support we had sent photos of the phone to show the screen issue, none of which show any kind of screen crack.My wife requested photos of the cracked screen to which out agent ""Irene"" would not provide as it is in a different department.Irene then told us she would call back after a day or two to help further resolve the issue.After a few days we don't hear back so again we call in.The next agent can't do anything because it is Irene's case.We ask for a supervisor to which we are told they are in a meeting.We request a call back from a supervisor and are told to expect a call within 24-48 hours.Instead of calling us back Irene send us an email saying we have til the 16th to decide what we want to do, phone returned to us more damaged than before or pay for a new screen.We respond to the email that we were originally told it was covered by warranty and have had a very frustrating experience and we would like to get a call back from a supervisor.Again, Irene goes silent and doesn't respond.We receive no call backs as promised so we call in again the next day.Same story different day,supervisor is in a meeting and will call back in 24-48 hours.In summary: This is a decent phone for the price as long as it is working.Not sure if the screen bleeding is a unique issue or widespread.If you ever have to contact customer support prepare yourself for one of the worst experiences as most of the agent just repeat ""Sorry you are experiencing this issue, let me see what I can do to help"" while proceeding to do absolutely nothing about it.</br>",2020年11月13日 在美国审核

Past it's Prime,"During a recent security update, my 8 month old Pixel 4a ($275) died. It could not see the sim card anymore. After 4 grueling hours in Google's warranty claim labyrinth, I finally had an appointment with u-break-we-no-fix. The guy at the counter says, I have a hairline crack that voids the warranty.Of course that is not true as the warranty specifically states: ""If, in addition to a defect covered by this Limited Warranty, your Google Product also has damage which is not covered (for example, damage caused by normal wear and tear or misuse by you) then Google is only responsible for addressing the defect covered by this Limited Warranty"".The good news is that I now have a decent pixel 4a webcam and a brand new Galaxy A53 5G ($349). The difference in these two phones is astounding. Just the Dolby Atmos sound alone is worth the A53 price of admission.The pixel phone quality was iffy at best. I used to get lots of sound breaks during my calls. It could be the difference between LTE and 5G, but the A53 is noticeably clearer and no drop outs so far. my 5G download speed is 300 Mb/s versus 45 Mb/s on pixel. Upload is 50 Mb/s versus 5 Mb/s. Camera on A53 is 64 MP versus 12 MP for pixel. Battery is 5000 mAh versus 3140 for Pixel 4a.You get the idea.

"Completely unreliable, time consuming, poor customer service","The Pixel ""a"" series of phones seems like a great deal, delivering an excellent camera at an excellent price. Unfortunately, they are too good to be true - the quality and reliability are so compromised that I can't tolerate them any more. I previously had the 3a, and that screen cracked 3 times on me - no other smart phone screen has ever cracked for me. After the third ruined screen, I replaced it with the 4a.The 4a's SIM card reader broke in less than a year. I tried replacing the SIM card but the phone remained nonfunctional - meaning the phone, messages, and mobile data don't work (although it's still a computer that works over WiFi). I ordered a replacement under warranty, and Google - get this - shipped it GROUND from Chicago to California. It took a week to arrive. And when the replacement arrived, it lasted less than a day. The replacement phone got stuck in boot mode as soon as I transferred my data (the picture), and I can't even perform a factory reset. I contacted support, and they can't factory reset the phone either.Now I want to return the replacement phone, and Google is refusing to provide a shipping label to return the broken phone until they receive and process the original phone. So that would be an additional 2-week delay if we go through returning the original phone, processing it, returning the replacement phone, and shipping a new one. I'd be out of a phone for 3 weeks.Anyway, no more Pixels for me - apparently the cheap price reflects such cheap components that the phones aren't reliable, and I need to have a working phone.NOTE: After a request to escalate the problem, multiple weeks, lots of emails, and two separate shipments for returns, Google fully refunded me for the original phone. I believe this is over and above what the warranty required, and so I've upgraded from 1 to 3 stars.",2021年1月29日 在美国审核

Meh,"I have owned an original first generation pixel, a pixel 3 xl, and a pixel 4 (which i broke and replaced with this 4a). This is honestly the first pixel that I have been somewhat disappointed with, although the $350 price tag definitely tempers my disappointment.I use a liquid glass screen protector and the official Google fabric case and I honestly have zero real complaints about the build quality. The screen is great, the buttons are tactile and responsive, the fingerprint reader is amazing, and the camera is excellent as usual. Phone speakers kind of suck but who really cares.My big complaint is the software, it's often gummy and unresponsive. Apps will occasionally freeze, and sometimes touch screen controls become unresponsive or buggy while using an app. This doesn't happen very often, maybe once every week or two, but when it does happen it really pisses me off. I had problems like this happen for like a week on my pixel 3 xl before it was fixed with a software update. It's been a problem for like 6 months with my 4a and it still happens.All together though, if you're looking for a sub-$400 phone the 4a is probably pretty hard to beat, just be prepared for the phone to crash and require a restart maybe once every two weeks.",2021年4月28日 在美国审核

"Fast, but fragile and runs hot","Bought this just a few months ago. Out of the box it was great - fast and smooth, and quite like and compact. I really like phones that can be operated one-handed, and don't sit in your pocket like a brick.But there are compromises, a couple of which I knew going in. Light means a small battery, but I wasn't prepared for how quickly this phone burns power. Literally burns - the phone runs hot, even while web surfing, and heat means power consumption. Was not looking forward to the heat degradation on the battery over the next couple years.I am a heavy user (including lots of hotspot) but I came from a string of Moto G models with similar batteries, and wasn't having to do a mid-afternoon recharge with those.One more luxury you get with Moto phones is splash resistance, which this doesn't have. No actual problems with this, but the added caution made this a less than carefree experience.What finally did it in was a cracked screen. Dropped on a kitchen tile floor. Even in the usual TPU rubber case, the bottom half of the screen spider webbed. Still usable (writing this review on it) but it's days are numbered. I've had my last 5 phones in rubber cases, with similar drops, and this never happened.TLDR, a small fast sports car of a phone. But fragile. Back to Moto G!",2021年10月3日 在美国审核

"Great camera, but small size not good for me, 'touchy' camera screen","I wanted a better camera than my previous android and this one is great. However, when in camera mode the screen is too 'touchy' - when taking a still pic, the slightest 'graze' of my finger somehow triggers it into video mode. Maybe it's just because it's such a small phone. As an 'old guy' with reading glasses, I bemoan this current fad aspect ratio of 19 - 9, seems pointless, makes the usable screen smaller. I don't stream movies, play video games, apps etc. I'm strictly Phone, Text and Camera, so all the bells and whistles mean nothing to me, I turn off most of the 'lifestyle crap'. The build quality seems good, but I've only had it for a week. Screen is sharp, but again, a bit small for me. Hopefully Google will eventually make more of a 'Phablet' for us old guys.

it's okay at best,"I had a pixel 3a that started having too many issues to have it be worth holding onto (charge port, screen, etc) and figured the 4a would be a good upgrade. I was wrong on that.The phone itself seems great on the surface - fast SOC, no bloatware, that prized Google camera software, android updates for years to come...what could go wrong? Pretty much everything.I bought the phone through Best Buy, and right out of the box the thing was creaky. I couldn't press the power button or adjust volume without the thing making noises.No big deal, I thought, so I ran back to the store and managed to get an exchange. Unit number 2 had the same exact issue but worse. I had to go back, yet again, and get a third phone. All in one day. Guess what? This one is creaky too. If I wanted to hear that 24/7 I would have bought a house built in 1890.Whatever plastic they used to make the 3a is long gone, this thing feels like a cheap toy in comparison. The screen is good, but at what cost? A chunk in the corner is dedicated to the camera. Gross.Software? You would think that something designed by the company that makes the software and OS would have a handle on things. Ha. I have to reset the phone almost daily because apps will auto-crash upon opening them. I do not install that many apps on my phone - I've installed a grand total of 4. But it's nice, I'm sure it's a feature. I bet that Google added that on purpose in hopes of reducing screen time. It's wonderful when I need to check something in a pinch.I sold it at a huge loss. Guess what? The person I sold the three day old phone for 200 dollars sold it to someone else after a day. The cycle continues.Do yourself a favour and skip this one unless you like wasting money.

NEVER buy a Google phone.,"I bought this phone in June 2021. By August of this year, my phone stopped working. I couldn't get the phone to turn on or do anything. I found the website for google warranty and sent a message to get my phone fixed because they don't have a direct phone number for you to contact. They called me and we began trying troubleshooting to figure out if we could get it working, and we couldn't. They told me I had to take it to ubreakifix before I was allowed to send it back to Google to look at( closest was an hour drive and I have three toddlers). I took it there and they cracked the bezel trying to see what the problem was. The motherboard was completely fried and google wouldn't ship him that motherboard because they had a shortage or something with that one type. He said he would have fixed the bezel but it was pointless when I had to send it in to Google to get a new motherboard. I contacted google and told them everything immediately, and started the process to get the packing sent to me so I could mail the phone in and not be held liable if something happened in transit. I mailed it in and received an email a week later telling me that the screen was broken and wouldn't make phone calls and they wouldn't fix it, but I could buy a refurbished phone instead from them. I contacted them yet again and stated that the phone wasn't damaged before I shipped it besides the bezel and that I wanted this looked in to because I wasn't going to be held responsible to buy a refurbished phone when that's not why I sent my phone in. They needed to have my repair order from ubreakifix in order to look in to my claim. They would not answer the phone, e mail or text and they were never open to get such repair order number. Finally after 4 hours on the phone with the corporate ubreakifix we got the repair number. I sent that in and waited for the specialist on my case to contact me. And waited. And waited. I am not sure what there was to figure out? Plain and simple what happened and documented phone calls and emails. Finally recieved an email saying they wouldn't repair my screen because it wasn't documented that there was damage done to it ( in the mean time my not fixed phone was mailed back to me with a perfectly intact screen besides the bezel). I called livid, not sure why they weren't replacing my phone. They said I couldn't talk to the specialist because the specialist couldn't communicate by phone, only email. So here I am two and a half months later, pissed off, and still have no new phone or my phone fixed when it is supposed to be under warranty for an entire year. Don't buy from Google, they don't uphold their warranty and make everything literally as difficult as they can.

Worthy phone but not worth upgrading,I bought this from Google and traded in my 3A for $120. This is a fine phone for the price but if you have a 3A you might consider holding off. This has a larger screen in a smaller body but with a different aspect ratio you don't gain much in display area. You do gain double the amount of storage but that is good only if you need it. There is more memory (6G vs 4G) so that could be a factor in operating speed and convenience but I don't see that right now.

Very disappointed,"Full disclosure, I did not but from Amazon. I bought new from Best Buy. I chose this phone because it was a Google and the price was right. I loved my 3 year old Google phone but the battery was dying quickly so when I decided to replace it I wanted another Google. I am a 60 year old non techie. I don't understand all the features that come on the phone. I use it to make calls, text, check email and Facebook.My biggest disappointment is the battery life. It is no better than my 3 year old phone. I had my son who is a computer programmer, check for anything running in the background. There was very little that should drain the battery so quickly. The other issue I am having is when I go to make a call it says it's calling, but sometimes I have to wait 30 or more seconds before it actually rings. When I turn off the phone to reboot it, it can take over 1 1/2 minutes after hearing the turn on Google sound before I can use the phone and it's not because it is updating. Bottom line, I would not purchase this phone again. Just a quick example I unplugged the phone and didn't use it at all. I put it in my purse and drove my son to school. By the time I got home, about 10minutes, it went from 100% to 98%. In the time it took me to type this review on my phone, my battery life went from 98% to 83%.",2021年10月26日 在美国审核
THIS IS THE WORST PHONE EVER MADE.,"Ya'll HAVE to be getting paid to write these good reviews because this phone is the worst, most awful ""smart"" phone around. I didn’t purchase this phone from amazon, I actually got it from my carrier (Verizon) but am writing a review on here because if you’re like me you read amazon reviews before purchasing things even if not from amazon themselves.<br>I don’t even know where to start. This phone has been complete C R A P from the beginning. The first week I had it, it glitched out so hard IT DELETED EVERYTHING I HAD BACKED UP when it automatically tried to update from android 10 to 11. Wow, thanks a lot. Thank goodness I had auto sync from my previous pixel 2 turned on and it had about 90% of my items saved but still, the 10% (oh yeah that was ALL OF MY TEXT MESSAGES with scheduling dates, phone numbers and addresses that I needed to get in touch with clients at a later date) wasn't recoverable at all. Really made me look unprofessional having to get back in touch with all of my clients, asking them to resend me the information they had previously sent. Also that didn’t include the people I couldn’t remember so… I had some missed appointments WHICH COST ME TIME AND MONEY, really really awesome, great job google. Now I paid for this terrible piece of technology in addition to missed appointments fees, GLAD THATS WHAT MY SAVINGS IS GOING TO, THANKS SO SO MUCH. NOW I CANT AFFORD TO EVEN GET A PHONE THAT CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO.Moving on. We called verizion, they couldn’t figure it out so they sent me an entirely new phone. I figured its a 4”a” maybe there are still some bugs; technology isn’t perfect, stuff happens, whatever, I’ll try this again with a new phone I guess. Really don’t have any other options considering I had just spent my money on late/missed appointments and this awful phone.JOKE WAS ON ME, the second phone was JUST as bad. My boyfriend is pretty tech savvy and did some research and found that other users on a reddit forum were having similar problems and that it was an error with the new android 11 operating system, so when we got my new 4a, we didn’t update the software and kept it on the 10 operating system. Was okay for a while but after about a week the screen started freezing up, locking the screen on whatever I was doing. None of there buttons would work so I just held down the power button until it eventually turned off. I don’t use my phone for much, just simple communication and basic social media. I don’t have any games, editing apps or anything crazy, literally just social media apps/email and you cut video editor. My phone has never been exposed to any crazy elements, I’ve never dropped it, it’s never gotten wet, too hot or too cold; I take exceptional care of my electronics because I’m not trying to pay the ludicrous amount they charge for phones these days more than I have to. I take photos and text people on it, thats literally it. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.We updated the system after a week or so because leaving it on 10 was just not working. As soon as we updated it to 11, what do you know?! ISSUES EVERYWHERE ALL THE TIME!!!! I really don’t understand it at all. I’m super super super super disappointed I bought this POS. Should have gone with a “whole” pixel, not some stupid “a” version. Every. Single. Time. I want to use my bluetooth, it NEVER remembers any devices, except for my car somehow? If I want to connect it to one of the google speakers we have, or stream anything, I have to completely forget the device entirely that I’m trying to connect to, EVEN THOUGH IVE CONNECTED TO IT 20+ TIMES, restart my phone, turn the bluetooth on, “search for a new device” go through all of those motions, then it works. EVERY TIME I want to use the bluetooth, this is the ONLY way it will work. It freezes up and I have to restart it just about every single day. It constantly disconnects from my headphones so I can’t use it to listen to music…. I got new Sony earbuds as a gift which are really amazing but I can’t really use them since I have to go through the described process above to connect to even be able to use them, then, it usually disconnects from the headphones after about 20 minutes, for no reason. I feel so silly getting so upset over something like this but I’m not exactly wealthy and don’t have time or money to waste on stupid crap this “smart” phone is doing that literally any other phone could do. I am die hard google supporter, apple isn’t my jam but I am considering switching after this phone, this is such a load of baloney, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY OR ENERGY ON THIS USELESS PHONE, buy a full pixel or don’t get any version of it al all. I’m 1000000000000000000% disappointed that google would release such terrible product, I hate this phone, I really do. I wish I could afford to get a full pixel but I guess I’lljust have to wait. I would rate this product negative -10 stars if possible, this is such a sham/joke DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!</br>",2020年12月21日 在美国审核

Do not buy,"Pros:-high pixel density display-Google account management/no Apple ID bs-Fingerprint reader faster than iPhone 7Cons:-utterly insane quantity of ads. What you are buying here is the right to use Google services directly, with no hope of avoiding their highest possible quantity of ads, short of rooting the phone, which obviously compromises security. Above all else, this is an advertising device, and it should be free of initial cost for that reason. Google makes 80% of their revenue from ads. I assume 80% of that 80% is directly sucked from the bloodstream of the 1,500 sorry sods that own this phone.-Camera is bad. Blurry image quality (think iPhone 4-5) and the worst focus / light balance / color balance of any phone I've ever used.-full Google bloatware suite-touchscreen constantly registers false touches, which renders multiple functionality completely inaccessible for &gt;50% of the time, including pinch-zooming and typing. It's a well known problem. Google knows about it, but has never commented. We know they know, because if you look this problem up on the Google support forum, you'll find many threads where people start discussing the problem, and the thread is locked as soon as forum admins find it. Many people say it's because of the low quality of display - the display of the Pixel 4a will often have glue leak onto the toushcreen, which is kind of like having someone put their finger on your screen about half the time.-Screen sucks. Despite high pixel density and good actual screen image, the screen sucks. It has an incredibly thin glass panel that breaks at the slightest shock. Drop it from waist level and watch it turn into a safety hazard quickly.-Short battery life, always dead by the end of the day if I don't charge it, and I don't use my phone frequently or watch videos often.I hate this thing. Truly the worst phone I have ever used, it makes me pine for my ad-free Cricket flip phone experience. Amazon already deleted this review once, I assume because a Google admin found my review and reported me. If you're reading this... take your $450 and go buy a refurbished iPhone. Don't buy this piece of garbage ad revenue harvester masquerading as a phone.As of 2021, Google gets &gt;80% of revenue from advertising. If you'd like to know how that's possible in a world of adblockers, buy this phone.~4-5 ads per 10 minute youtube video. Not kidding.",2021年5月10日 在美国审核
"Good device, poor support.","Overall I WAS very pleased with my device, until the fingerprint reader stopped working in one day. Google recommended I take it to ubreakifix to have it repaired under warranty. I did this but two days after receiving it back I picked it up from charging and the screen came off. I took it back to the repair shop who insisted they had to wipe the device in order to fix the SCREEN. It takes hours to switch devices due to some unique apps I have , so I contacted Google about getting an advanced replacement. They said twice that they would do it, but each time failed to follow through saying they couldn't get it done because I hadn't bought it from the Google store.If you don't have any hardware issues you will likely be happy with the device. If you do don't count on Google to do much for you.",2020年10月16日 在美国审核

Look at the screen from the bottom up horizontally, you’ll see some devices are slightly twisted. Google made a mistake with the plastic encasing. To add, why produce three phones the same year?

Decent and affordable but feels cheap,I don't have any big gripes about it but I don't really like the phone. I used to have a lg v30 and loved it but they stopped giving it security updates so I retired it. Similar fingerprint location. I use a custom launcher but the ui is good.Camera is fine and in line with other phones of all prices albeit one lens.The screen makes this a 3 star phone. I didn't think I would mind it but slightly bigger and more resolution is missed from my old phone.Not a bad phone just not anything special.

Exceptional phone for the price,"I had this phone for a few days and I just got to say, the hole punch is great. It's unobtrusive and way better than the notch or iPhone SE 2020 bezels if you want to stream content. The night mode is exceptional, and the photo quality is excellent. The only caveat is that it uses an old photo sensor so when you zoom in, there is a bit of noise. This is just nitpicking but the camera is perfect for only $350. Picture quality retains much of the color as well. The phone is also relatively snappy with zero lag. Not as fast as the SE's A13 but it very well gets the job done.Gaming is also fine on this phone. You should probably play medium to low graphics with this mid-range processor. I tested Asphalt 9 and WOT Blitz, and these games run very smoothly on this phone. I experienced no lags and stutters. If you want high frame rates at the highest settings, you should look elsewhere.Now onto battery life. This phone charges around an hour and 15 mins with its supplied 18-watt charger. For me, the phone barely lasted a day, but since I'm at home all day, I don't think that my usage is an accurate representation of the general public. Most people would be FINE with 1 charge/day. No complaints here.Now here's the kicker: you get unlimited high-quality photo storage on Google photos + 128 GB of internal memory. Now that's one hell of a deal! Unless you are a heavy mobile gamer, this is the phone for you.

The absolute BEST phone you can by right now!,"*If you don't want to read my entire review, here is the summary: The Google Pixel 4a is the BEST phone you can buy right now for almost everyone. For $349 it's a NO BRAINER.*I have used several Android phones (including flagship ones that cost $900+) and I've also used an iPhone. But this Pixel 4a is the absolute best overall experience I've ever had with any phone. I'm a tech guy for a living, so I needed a phone that could do everything and do it well, this phone more than delivered! Did I mention it's ONLY $349?Below is a pros and cons list I've made for potential buyers. I hope you find it helpful!Pros: Fully unlocked so it will work with EVERY SINGLE carrier in the USA (As well as many outside the US), HUGE amount of built in storage of 128GB, plenty of RAM at 6GB, a fast and energy efficient processor (SD 730G), a bright and beautiful 5.8 inch display (OLED at 1080p+ resolution), a headphone jack! (For those of us who still prefer a wired connection), a decent sized battery (3100+ mah) that gives you all day battery with moderate to heavy use, fast charging included in the box (18W) you get from empty to 100% in about an hour and a half, with close to 50% after 20 mins give or take, dual stereo speakers that sound great, a very good hapitic feedback engine when you type, a phenomenal front and rear camera (literally the best camera on any Android phone), really premium feeling polycarbonate (plastic) body, really sturdy and clicky buttons, and the absolute best software experience by Google with at least 3 major Android OS upgrades in the future.Cons: No water or dust proofing, no wireless charging, only available in Just Black color, no 5G support, limited case selection (As of right now but that will change in the future).Overall, the experience of using this phone is fast, fluid, and enjoyable. The screen is bright and almost edge to edge, it's the perfect size for one handed use, the Pixel version of Android is light and easy to use and has many really good exclusive features like ""Now playing"" and ""Live transcribe"" as well as many more new features to come with the newest version of Android and security patches being pushed out directly from Google to their Pixel line of phones. It offers unmatched support and longevity for Android updates and security patches.I've had this phone for several days and it's my daily driver, I have had no issues or complaints with it at all. The battery life is great, it's super fast and smooth, it doesn't slow down or stutter when I use multiple apps at a time, it doesn't close my apps down in the background too quickly, and it's the perfect size for my hands and pockets. What else can I say? You don't need to spend $900+ to get a really good phone! Just spend $349 and get this phone! You won't regret it.",2020年8月25日 在美国审核

This is the best phone I’ve ever had!,"First off, I just wanna say that this view is from the point of view of an AVERAGE BUYER. All the reviews by people who review phones for a living are not accurate for someone like me to decide if I want to purchase this phone. These people are way harsher than the average smartphone buyer! Some people say this is a “budget” phone, but this is the most expensive phone I’ve ever owned. A lot of thought went into buying it, and I’m so glad I did!Camera: WOW. Just wow! This camera has the cleanest and sharpest image I’ve ever seen in person on a smartphone.I’m attaching some of my favorite photos it’s taken. So much DETAIL!! I included some photos of my dog and cat because I absolutely LOVE the amount of detail. And one photo of people to see how the selfies look!!Battery life: this phone’s battery life is very impressive. I usually only charge my phone over night so it’s ready to go the next day. I have owned this phone for almost 4 months and I have yet to charge it more than once in a 48 hour span. And the charger that comes with it charges my phone SO FAST. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.Size: I absolutely love how much smaller this phone is compared to the past 4 phones I owned! It’s still a decent size but it actually fits in my jeans pocket. The screen size makes up for it because it takes up literally the entire front of the phone.Overall: I know this review lacks a lot of key features for this phone and it definitely doesn’t do it justice.

This is one of the only budget phones that has night mode which beats the more expensive SE that doesnt have it.Speakers - At this price, you wouldn't expect the speaker to sound. Believe it or not, the stereo speaker sounds pretty good. Mids are decent, bass are present. Microphone also works great.Cons: No wireless charging. That's it. That's the only con.Other than that, this phone is suitable for those looking for phones thats geared towards value. If you are a student, this phone is for you.",2020年9月13日 在美国审核
It's just okay. I would pass on this one.,"Okay, I'm switching from a Redmi note 8 pro to the google pixel 4a. I have mixed feelings about this device. I'll get to the picture part at the end. This device is small. Iphone 6s is about the same size both in length and width. It feels super cheap. Like a prepaid phone that costs $80 dollars at your local walgreens. The interface is not snappy and quick like the YouTube reviewers say it is. It is average. My budget Redmi note 8 pro costs 200 dollars less than this device and it's a better experience. I found the fingerprint reader doesn't always work, when it works it feels like ages to actually unlock. The same thing with entering a pin. It feels like it takes a long time to actually unlock. Who is this phone for? Someone who isn't really on a phone all the time, it's not a powerhouse scrolling Instagram is okay YouTube is okay, the small display is just a let down. I don't know what model the youtubers are showing you because this device is small. Like really small. Like this would be fine for a child. Okay the camera. Beautiful pictures in good light, okay pictures in really low light, now comes the bad part about the camera. In areas that have light but it's not dark enough for night mode the pictures come out noisy and grainy. Like indoors at 4 pm. For $350 I strongly recommend a Xiaomi device. Or step up to the google pixel 5.",2020年10月31日 在美国审核

Great phone with just a few compromises,"I bought this phone because I wanted the nicest lightest android phone possible since I have a muscle issue and can't hold heavy phones in certain circumstances and it has been really hard to find a light phone that offers good performance and a nice display until this phone came out, of course with a few compromises!I love the display and that this phone has a fingerprint sensor even though I would have so much preferred if the fingerprint sensor was incorporated under the display like the other flagships even if it was going to increase the price a little bit. The material is not the best quality but that's a compromise I have to make to get a light-weight phone.I wish they had added wireless charging capability though, it wouldn't have made the device much more expensive and it would have made it so much easier for me to charge the phone in the car or on a wireless charging stand.Overall it's a great phone for the weight and for the price; there're definitely some compromises and some areas that can be improved but hopefully these will be address in the newer model when it comes out.",2021年6月10日 在美国审核

The Best in Mid-Class Smart Phones.,"Here are the ""good"" and ""bad"" on this product..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.ADVANTAGES.1. This is the highest rated mid-class smart phone by critics and professional evaluators. Read their views on the internet. Almost all have praises for its price and features..2. The screen resolution is sharp. You can see small items in detail and without the blur..3. The price was $350. I got mine for $263, a customer return - new but in an opened box and fingerprints on the screen..4. The camera features are found in +$1,000 smart phones..5. The built-in Google Assistant is a ""life saver."" If you do not know what to do or in trouble, ask: ""Hey Google, xxxxxxxxxx."".6. The 6GB RAM enables smooth and quick operations. The user is also able to load numerous apps and have them waiting in the background..7. Google quality is below Apple. So, it is much better than all other competing brands..8. Two speakers produce stereo sound and music..--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.DISADVANTAGES.1. Gorilla 3 screen is inferior to the recent Gorilla 5..2. Fingertip scanner did not work. During installation, it could not scan my prints after numerous tries..3. On the bottom of the screen, the device lacks the three familiar screen navigation icons: triangle, circle, and square..4. Battery was too small..5. The 128GB Data storage is built-in. As a result, the user is not able to upgrade or exchange storage chips..6. There is no user guide. The buyer has to consult the internet for information. Better still, go to YouTube and see video clips. One in particular has 1.5 minute films on important features. Step-by-step directions are easy to understand and execute.",2021年8月26日 在美国审核

It was a little difficult adjusting I even got to the point where I planned on returning it but figured I'd give it a couple more days of use.I'm certainly glad I kept this phone I myself consider it a little powerhouse, I've read bad reception on this phone and all I can say is I use mine in a hospital setting as well as on elevators and do not lose reception at all.Even though this phone has no IP rating I've watched some videos where they have dunked this phone in water for over an hour plus with no damage or stoppage in the phone. This is something of course I wouldn't suggest doing.In my closing to this feedback once again all I can say is I'm more than happy with this phone and this is the first Google pixel I've used and very happy once again I never sent it back",2021年2月5日 在加拿大审核
El mejor celular del momento,"El mejor celular que he tenido y enumero porqué:- El tamao ideal, no demasiado pequeo (por el increíble aprovechamiento de pantalla) ni tan grande para que pese, estorbe o sea poco manejable.- El pixel con la mejor calidad/precio, ya tuve un pixel 3a y a comparación de éste la calidad se apreciaba peor (la pantalla de me estrelló de iba caída menor) y el rendimiento dejaba que desear.- Una excelente calidad de sonido, quizás solo algo bajo pero se percibe de excelente calidad.- El performance es muy bueno, a pesar de que no tiene el mejor procesador, hasta ahora no se me ha congelado.- Y lo mejor al final: La cámara, la mejor cámara del mundo pegada a un celular que cuesta la mitad de un iPhone wana ve.No me arrepiento de comprarlo, definitivamente el mejor celular del momento (el 4a 5g se perfila para quitarle el lugar pero en México aún no hay cobertura por lo que... meh)",2020年10月14日 在墨西哥审核

"Fast, light  easy to use - better than Samsung","Don't get me wrong - Samsung makes fine products but I was really tired of the duplication and silly Bixby stuff. Sure you can try and turn off Bixby (because it's useless) but once in a while you either hit the wrong button or a Samsung update causes you to re-activate it.Couple this with the Samsung browser no thanks have Chrome, Samsung contacts - no thanks have Google contacts, Samsung gallery, no thanks have Google photos.BUT the most annoying feature was the inability to easily turn ring volume up separately from media volume. On the Pixel just hit the volume up or down and a menu appears, hit the little slider icon and you can change volume for all types of things.The phone is fast, light and the camera is fantastic - the built in spirit level to the camera interface is great - makes you get perfectly level photos all the time.",2021年2月23日 在加拿大审核

El equipo en mano es fácil de manipular, es muy cómodo.En el apartado auditivo, a pesar de tener sonido estéreo no es la mejor calidad que puedes encontrar, le falta volumen y al volumen máximo distorsiona.En cuanto a autonomía de la batería solo les hizo falta agregar más mA, eso porque estoy acostumbrado a los típicos 4000mA de los gama media.En conclusión el equipo es bueno, rinde lo que debe rendir para su gama.",2020年10月24日 在墨西哥审核

Pretty good phone,"I purchased this phone as replacement for my old phone (Xperia XA1, released in 2017, ~C$330), and used about 1 month.Display : Large, bright and beautiful.

I mainly use web browser, mail, maps, SNS apps, YouTube and so on (light apps only). I don't play heavy apps like game on this smartphone. So I can't say whether this phone is good for playing game or not. When I used Xperia XA1, displaying photo took several seconds. However, this Pixel 4a can show everything quickly.Storage : 128GB is large enough for me, difficult to use up all.Camera : Can take beautiful pictures. Video is also very good. ""Astrophotography mode"" can take photos of night skies. I used this function in Vancouver, BC, Canada (look at the photo I posted). ... Not bad for a smartphone camera. But I felt it is difficult to take a beautiful photo of the milky way as found on google image search. Maybe because light pollution in Vancouver is terrible.Battery life : Battery lasts long enough.Fingerprint reader : The sensitivity of the reader is good. The reader is placed on the rear of the phone. I don't think this position is good. I sometimes mistakenly touched the sensor when I picked up my phone.Appearance : Mat black body looks nice. The surface is a bit slippery. Recommend to use a case.Price : I paid C$543 (C$479.99 + TAX). I felt this price was a bit expensive for my use. If the price were C$443, I would have been satisfied perfectly.",2021年1月30日 在加拿大审核

Great camera but...,I bought this phone for its camera. I don't use it as a phone. The camera lived up to my expectations. But after 3 months I had problems. The fingerprint wouldn't work and I could not access the GooglePlayStore for more apps.After a chat with Google the chat person said to factory reset it. I did this reluctantly even after she told me all my data would be saved. IT WASNT so I lost it all and it didn't solve the print or playstore problems. Next day after 3 hours of more chat and futile tests with Google they agreed to send me a replacement if I send this one back. So I have and I hope the new one (may be refurbished..ugh!) will perform better. Overall it's a good device and the photos are excellent. Doesn't integrate well with my Apple Mac and iPod tho. But for its general ability its a good device. Don't know about how it is an actual phone.,2021年6月12日 在加拿大审核

No es como lo pintan,"Tiene el mismo rendimiento que un teléfono del tercio de su precio.La pantalla refleja colores molestos, nunca la verás blanca al 100% y es que no es IPS.Los altavoces se saturan con volumen alto.Su sistema es muy limitado y nada personalizable, solo emite pantalla a una Android TV y tienes que descargar apps para todo, por ejemplo para tener un simple ecualizador, o radio, o galería local de fotos.Además su cámara, cambia los colores y no puedes configurar ningún balance, sólo es nítida.Por todo eso no lo vale, afortunadamente puede devolverlo sin problema, así que volvería a comprar a SHOP4YOU pero nunca más un Pixel",2021年8月1日 在墨西哥审核

Mixed review - Avoid buying for these important reasons,"Pros first:1) Very handy - If you don't like 6' phones this is the one.2) Needless to say - great Camera.3) Great build quality.Cons:1) Screen touch became unresponsive after ~5 months which is ok, gadgets get issues, but the bigger problem is Google has not provided good repair/service options, I was told repair would take 9-12 business days. There is only one service centre(centralised service centre in Mumbai it seems) There are no partner/authorised service centre in Bangalore. How can one be without phone for so many days!2) Not my word but Pixel is known for so many bugs - I experienced myself. Android Auto doesn't work as expected.3) Its not very convenient. Samsung provides lots of useful features on top of stock Android OS which makes life easy.4) Power &amp; Volume buttons are noisy.For reason like no good service support I would not recommend anyone to buy Google phones! until they provide service/service partners in big cities at least.",2022年6月8日 在印度审核

Researched like crazy to buy this phone....not let down.,"Had it for like four days. Previous phone was an HTC 8x from T-Mobile.Okay, I was running on an Alcatel one touch evolve for the past 3 months since my 8x decided to brick on me....I researched all the possible unlocked 'budget phones' I could get for a reasonable amount of money. I saw the moto g, the L90, the oneplus one, even an old S3. Then came along BLU.....the phone that intrigued me the most was the life 8 for its processor and nice specs....but then I heard about the studio 5.0c HD.....50$ less, slower processor but otherwise similar specs. I bought it expecting decent performance considering the lack of notoriety of the manufacturer. Boy was I wrong! This phone has excelled in practically everything I've thrown at it so far. Both cameras are light years away from any budget phone...the quad core processor works more than well with KitKat(I have not tried out games)...HSDPA speeds serve my social media needs just fine....and it came with a cool case, earphones and a workable screen protector. I don't think I could of thought of a better off contract 150$ phone. Thank you BLU....so far, of course.P.s. the only con that keeps it from being rated 5 stars is the battery life and facial unlock....other than those minor chinks....definitely a moto g killer.",2014年8月12日 在美国审核

High-End Device for Low Cost. Might As Well Be Carrying a Galaxy S5 or an LG G3.,"When I first read ""5.0-inch display"" I expected something as lightweight as the Nexus 5...THIS PHONE IS A BEHEMOTH. This is the biggest device I've had thus far. My previous phone, the BLU Life Play L100a, was a very good phone for its worth at $230 last year, but the Studio 5.0 C HD is WORLDS BETTER with an even cheaper retail price. Out of the box I was surprised to see the size of this phone. When you first hold it, it feels SOLID. Though its body is a hair smaller than LG's newest flagship, the G3, it does not overwhelm and actually fits very snugly in your pocket. There is nothing cheap or secondhand about this device except for its $149.00 price. BLU continued its generosity with a great set of earphones (with mic), a screen protector, a very nice silicone case, and an updated wall charger port + USB cord, now flat and slightly shorter than the Android standard.The phone only has three external buttons: power on the right side, and the volume rocker on the left (technically two buttons there). They are EXTREMELY sensitive and quick to respond. Just 3 days in, the phone has not lagged, or frozen, and it has handled some decent gaming with no problems whatsoever, INCLUDING battery life (during an hour of play the battery only decreased by 2%). Running the ""OK Google"" hotword detection does not drain much battery either, which was nice. The specs are worth far more than $150, but I don't think any of us would complain about that. The 8 MP camera might not seem like anything special, but the phone actually snaps more-than-decent photos. Poor lighting will affect its performance like any other camera, however, so be weary. The speed of its capture and HD recording are wonderful, as it runs 4.4.2 KitKat OS out of the box. Its stock Android experience is near-identical to Google's Nexus brand.COMMON QUESTIONS:- YES, it has a Notification Light.- YES, third-party headphones/earbuds work fine (my Maxell earbuds actually have better quality than the included BLU earbuds)- NO, it does not have Gyroscope, but it does have an Accelerometer.PROS:- Highly responsive- Impressive size and display: you might have bought a cheap phone, but it certainly won't look that way- Capable cameras- Quick to charge (INCLUDES A NOTIFICATION THAT TELLS YOU EXACTLY HOW LONG IT TAKES TO REACH 100%)- Stock 4.4.2 KitKat OS- Snappy speed: 1 GB RAM and 4 GB Memory are enough; you can always expand storage to 64 GB)- 2000mAh Li-Ion: Surprisingly good battery lifeCONS:- BLU DOES add a few extras in, so it isn't 100% stock Android.- Differs from its predecessors and other KitKat devices: no Notification toggle, no swipe for Google Now. This can be changed with KK Launcher from the Play Store.- Taking screenshots takes a hair longer on the Studio than other devices (MAYBE half-a-second longer)Buying this phone will not be a mistake. If you want something cheap that still puts you in the loop with the latest technology that Google and Android have to offer, this is the device for you!",2014年9月1日 在美国审核

Great Value!,"This is a great value for anyone wants the flexibility of a dual SIM phone, with premium hardware (a fast quad core chip, 1 GB of RAM, large hi res screen, nice camera, etc.), and the ability to subscribe with more than a dozen premium carriers, some of whom offer amazingly low rates if you aren't a data hog and your primary goal is making reliable phone calls and low cost internet access.The internal memory isn't much, but remember you have two cards.And its a good looking phone.Over time, and with some good targeted marketing, I would be surprised if these phones didn't capture a large part of the economy market.You don't want a long term commitment to a contract and/or an endless stream of outrageously priced, latest bling phones?The BLU Studio is the way to go.Same mini-USB power connection as most other phones.Battery comes out in case you want to carry more than one, or switch out an old one.See photo for accessories that came with mine.",2015年3月5日 在美国审核
Perfectly Adequate,"I mostly like this phone.It has many things in it's favor.<br>1.It's reasonably priced, so you don't have to spend a fortune if you want smartphone features without the hefty price tag2.The screen resolution is fabulous.I use this at the gym to watch videos and the processor is fast enough so there's no jerkiness and the picture is perfectly clear3.It is easy and intuitive to set up if you've ever set up a cell phone before.4.Call quality is good.I find the sound is better through a headset than placing the phone on your ear -- I think that ambient sound gets in the way without the headset, causing sound breaks.The negatives, though, balance out the positives1.It's bigger than I'd like -- but still smaller than my tablet, so it's easier to hold onto2.The battery life is not great.I know smartphones take more battery power the more you do with it, and you usually have to charge them daily...but really I think one should getmore than 5 hours of function out of it.Admittedly, it probably took a lot of juice being in constant use of setting it up and downloading apps, and watching video, but I charged it fully before setting up and got 3 hours of downloads, customizing, etc.Charged it overnight and then made 2 very short phone calls, did a couple of tweaks, read some email, watched about 20 minutes of video, listened to 15 minutes of music and then did some setting up of my contact list--all that gave me 5 hrs and 20 minutes of battery life.Hopefully, it will improve as I do less fussing.It would be a good idea to carry your charger or a power pack with you.I do more with my tablet and get a minimum of 10 hours in constant use--including videos and game playing.3. Some of my carefully placed icons disappear after the phone is turned off and then turned back on.This is an annoyance and I thought it was a fluke the first time it happened, but it happens consistently.4. They say it's 4G, but it's 4G HSA--which is really enhanced 3G.It is not true 4G, which would be 4G LTE.I would definitely give it 5 stars if not for the battery issue and the disappearing/reappearing icons-.</br>",2014年12月24日 在美国审核
Surprisingly Good,"After much deliberation, I finally decided on this phone. I was hesitant about buying a budget phone, but this phone doesn't feel like a budget phone at all.The screen is beautiful - as nice as my Sony Xperia TL or maybe even better! It feels solid and well built. The power and volume keys are very sensitive. I tend to brush up against them a lot,but that's just because my old phone was the exact opposite layout. I'll get used to it!At first, I was worried about the built in ROM space, but it turned out to be more than enough space for my apps. I just plugged in my 16GB memory card for music, photos, etc., and I was good to go!The back camera is much better than I expected.The color is pretty good, and the focus is fine. The front camera is a little disappointing, though. It's too contrasted and grainy, but that may be a setting that I have yet to discover.The call quality is terrific! The calls are clear and plenty loud on both ends of the call. The speaker is a bit tinny for my tastes (especially when listening to music) but pairing my blutooth speakers solved that problem.The phone has enough power to do everything I need to do. The 3g connection speed is enough for me, but if you spend a lot of time streaming videos or music without wifi, this might not be the phone for you.The battery does drain fairly quickly, so it probably wouldn't hurt to invest in some sort of backup battery.It's definitely an improvement over my (admittedly glitchy) Sony Xperia TL, but it certainly isn't a flagship phone either.Don't expect it to compare with something like a Galaxy class phone. For its price point, though, it's a great phone!",2014年12月13日 在美国审核
Good phone for a good price,"Out of the box, setting up the BLU phone was very easy.The instructions show you the location to press on the top of the phone to remove the back case.Once removed, you slide in a full-sized SIM card and battery, and then you put the case back on.You next turn on the phone, let it connect to the cell tower, and then finish the WIFI and other setup.I had no problem setting up this phone using ATT.Once it is setup, the phone is a generic Android 4.4 Kitkat release with no bloatware.The BLU also comes with its own phone cover that matches the color of the back of the phone.I observed that the color of photos taken with the camera need some color correction. The photos have more of a blue tinge than the subject I am taking a picture of. Overall it is a nice phone with a fairly large screen at a good price.",2014年9月13日 在美国审核
"For a budget phone, this is pretty amazing","I haven't used an Android phone in quite some time, since back when the OS was 2.3 in fact.The OS has come a long way and budget phones have come a long way, too.Here we have OS 4.4 and it works smooth and fast.The BLU is quite amazing for a budget phone.The screen is crisp, the apps run without a hitch, and it comes with everything you need, including a lightweight silicone case.Even the earbuds/mic set works well and the earbuds don't sound cheap at all.For me, this unit was entirely plug and play.I put in a T-Mobile SIM and a micro-SD storage device and I was ready to go.The camera provides crisp images, especially in HD mode, that are perfectly adequate.How long will this unit last?I have no idea, but given that people constantly lose phones or get them wet, not paying a whole lot for a phone is a good idea.I think this would be a perfect phone for a teen.It would also be great for international travel, since it comes with dual SIM capability.Light users will find this unit very capable as well.I can't get any better than 3G with this phone data-wise on T-Mobile so far, so if you're a data hog, that might be a limitation, but it isn't for me.Also, the battery drains quickly, much more quickly than on my iPhone, so that's a significant limitation.You'll have to charge this unit every day, maybe more often if you're a heavy user.Finally, during app downloads in the background, the machine slows down considerably for other uses.Other than those deficiencies, I'm very impressed with this machine.",2014年8月21日 在美国审核
Very Good Phone,"This is a good quality unlocked phone. I use it as an alternative to my regular ATT cell phone because of the size, camera and picture quality.My regular cell phone is a basic flip phone. It is small and sturdy and can take punishment andis great for making calls. It is convenient and works well for making and receiving calls.The Blu phone offers a lot of excellent features. It comes in a phone holder which holds the phone, earpiece, phone protector and charger.I like the fact that I have a place to store everything for this phone.This phone is a little over five inches high and three inches wide. It fits fine in a jacket pocket.When I want to use this phone I just take my sim card from my regular cell phone and put it in this one. It is easy to do. The sound quality is very good.This works well as a phone.I also have enjoyed listening to music with the earpiece.The picture quality superior.I have used this to take pictures both inside and outside and I am pleased with the results. I also have used this to access the internet and am pleased with the quality of the graphics as well.This phone can be used to access the internet even if it does not have a Sim card in it. I have used it in my home and at some coffee places justto access the web. I have big hands andfingers so typing text with my fingers is not so easy so I use a stylus pencil which works fine. The picture quality is very good.The battery life seems normal to me.Once low it seems to charge pretty quickly.It has some nice extrasinstalled like Google plus, a maps application, an FM radio as well as some other basic items but it is not overloaded with items taking up critical space.My one concern is that I have tried calling customer support three times to ask some questions about some of the features on this phone and I have been on hold over 20 minutes before I had to hangup because I don't have 20 minutes to waste on hold.Plus all I kept hearing was the same music over and over.This is a great unlocked phone. The sound and picture quality is very good and I have no problem accessing the internet with the phone.",2014年9月7日 在美国审核
The Chromebook of Phones??,"I think we'll call this the Chromebook of phones.Having just purchased this for my daughter we are very pleased with the phone and are using it on T-Mobile in Massachusetts.Typical buyer persona - If you but generic foods, shop at Marshalls or T.J. Maxx and like ""the look for less"", this just might be a phone for you. If you only buy new cars and need that special brand identity and constantly sync everything with iTunes then this isn't the phone for you.The net, net- Finally there is an off brand phone that works well. It's offers a pure Google-centric Android configuration without the additional ""branded"" elements and apps you get from other manufacturers.I work in mobile technology and own a Galaxy S5, my wife has the Note 2 and my daughter has an iPhone 5. This phone performs as well as our others if not faster and at $150 it doesn't make you feel like you'll cry if something happens to it. You also don't really need an insurance policy. Heck, you can replace it every year for the next four years and still be ahead vs purchasing an iPhone or new Galaxy.We purchased a white 5.0 C HD and the screen is big and beautiful. The HD video is great and the 8 megapixel camera is more than sufficient unless you want to take wall size images and print them out. The speeds on T-Mobile are similar to my S5 but the status bar reads 3g+. I could care less what it says on the status bar as long as it works fast.The only missing element in my mind is WiFi calling with T-Mobile (since that comes with the T-Mobile software they load on their branded phones). However, the wifi itself works very well. To replicate wifi calling one can always use Google Hangouts dialer found here:(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.hangoutsdialer)Ultimately this feels like the chromebook of phones. Why spend $2,000 on a MacBook Air when you can get a Chromebook for $250?. Why spend $700 on a new Samsung or iPhone when you can pocket the cash and get a low priced plan on T-Mobile and a phone that works great.",2014年9月28日 在美国审核

"Very solid phone, should be considered by almost anyone","This is a surprisingly nice phone.Obviously most of the world is talking about the iPhone 6 right now.I will not engage in the debate of iPhone versus droid here, just simply talk about this as a really nice phone for those seeking something different or who wish to avoid two year contracts.The moment you open the box and touch the phone you are struck by its high quality construction.It simply feels sturdy in your hand and solid.It is heavy, not so heavy you don't want to carry it, just solid.It has a great battery life, and comes, as you know with Kit Kat right out of the box.The storage is limited, but that can be quickly and almost completely addressed with the use of a card.My only issue is some apps will not run from the card, so that's frustrating.Overall, this is a great product, solidly built and you will be pleased with this purchase.",2014年9月23日 在美国审核
An inexpensive phone with great features,"This is not a quality built phone.The whole phone is made with plastic other than the screen.I gave it four stars for the features, price and size.Set up was easy.I inserted the AT&amp;T SIM card which I removed from another phone and the Blu phone recognized it right away.I also inserted a 32 gb micro SD card for additional storage.Since the phone case is plastic, you have to be careful not to crack the back case when you remove it for inserting the SD and SIM cards.The phone came with a thin clear protective case which I like.The screen protector which also came with the phone was easy to installed, I have no bubbles. I have not tried the earphone so I can't tell the sound quality.I will use my Shure or Kliscphe anyway.So, the phone came with everything that you need to protect the phone from being damage.The phone is very responsive.The screen resolution is very nice, almost Retina Display quality. The fact that it is a 5"" makes it very easy to read.I have a iPhone 5 as a company phone, I have a hard time reading from the small screen.The speaker is loud but not the best sound quality.The call quality is okay but could be louder.So, for $150, it is a phone with great features and screen resolution.The fact that is no contract is even better.For those of you who don't mind locking in to a 2year contract, a Samsung or iPhone is definitely a better quality phone.I also noticed the back case comes off very easily when you remove the case protector which means, it has very poor water resistance value.So, make sure you don't drop the phone in water or expose it in the rain.I know some reviewers claimed that they have hard time removing the finger prints off the screen.I have been carrying a small microfiber cleaning cloth to clean my glasses, smartphones and tablets and it works like a charm.Finger prints come right off.I also noticed a data plan has not been added to this phone yet which is a good thing as I have the data plan on the iPhone.I still able to get internet when wifi is available, big money saving there.Don't know if AT&amp;T will eventually tag on a data plan.I downloaded an off-line navigation app for use when I do not have internet.The navigation still works but you have to save it as a favorite in the app first.",2014年8月25日 在美国审核
Great Value For A Smartphone,"The 5.0 C HD Blu Studio Phone is a fairly good attempt at trying to achieve a lower cost yet powerful smartphone. Many of its features are fairly comparable to many phones on the marketplace currently that go for much higher cost out of the box (or spread over time via contractual obligations). My times with it, at least from a casual smartphone user standpoint, was that it is relatively fast and quick with its operating system, apps, and everything else under the hood. Coming from the standpoint of one who also uses asSony Xperia Z1s though, I found myself constantly wishing to use that phone instead of this one for a few days. Using that phone shows where this 5.0C has several weakness, the screen quality felt less sharp and spiffy on the 5.0C HD than on a TriLuminos Display for a mobile phone, though this is only apparently when one uses the other phone, but still it shows the 5.0C has taken a few liberties in going for a cost efficient display tech. In speaking of the display as well, when one uses the camera for the 5.0C there is this ghosting effect that seems present when swiftly moving the phone, when moving the phone in any degree with the camera there is a fairyly noticeable lag in the screen trying to catch up. Ive not noticed this effect in many other current phones too, so the camera is also another area where it seems they have taken some cost efficient liberties too. That isnt to say that the phone has a bad camera though as its probably unfair to compare this 8.0MP one to other 20.7MP and higher phones that go for hundreds of dollars more.All in all for a smartphone that does what every other modern smartphone can do under the hood, this blu studio phone is actually a great deal. One really wouldnt be using a smartphone as a camera substitute so an 8.0MP camera is a fairly good inclusion anyway. The screen is still 1080P HD display and offers a vibrant view when watching videos online and what not too, so it also isnt actually bad. This phone really only looks lacking when one compares it to other phones of 2013/2014.So for 150$ its actually amazing. I love all the built in sounds too, its random chimes, its inclusion of an FM radio tuner, headphones, 5 inch display, and at this time, the most current version of Android.Definitely the best deal for a phone that isnt over $200.",2014年9月12日 在美国审核
Excellent Value!!! Galaxy S5 and Iphone 5C had a Baby,"Background: I decided to purchase this phone after dropping and damaging the LCD on my LG G2 with T-Mobile. I don't have phone insurance, and I'm on a budget. I'm a tech savvy college student who has always been #teamandroid.Service: The phone DOES work with T-Mobile 4G speeds! I have a micro sim, but I just pushed and centered in the slot and it worked without an adapter.Looks/Size: HUGE, Bright, and fun. I loved the fact that this phone came in colors, and I love neon green/yellow and that's what I chose. It is bright like a highlighter and definitely turns heads. The edges are rounded and the phone is large. I have big hands, so I can comfortably hold it in one hand. I also bought the BLU hybrid case in neon so the color still matches and protects my phone.Cameras: The back camera is 8MP and is pretty good. Its not Galaxy S5 quality, but it takes clear photos. I recommend getting the Google Camera app from the Play Store. The front camera works great in lots of light, but can be iffy in low light, especially on snapchat where u can't immediately change the exposure. But over all good for only $120.Performance:1G Ram and 1.3GHz Quad-core. I run many apps at once, and this handles my multitasking well. There were a few force closes in the beginning, but then I updated all of my apps and that stopped. I've also installed many apps, I have the 8gb version, and there are no problems.Battery: I always have my charger at school because I heavily use this phone. But it will last all day (9-5) if you turn down the brightness, location off, close apps when not using them. But I recommend packing a charger or a portable one because the battery isn't that large for this powerhouse.Overall:I am very please with purchase! I bought a phone in Walmart for the same price, and this is WAYYYY better. I returned it after this came in the mail. If I would have know about this company, I wouldn't have bought my G2. This company makes excellent AFFORDABLE phones. Thanks BLU.",2015年3月1日 在美国审核
Awesome phone? yes.  Unadvertised USB OTG feature? YES! Couldn't be happier!,"We got this phone for my wife, and she loves it! I was also happy to find that for an off brand phone it has a lot accessories available.Great crisp screen with high dpi, clear hd calls,nice loud speakers, and a nearly vanilla bloatware free version of Kit Kat! I also really like the auto timer for powering on and off by day of week and time. The headphones were surprisingly nice and I found they play nice with my samsung phone.Not sure if it's been mentioned yet, but a great surprise for us was the USB OTG compatibility. Her Nexus 7 on KitKat required an import program, and my Samsung Galaxy light didn't have the feature at all. OTG wasn't mentioned many specs but I figured I'd test it anyway. I just slapped on an OTG cable with a 128 gigabyte flash drive and the phone recognized it immediately!USB OTG or ""on the go"" gives your phone the ability to host USB devices like a PC. The otg cables you need are Micro USB like your charger on one side and a female USB like on the front of your computer, also theyre very cheap and common. So far we've already tested with mice, keyboards, joysticks, camera imports, SD readers, and 3.5"" docked usb hard drives. This adds a lot more functionality to an already feature rich and incredibly priced phone!Hope this helps!",2015年1月16日 在美国审核

Comparison to Moto G below. Blu phone is a great value for the price and for heavy music/photo users since it has an SD slot.,"Our family has a Moto G (from Republic Wireless) for which this phone is a direct competitor.So I am going to compare them for you here.Weight (without case)Moto G weighs 5 oz (143g),Blu weighs 5.8 oz(166g), but it is largerSize of screen (diagonal)Moto G is 4.5 in,Blu is 5 inchesPixel DensityMoto G is 328 and Blu is 293.This is because they basically blew up the same number of pixels on the Moto G to a larger size for the Blu.This is somewhat noticeable, but not annoying.Battery:These are listed specs, I will talk about my actual use a little later.Moto G has 2070 Mah battery, and Blu has 2000 Mah,both are Li Ion (typical).Talk time is listed as 24 hours for Moto G and 22 hours for Blu.CPU speedMoto G is 1.2 GHz,Blu is 1.3 Ghz.Both are 4 core 1ith 1,024 Mb of Ram. I did not notice any difference in real use.ChipsetMoto G Qualcomm Snapdragon,BluMediaTek MT6582Rear cameraMoto G 5 megapixals,Blu 8 megapixel.Blu is better, but not hugely so.Front cameraMoto G 1.3 megapixel,Blu 2 Megapixel.Internal storageMoto G, 8 GBBlu 4 GB(you can get a 16GB Moto G too)SD cardMoto G, no slot.Blu up to 32Gb micro SD.(I have actually also seen that it can take up to 64GB, but the official spes seems to be 32GB).This is really a big plus, especially for people who use their phone as a media player, like a lot of apps, or take a lot of photos.You can have a LOT more music and photos on here than on the Moto G.A 32GB card does work fine.OtherBoth have micro USB charging.A nice touch on the Blu, the charging cord and cord for earbuds are flat, which means they tangle less.The adapter cord can also be removed from the plug, meaning you can use the wall charger for another device if needed (it is in two pieces, the charging cord and the plug for the wall).Blu has dual sims.I have not seen that much here in the States, but it can be really useful.You can switch back and forth between phone numbers (say work and personal, or data and phone). Right now I just have my pay as you go T mobile card in there, and the phone does complain it does not have the second sim.You need the STANDARD size sim card, not the micro that is pretty common.I was able to get an adapter for my T mobile micro for about seven bucks here on Amazon.That was easier than getting my phone number switched over, and I am able to move it back and forth between phones if I like.Battery life in real life is a little less than the Moto G.I tried to adjust the screen brightness to about the same (this affects the battery life a lot, and the maximum brightness can be very different for different devices).I would need a light meter to do a real test.Charged both to 100%.I then went about my day with both phones, attempting to use each about the same amount fairly heavily.At the end of the day, the Moto G had about 45% left and the Blu 35% left.This is in no way really scientific, although it makes some sense to me as the screen is larger on the Blu so it has to light up more area.The case you get with it will have to be the case you use, no super rugged cases available yet.Overall, this is a great unlocked phone for the price and I am happy to switch my old T mobile flip phone for this phone. I will be buying another one for my teen, this is a perfect replacement for her failing Ipod and will also allow her to use her pay as you go T mobile card.Because I can add a 32GB sim card, she can have all the music she wants on it for a hundred dollars less than a new 32Gb Ipod and also use it as a phone.Plus we can ditch Itunes, which is a big positive as far as I am concerned.To get a 16GB Moto G is 50 bucks morethan this phone and it would be half the memory.At this price point, this is a very well designed phone. The larger screen is also nice for watching media (which she does a lot)Keep in mind, this is a value phone, not a high end one.In the same way that I think it is unfair to expect a Honda to have the same features as a Lexus it is not reasonable to expect a 150 dollar phone to have the same specs as one that costs twice as much.",2014年8月20日 在美国审核
This phone has so many plus sides.,"Got a few things to say about this phone. One thing you have to watch out for is the battery life. The battery on this thing goes out in a flash. Although it is my current phone, so here's some of the perks I've noticed. Great widgets, my twitter widget is really cool in my opinion. Secondly, simplicity. I used my brothers phone for about 3 days waiting for this phone and when I was using it, It was pretty hard to find certain settings, widgets, etc. With this phone I found the WiFi, Security Setter, and Widgets easily. Lastly Durability, I must have dropped this thing thousands of times by accident and it still works amazingly. But if your planning on getting an iPhone or something later on I might not want to spoil yourself with phone-dropping -1 star because of battery though because that can count in a lot of ways, (For example: Road Trips) Side Note: The Case is really good. If your looking for a great, extremely cheap phone. BUY THIS PRODUCT. Blu is a great phone company and should keep up their good work.",2015年1月14日 在美国审核

Surprisingly good phone with very poor battery life,"I wanted a backup phone secondary and came across this one.It is 5 inch, unlocked with dual sim card slots, Android 4.4 (KitKat).Any decent unlocked phones with similar spec I seen are usually 400+ but this one is only 150?So what's the catch?Well, the CPU, Ram and screen resolution could be better but it is reasonable for the price.I honestly couldn't tell the difference in speed compare to phones that cost twice as much or more.I didn't test it with any games.The case feel all plastic but it does come with soft back cover.The major con I could think of is battery life is just very bad.I tried to use it as a media player when I went to the gym.The battery only lasted about 3.5 hrs from full charge to about 15% remaining.In the gym, I couldn't get WiFi and cell reception and I haven't install other apps beside the MX Player.Maybe I can get more mileage if I turned on Air Plane mode but still, I doubt it will last a full day if I used it as primary phone.Overall, I'm very impress with what it could do for the cost of 150, it is a great option if you don't mind the short battery life.",2014年8月19日 在美国审核
Great phone for the $,"Great phone for the $. Looked at other BLU PHONES found this was the optimum pick for me considering the features I wanted for the price I was willing to pay for them. Battery life was a con so I loaded ""Juice Defender Pro"" which I already had in my android library on another phone. It helped out considerably. I loaded up ""PIXELPHONE PRO"" to replace the default phone app. I have two T-Mobile Sim cards loaded on the phone with a Skype app. So far so good..",2015年1月16日 在美国审核
A Really Nice Phone,"This is my first BLU product and I'm impressed.Performance-wise, it's every bit as good as the much more expensive phone I was using before.

awesome in expensive phone,I love this phone.. Amazingly easy to use..awesome. Screen. Blu's tech support is great and is US based. Comparable to the interface of the Samsung galaxy's with outspending a huge amount of money on them. The only real complaint is for some reason I can't seem to video chat but whatever..

"A Solid, Budget Friendly Smartphone (Studio 5.0 HD) UPDATED","I've had a few cheap and junky cell phones in my day - the BLU Studio 5.0 HD is neither cheap nor junky!It comes in nice packaging, the cords (charging and earbuds) feel solid and so does the phone itself.After charging for a little while, I fired it up and it worked great even without the sim cards (I used the wi-fi easily and with no problems on my home network).Here are the pros and cons:PROS:1) The display is very responsive, quick, and vibrant - much better than my Nexus and my old Ipod touch.I like it's size - a big 5 inches!2) The speaker sounds good and is loud; it's on the rear of the phone, FYI.3) The GPS, radio, browser, and other apps work well, along with a Kindle app and Angry Birds app - they all looked and worked great!4) I watched live major league baseball on it (via wi-fi) and it was almost perfect!5) I love the rear camera - it shoots great pics and the camera app has some neat bells and whistles.6) I like the fact that you can program the phone to shut off and turn on at times you select.7) In the settings there are some cool (and geeky!) developer options that are fun to play with.CONS:1) So far the battery hasn't impressed me.It lasts about one day with average use.2) The power cord is on the top of the phone (minor complaint, yes, but it's a bit awkward).3) Another minor complaint I have is that the case included in the box is pretty minimal - I may need to get a better one.4) The instruction booklet only covers the basics, so if you're a first time Android or Kit Kat user, you may have to find more help online.5) UPDATE: As of August 2014, this phone does NOT work with Tracfone.Tracfone only takes CDMA transfer phones, but will not take this phone because it has a SIM card.In summary, after using this phone a bit, I'm very impressed.Without comparing the specs, this phone feels sort of like a small version of a new Nexus or something like that.If you're looking for a good, well designed smartphone but don't want to spend over two hundred dollars, I'd recommend this one!Feel free to ask questions....",2014年8月21日 在美国审核

"Despite the small battery and a few other quibbles, this is a ton of features for only 150 bucks","Although I am one of those odd folks who prefers using a computer for computer things and a phone for phone things, I know most people now want it all in one. Unless you're a constant all-day user, I would think this unlocked phone/camera/computer/toaster with dual sim and a very nice 8mp/1080p camera will do very nicely for 150 clams.First, the negatives. It's all plastic and a bit flimsy. But once again, this costs 150, and in two years you'll get twice this performance at half the price (and another 500 million phones will be rather needlessly thrown away, a very serious negative about new tech that no one seems to want to discuss, but some of us do notice and care; conserve when you can! Do you REALLY always need the newest phone?). The other main negative is the very short battery life, barely enough to get through the day if you use the computer aspects/games etc much. But it does come with a usb charger that goes straight into 120 AC, so that's a nice bonus that makes charging anywhere very easy. The last negative is the sound, pretty weak. But then again, there's not a whole lot of space for better speakers in a phone this thin. And I guess another negative is that this is pretty darn big for a phone; you'll need a purse for this, or a big cargo pocket. Phones were all about getting tinier and more portable for a long while, but that has clearly changed.The pluses are many, mainly that you get a ton of features with a crisp 5"" screen for 150. The price of this thing is surely the selling point, and with a camera this good and so many other user-friendly features for online use, that price seems quite amazing. As for screen protectors, the one they include is good, but call me crazy, because I most always just leave on the peel away plastic that comes on most small screens. I have with this phone so far, and it doesn't show fingerprints and the screen looks just fine to me through it.The processor works very quickly for my needs, with over 1gb RAM, and 4 gb internal space, plus room for 64gb via SD card. I can't see needing much more space than that. Heck, those stats were tough to get on a small laptop not too many years ago, so to have them on a phone still blows me away. But we're all getting spoiled for performance more every year, so people want the moon. I for one am still astonished by all this stuff for this little money.And the very best thing to me is being able to drop most any firm's sim card into it and whammo, suddenly everything is ready to go. That is the joy of unlocked phones, and it's hard to justify buying a 600 buck flagship phone and paying 500 bucks a year for it and then having it be a useless brick (leaking chemicals in the town dump) if you want another carrier when phones like this are out there for 1/4 the price, plus unlimited consumer choice.All in all, despite the negatives, for $150 this is just a ton of phone. And computer. And camera. And hi-def video camera. And you're not tied to any company with it. Pretty nifty.",2014年8月28日 在美国审核

At first I was skeptical because people who ordered from amazon were recieving the wrong color. Luckily, I received my pretty pink ☺Overall, this is a nice device. It runs KitKat out the box and is very responsive. I'm able to use google now. Lastly, with your own sd card you can expand the devices memory.The only con I can give is that the front facing camera isn't all the great.GREAT PHONE BLU!",2014年9月20日 在美国审核

It was also nice to get a free case but I wish I could find so more here on amazon. The battery life is great when the phone is idle but goes down pretty fast when you're using it. The only other problems I have with this phone are that I continuously have to turn my WiFi on and off at school and that when I send or receive pictures through text,the images are blurry but hopefully this can be fixed.

Good for those looking for the freeom of an unlocked phone and like the Android OS,"I'll fess up right now - I'm not a fan of Android phones.This is the second Android phone I've used (the other costing 2x to 3x more than the BLU) and both have exhibited some of the same faults.Namely, instability of the OS and the apps.For example, one of the times I attempted to turn on the BLU phone it went into what resembled a DOS mode.I had to restart the phone to get it to work.How or why this happened I have no idea.So before I get into the positives of the BLU, and there are several, my recommendation to anyone using an iPhone is that you'll be disappointed by the BLU.I don't say this as someone who thinks Apple is perfect.Far from it.They're control freaks who limit functionality to their users and punish those who step outside their walled in system.But that said, I've used several iPhones and I've never seen this level of instability.So why the four stars?Because I'm guessing that this instability is the par for Android.I'm basing this on two phones, of course, so maybe I'm wrong.And Android has its fans, in part because it's not a system that's hyper controlled by a single company like Apple.What you get is freedom with Android.So I'll respect that and rate the phone for what it is.So the positives:You get a 5 inch screen, an 8MP camera that also shoots HD video, expandable memory (you don't get that with an iPhone!), and an unlocked phone compatible with multiple networks.The included silicone case is totally inadequate.My recommendation is to get a more heavy duty case ASAP if you buy this phone.One drop onto a hard surface with the supplied case will likely ruin the phone.If you want the freedom of a smart phone without a contract AND you like the Android system and accept its flaws then the BLU could be an excellent choice.But again, don't expect the OS stability you experience with an iPhone.",2014年9月19日 在美国审核

I really like holding it without a case because the backplate is a little tacky which prevents you from dropping it but I use a case for protection.

"Solid, Budget, Unlocked Android Phone","PROS:After someone asked me to elaborate on my original review, I went looking for another unlocked Android phone at this price point.I couldn't find one.So, if price is an object, and you need a really inexpensive smartphone, here you go. Personally, I would spend a bit more and get a Galaxy S3 or Nexus 4.CONS:If you're coming from a relatively recent iPhone or Galaxy, swapping your mini or micro SIM into this phone is a serious hassle. Also, if you just want to use one SIM instead of two, the phone complains an awful lot. So, major minus marks for two, full-sized SIM slots. Of course, if you need that, they are quite easy to access.Then, there's the battery life. Unimpressive to say the least.

Great phone - 95% satisfied. (I wish it had external SD),"Unfortunately this review comes a little late in the game, and likely wouldn't have even happened had I not smashed my Galaxy S5.- Quick Background - I am in the tech industry by trade, and have been an android user since the Motorola Droid first arrived. My recording studio is exclusively Apple Products, though only out of necessity due to the software tools I create music with. (...and though I don't look down on the iPhone community, I personally would never choose to own one.) -I don't jump on the finance and upgrade bandwagon, so I haven't used the S6, S7, or S7 Note/PocketBomb. They are probably exceptional pieces of hardware, though the reason I clung so tightly to the S5 was sheer durability. It just worked for me, aside from being just a tiny bit small for my hands. If it hadn't met an untimely death leaping from my car, it would, no doubt, have required extensive counseling.Moving on-The Note 5 is a powerhouse compared to the Galaxy S5.The additional four (total eight) faster processor cores and additional ram (3Gb in all - S5 just 2) is more than a little noticeable. Multitasking is a snap for everything I do: Email/Text/Calls, Recording sound for later use, Maps, Ingress, Web Application like Soundcloud to manage the songs I post-...you get the idea. I'm not leeched to my phone constantly, but I am a heavy multitasker when I do. It also fits perfectly in my man-sized mitts.

Definitely worth the money.,"I have a Galaxy S8, but was looking for a work phone the works well, with decent specs, and a big screen.This was it, and it's a keeper.The phone obviously doesn't compare to the S8, but it holds it's own.I use for watching movies, playing music, taking pics, playing games.I play games that can be a bit taxing or that would cause lag on a mediocre phone.This phone doesn't lag, have pretty decent battery life, and records nice video.The only issue I have, is that sometimes the auto focus works to hard.It seems like it can't decide if it wants to focus what's closer in an image, or focus on what's in the background.When this happens, I move the phone back and forth a bit and it solved the issue.I also wish it had a micro sd card slot.FYIMy S8 has a 256gb card installed, and almost half full with games, movies and so on.I bought a second S8 thinking I might wear out the one I'm using, but it still sits new in box.I'm not an average user, so my phones go through a great deal.The Note 5 is holding up and continues to handle what I throw at it.Solid phone!",2018年4月20日 在美国审核

Sold with bad battery and now I'm stuck with it,"This is my 2nd order from this seller; no problems with the last. It got damaged, so I went back to them to purchase another. It seems they sold me a phone with an old battery. The cell phone I purchased never had the greatest charging ability, but it worked well enough until almost a month ago. I had a couple of tough moments with no charge working, then this last week, it barely charges at all (max 35%). I've tried several chargers and several outlets. You can see that it is connected, but it will not take a full charge. I'm a Realtor and cannot go a single day without my cell phone for communication, as well as work apps for opening doors. I contacted them about this issue on Thursday, but was told that they only offer a 30 day warranty. My best guess is that they used an old or faulty battery on this phone that is now at the end of its life. I trusted this company b/c of my previous purchase, but now they've sold me a phone with a wasted battery and I've thrown money away on an outdated phone for a little over 4 months of use. I could have purchased a brand new phone for less if you count month-for-month cost. Clearly, I now have to lease/purchase a new Note 10 through my cell provider. PS -- It will cost me $31/month for 12 months. The refurbished Note 5 I purchase from TheGizmoTrader cost me $55/month for 4 months of service (I purchased it for $220). Shame on me for trusting this company. That is a ripoff to a customer who'd happily have purchased another phone from them every two years. THIRTY DAYS is not an adequate warranty of product, especially if they're using old batteries.",2019年3月16日 在美国审核

"Unfortunately, the antennae was defective and it would not maintain a network signal.","This phone appeared to arrive NEW, factory shrink-wrapped in its original packaging as advertised. This was a relief as many reviews from other sellers stated that their phone arrived refurbished although advertised as new. Side note: make sure you go to an actual Verizon store and not just a Verizon 'authorized retailer' to get a SIM card to activate the phone. The 'authorized retailers' will charge you for a SIM card, while they are free from Verizon stores.Update: This phone worked great at home near a cell tower, but had no network signal and dropped calls where my other Verizon phone had a full network signal. When driving down the highway, the phone's network constantly switched from 4g to 3g to 1x networks, dropping calls in between. After troubleshooting with Verizon's tech support, they believe the phone has a defective antenna. Returning phone to seller.",2018年5月24日 在美国审核
What More Do We Really Need?,"Obviously this is not the latest/greatest phone but it probably is plenty of phone and camera for most of us for a lot less money than later generations.As advertised, this is a 'brand new' phone.If you order this phone you can expect:1. The battery will be completely flat on arrival so it'll be on the (included) charger for about an hour before you can start playing with it.2. If this is replacing an older phone you might have to visit a phone store (Verizon in my case) to get a new sim chip.The sim from my dead Note 4 was too large but it only took a few minutes for the store to program a new one (free) and test it.3. Order a case, any case when you order this phone.This puppy is slippery!4. The Samsung file transfer utility works ok to send your apps from an older phone to this one but it won't transfer the data.If you've told Google to save your data during regular backups you 'might' be able to download each app again from the Play Store and have them installed and set up just the way they were on the old phone.This worked with some of my apps, not so well with others.5. The listing says the phone comes with Android 4.1 installed.I can't attest to that because as soon as I started it, an update to Android 7.0 was downloaded and (with my permission) installed.Several security updates were installed after that.6. This phone does not have a memory expansion slot for a micro sd card so get the 64gb model.If you have music and other data on a chip from another phone you'll have to copy it all to the internal memory.I found the easiest/fastest way to do this was plug the new phone into a pc and plug your sd card into that same pc then simply copy/paste files into folders that are already shown in the phone for music, data, downloads etc.That's about it.As mentioned up top, this may not be the fastest phone available but it's probably all most of us need and it's pretty hard to beat the price without trusting a reconditioned unit.Cheers!",2019年1月9日 在美国审核

Different product than what was advertised,"I don't like to give bad reviews, so I'll just explain why I gave a one star. First, the ad said it was a black phone when it was actually a gold phone. I did get an email explaining that, but it had already shipped. Second, the ad said it was a Verizon ready phone -- NOT! After I got the Sim card and tried to activate it myself, it didn't work - I took it to Verizon the next day and they said it is an AT&amp;T phone. I also noticed that it had a lot of apps that didn't look factory downloaded. The guy at Verizon said that the camera was cracked--I'm thinking this phone was used. So, with all of this said, I couldn't bring myself to give this review more than one star - why did I give it even a star? The people at Reliant did contact me personally by phone and offered to send me a new phone.I did not take them up on their offer since I needed a phone right away. I ended up buying a brand new Verizon Galaxy J7v. When it was all said and done I spent less. So, just go to your local Verizon dealer. Sometimes better to be safe than sorry.",2019年1月31日 在美国审核

I opened the package to see a huge chip in the back of the phone like someone had taken a heavy object to it. not only that but I'm an artist and I like having a phone that I can doddle on, so I was excited to get a phone with a stylus so I can sketch and such. but that hope quickly faded when I tried to take the stylus out and the back of it popped off of the stylus and the pin was trapped in there and I couldn't get it out... and you can barelyget 2 hours of idle time (what ever its called when the phone is in sleep or not in use but still on) before the phone dies, and barely 30 minutes before it dies when active. all together im regretting not spending a bit more money to get a new one.",2020年8月6日 在美国审核
3/5 stars for unoriginal charger and no screen protector or phone cases like description says,"After reading a few reviews I hope my experience is not the same... so far seems good, main reason why I purchased another (this note 5), being my 2nd one after losing my first. I'll give it a few months and update my experience. A little disappointed there's actually two separate descriptions, as one claims an original charger(not actually the case), it would've been the fast charger Samsung style one that came with my first one. And another part of the the description says two wallet cases, and a screen protector come with it(neither of those were received at all).

Happy With Refurnished Samsung Galaxy Note 5,"Purchased and received a refurbished 64Gb galaxy note 5.I was concerned about any defects in the glass or case,but both looked pristine on arrival. Did not receive a SIM tray removal tool which caused me some grief, but holding a sewing needle with a pair of pliers worked fine to pop the tray out. My Note 4 sim card would not fit in the note 5 which really annoyed me. I had to request a new sim from Sprint.Pros:1) Beautiful screen, seems sharper than the Note 4 in my opinion, even though the specs are the same. 2) 2x2 ac wireless which is working really well with my Asus RT-AC68U.3) S-Pen and free writing. I like it and use it all the time. 4) Feels very quick and responsive. 5) Built-in wireless charging.Cons: 1) No removable battery. Amost a deal breaker for me, but I decided to buy any way.2) That pop-out sim tray sucks.

Which it has broken the arm in the module for the pen to sense the pen is connected. Just so the person now's and is selling these devices you can fix these with little as 10 to 15bucks and it's not hard fix. But overall I think I know the reason why it's set at that price because he knew if he fixed them the price would 10 bucks less to original because he had open them fix 'em. So to seller thank you for the device. It's good quality of a device from Samsung.,2017年8月30日 在美国审核
Not truly refurbished,Update! June 2018 phone just went to black and never came on again. Attempted soft and hard reset by technician and nothing. Phone lasted 14 months of lite use and was never dropped or damaged physically.Cosmetically clean. However doubtful that it was refurbished at all. Original battery must still be in it because a full charge lasts a couple hours even when not in use. Makes it a corded phone.,2017年6月19日 在美国审核

Happy customer,This would be a first smartphone with a stylus for my mom. She likes my Note 4 and all that I do with it.

No marks on the screen, just a couple Tiny scuffs on the physical Homes button. Phone is great aside from that. No software or hardware issues so far, a couple weeks in from purchase now.

GLASS BROKEN FROM THE INSIDE!?,"GET A WARRANTY IF POSSIBLE.BUYER BEWARE. Phone came with some damage to outer [metal] rim. However that is not the reason for the low review. Before I had gotten a case for it the phone slid off of my night stand and fell2ft onto a rug, and the back glass panel shattered! 2 ft, rug, and it shattered.I later inspected it in preparation for temporary repairs and it appears that something INSIDE the phone was (and still is) putting focused stress on the back.As if something like a small rock or nail is puncturing the back of the phone.Again, from what I can see (with out actually removing the back panel) this isn't something that was lodged in the glass from outside but is pushing through from the inside.However even after this the phone has functioned well and I really enjoy the Samsung Note 5 in general, therefore two stars instead of one.BOUGHT FROM EDGE CELLULAR",2017年7月30日 在美国审核

Great phone for those who are not on a Verizon contract and don't want to be. Save money!,"Purchased this phone from LTE Warehouse as an Amazon Prime item.Item purchased: Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Black64GB (Verizon Wireless) for $539.00 on Aug 30, 2016.Item was described as new, and appeared to be new when I unboxed it.Comments: Never, ever buy a phone from any of the major stores even if they are giving away the phone for ""free"". Free cell phones are for people who are bad with math. I am a current Verizon customer, but am no longer on a contract (am on month-to-month). I am also on a shared device plan. Verizon wants about $800 for this phone unless you sign up for a plan where they will give you the phone for free or $100 or so, along with adding $20 per month to your plan (at the time I checked, and for a 3 year contract (if carried to term that's $1,440 for the ""free"" phone). I paid $539 for this phone while keeping my current plan at no additional costs or connection fees. I switched from a Samsung S4 to this Note 5. Since the SIM card in the Note 5 (Nano SIM) is not the same size as the one with the S4 (Micro SIM), I could not just switch SIM cards. What you can do is go to your local *corporate* Verizon store and they will give you a SIM card FOR FREE and activate your new phone on the spot. If the clueless rep at the Verizon store tries to charge you, tell them Verizon tech support said the SIM card would be free at a corporate Verizon. Ask in advance.IMPORTANT NOTE: I bought this phone and it was defective. The back button worked for a few hours, started to flake out, then the back button no longer worked at all. The back button would only work with the stylus pen. After googling it, there was a batch of the Note 5's that had this issue. I contacted LTE Warehouse and they *promptly* returned my money along with giving me a free postage sticker to mail phone back to them. I then received the replacement phone. BUT IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU, here's the procedure you need to follow BEFORE you return a Note 5 phone to any supplier. If you do not follow this procedure, the supplier will charge you about $50 to bypass the google security lock feature on the phone.Device protection in Android Lollipop 5.1 is enabled automatically when the following two criteria are met:there is at least one Google account on the device.the lock screen security must NOT be none or swipe.There is no option to disable device protection on the phone.But if any one(or both) of the two conditions is not met, device protection in Android Lollipop 5.1 will be automatically disabled.In other words, you can try any of the following tricks so that you can bypass device protection on Android Lollipop 5.1 BEFORE you do a factory data reset:remove all Google accounts on the phone before factory data reset.set lock screen security to none.set lock screen security to swipe.**** if you don't do the above before you do the factory reset and ship the phone back, you will have to pay $50 for someone to do this ***************visit youtube dot com slash watch?v=DJ8_qbj1DPQfor more information on this security feature.",2016年9月19日 在美国审核

"Until the New Note 8 comes out next year this Note 5 will do just ""Perfect!""","Samsung Note 5 is as good as Note 7 without Iris scan and the edge apps but just about everything is as near perfect as the Note 7 without having to worrying about the batter issue.I had the extra Note 7 S-Pan and I changed the tip and it feels better then the original tip from Note 5.Note 7 S-Pen doesn't fit in the Note 5 because it's little shorter and the dimple at the front side is on further back.As long as the original S-Pen is not in the Phone, I could use the Note 7 S-Pen and Note 5 S-Pen back and forth.AT&amp;T had multiple updates and that took about an hour to get all the update to be installed (I was installing other apps at the same time).I tried the AT&amp;T Setup and Transfer but didn't work so I used the Smart Switch to restore all my settings and some files from Note 7 and S7 edge. Samsung Pay, Knox, Samsung+, Samsung Focus, S Translator and Good Lock apps works as good as from S7 edge and the Note 7,The Note Series are little slower than the other Samsung Galaxy Series but it's better than the Note 1, 3 and the Note 4, I had used previously.Little bigger than the S7 edge and the Note 7 and the other thing I like about the Note 5 is it's flat screen (almost) instead of curved edge like Note 7, I couldn't use my S-Pen as easy as the flat screen on Note 5.2 of S-Pen options like Magnify and the GIF creator is not available directly from the Air Command but there is an app you can use to create GIF.I like the round edge on the back side but it's finger print magnet and smudges on every touch (like Note 7 and Galaxy S7 and edge). In few days I will receive the S-View Folio and I will use the Samsung 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive Duo as a external drive, [USB &amp; Micro USB 2 in 1] Rocketek Mini Micro SD Card Reader, and Tempered-Glass Screen Protector 2.5D Round Edge.Until the New Note 8 comes out next year this Note 5 will do just ""Perfect!"".",2016年10月28日 在美国审核

"Excellently refurbished like brand new, Outstanding delivery time and amazing Price from Edge Cellular","📱👀😲👍🙄👌😀Edge Cellular did an amazing job with this Note5.The phone is excellent. I just came from a Note4 still have it, but couldn't be happier with this Note5 since I couldn't keep the Note7. It's in way better condition than they described and I was expecting, especially since the price was so low.And even better, I clicked on 1 day delivery at 3:00am and got it in my hands at 12:00 noon. I think it was a couple of states away but they used special couriers and delivery services to make sure it got to me in just several hours from buying, and they didn't even charge an arm and a leg. I couldn't be happier. I'm writing this review on the Note5 right now. So I just want to take this opportunity and say Thanks to Edge Cellular. Outstanding delivery time and perfectly refurbished phone as if brand new operating system on AT&amp;T. Went through the full set up service just like with every brand new just bought phone. It was like the phone had never been turned on or set up before and just came from AT&amp;T. The people at Edge Cellular are apparently expert technicians and real phone people who are just as needy about phones as I am and then had it inspected 3 times.

Poor quality.,"I'll blame the low quality because of Samsung but unfortunately you're an authorized dealer for them. I had a glass screen protector, a phone case I dropped that phone the second day of purchasefrom 1ftoff the ground. It landed completely flat wothout bouncing.The screen went totally black and that phone is been sitting in my drawer ever since without a single scratch on it. That is also the last time I've ever bought a new cell phone I spent $1,200 and cell phones in a month-and-a-half around that time paying 450-600$ per phone.HIGHER PRICES LOWER QUALITY!! I HAVE never had a problem with Samsung phones previous to that And I've only bought Samsung phones since 2006. I had a note 5 as well before this purchase I took that note 5snowboarding and made calls at 12,000 ft and -10 degree weather. But yet this phone that I bought from this dealer through Amazon I dropped once in the freaking thing was done no scratches no cracks nothing. I believe right now refurbished cell phones are the most popular in the US due to lack of quality of the $600 phones that are pieces of s*** to be very blunt.You'll never ever catch me buying a new cell phone again the phone I have now was used at a pawn shop and it's been working since the Note 5 broke and I've had zero problems with it.",2017年7月9日 在美国审核

I believe then sold me a refurbished phone.,"I wanted to wait roughly 3 weeks to provide an accurate review of this cell phone. First, I love the Note 5 and have always been a fan of the Note series. However, I am not sure if this phone was a manufacture or seller refurbished phone giving that I did not want a refurbished phone. My proclamation of the phone possibly being refurbished is due to the fact that oftentimes the window usually the text message window would somewhat refresh itself (Hard to describe, but the best way would be to imagine if you click the refresh button on a website on your computer and the screen will go transiently go blank then pop back up. That is what happens with the text messaging sometimes). Also, the actually text keyboard randomly closes sometimes. Not sure if it is a touch screen problem or digitizer problem, but it is sometimes annoying. The headphones that were sent with the phone were damaged and didn't work properly.Update: buying the phone in October and it is now Jan. I must say that I truly believe I was led to believe this phone was practically near perfect. After using the phone for a few months, I have concluded that the phone was refurbished with displaying potentially previous defects. It is truly annoying at times.",2016年11月11日 在美国审核

We did end up having to buy a new charger ($40) because the one that came with it; was seriously frayed; not sure how nobody realized that. I know I am complaining asof right now but the phone works great! Also, if we knew it was used we would of been more aware, and be perfectly okay with some minor issues.

My Favorite Note So Far!!!,"Let me get this out of the way first.I know there is a ton of people of who care about the removable battery or SD card slot, fortunately I am not one of them. Second I purchased this phone from BestBuy and not through Amazon so I can’t speak too much about their service.I bought the Note 5 to replace my aging Note 4.I was bouncing back and forth between my Note 4 and IPhone 6 Plus. The Note 4 was my main daily phone (my work horse) and the IPhone was my battery champion when I knew I was going to a conference or somewhere that I wouldn’t readily have access to a charging source.I was honestly surprised on the evening when this phone was released that it was sold out pretty much across the city of Boston since so many people online were making such a big stink about the lack of removable battery and SD card slot, I figured be able to walk in and pick one up no problem.When I finally was able to get my hands on the Note 5, I have to say I loved the look and feel of the Note 4 but there is no competition here.I was blown away by how premium the Note 5 feels and in my opinion is on par with IPhone 6 Plus and possibly even out does it in that department.Here are a few of the reasons why I love this beast of a phone.Camera:The Note 5 has a 16 megapixel camera that features OIS and 4K video recording.The day I got this phone I was on my way to Arlington, VA for a conference but due to some last minute changes the conferences was basically cancelled and since I was already there figured I would do some sightseeing and take some pictures with my shiny new phone.The daylight shots were stunning, I thought the hype over of the Galaxy S6 camera was maybe overblown but once I used the Note 5’s camera I got to see what all the fuss was about and I have to say Samsung has done a fantastic job simplifying the camera UI and making it almost IPhone simply to use.The double click of the home button works amazing fast.I am not a professional photographer but it’s nice to play with Pro Mode even though I have no clue what I am doing.4K videos look amazing, just be aware that it will eat up the storage on your phone fairly quickly.There is no competition between this camera and my IPhone so no need to compare them.Design:The Note 5 has a glass front and back with aluminum sides, this is really nothing new since the IPhone 4 &amp; 4s, the Sony Xperia phones and even to certain extent the Nexus 4 all had these same designs but I don’t care this is best feeling phone I have ever held and this definitely one of the best looking phones that Samsung ever made possibly just behind the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.My only complaints with the design are that its slippery, I picked up the phone but didn’t really take it out of the box until I got to the Airport since I was running late and had no time to goof off but as soon as I took it out of the box it immediately slipped out my hand, my heart stopped for second but luckily it landed on my travel bag.As soon as I landed in DC I bought a case for it which it’s unfortunate to have to cover up such a gorgeous piece of tech, it’s the equivalent of having a super-hot girlfriend who always wears cloths that ten times too big for her.The other complaint that was also solved by the case is the finger prints.I bought the white version so it’s not too big of issue on mines but if you prefer the black version be prepared to carry a cloth around with you at all times to wipe it down.One other small complaint that I have is way is it that American carries only offer black and white as the color options but there is a space grey and silver option as well?S-Pen:If you’re a avid Note user like myself then you probably know all the amazing things that the S-pen can do at this point and there is little need for me to recap but there are a few new tricks that I love, when the screen is off if you pull out the pen its activates the screen in this really cool black and white mode, that allows you to take a really quick note without turning on the screen.This feature is way more useful than you might imagine.My favorite is screen capture for longer pagers, copy and sign long PDF’s directly on my phone.In my opinion this is the best productivity phone that you can buy.Screen:The 2K screen on the Note 5 seems similar to the Note 4 which is a good thing.They are bought bright and vibrant.They both have a ultra-bright mode for direct sunlight but this mode is only accessible screen brightness is set to auto.Watching HD videos on this phone are amazing, I purchased a movie to watch on my flight back to Boston the person next to me commented to me how awesome the screen looked and couldn’t believe how fair phones have come over the last few years and even took the time point out the screen to his wife.The screen has four modes that you can choose from and they all range from very vibrant to tone down colors.Everything Else:In past Samsung phones Touchwiz made a mess of things but this time around Samsung did a great job of toning things down and optimizing the phone for processor.This has resulted in not only the fastest Samsung phone I’ve ever used but a phone that is closely comparable to the experience that you get on an IPhone.They did remove the IR blaster which I was bummed about but I got over it fairly quickly.I love the new themes that you can put on your phone that change the entire look and feel of the phone.There are hundreds of downloadable themes and it only takes a few seconds to apply them to the phone.Lastly the Note 5’s battery has smaller capacity than the Note 4’s but from what I have seen so far, its last easily a full day, you won’t get two days but honestly in this day and age I can’t think of a single reason or what I’d be doing that I need a battery to last two full days, I have portable battery packs, wireless chargers, fast chargers and car chargers.I just need it last my full work day which it easily does.Conclusion:I know there is a ton of people out there who are upset about the exclusion of the removable battery and SD card slot but in my opinion this is easily the best work that Samsung has ever done with their phones.In my opinion this is best phone that Samsung has ever released.If you like premium phones, that do a little more than just be big phones like the Nexus 6 or the IPhone 6 Plus, give this phone a look, it’s definitely worth a look.",2015年9月10日 在美国审核

"Excellent phone, the best Android on the market","Let me preface this review by saying I am a device and tech hound. I am coming from a perfectly good Galaxy S5 and choose to pay full price for an upgrade. It was worth every penny and don't regret the decision one bit.The first thing that grabs you about this phone is the awesome build quality of the phone. This is a first rate device no question. As good as anything the boys from Cupertino can put out. The phone is sleek and has a super high quality feeling in your hand. Not that the S5 was bad but this is like comparing a Toyota to Lexus in terms of materials and fit/finish. As an iPad Air 2 owner I can say this device has a feel just as premium if not more so. The stylus clicks into place with a satisfying sound as well and functions well even though I use an Otterbox. The wireless charging feature also works fine through the Otterbox.Performance, this thing is a beast. Eight cores, 4 GB of ram as much as my 3 year old HP Elitebook might I add. A screen resolution so crisp and clear the colors literally jump out at you. The ability to multi task and run several apps at once is incredible. It blows the doors off the S5 in every performance measure and packs a nice large screen in a relatively small package. I love the 5.7 inch screen size and is notably bigger than the 5.1 on my S5. I considered other 5.5 plus inch phones but kept coming back to the balance of performance and size of the Note 5. If you are on the fence between a small tablet or a large phone this phone is a good compromise. Camera performance is remarkable and the image stabilization is noticeable. Haven't gotten a chance to use the raw mode yet but this is another great feature putting it light years ahead of the competition. The best camera is the one you have on you. This might just be the best one period certainly as good as standard compact digital cameras under 200 dollars. Not as good as a larger sensor enthusiast grade compact or DSLR but impressive in its own right and better than many of the affordable entry level digital cameras today.Performance as phone is excellent too, who would have thought that is what a smart phone is first and foremost a phone. Texting is also a breeze with the built in Samsung messaging app. Speaker phone is appropriately loud as well.Lastly to address the 500 lb elephant in the room is the lack of an SD card and removable battery, I was one of the people morning the loss but thanks to excellent battery performance and the awesome build quality it can be overlooked. Plus with the new USB OTG flash drives you can easily save and back up/transfer information. Thus I was able to go with a pearl white 32 GB model which will be more than enough for me.I considered a wide variety of Android and even the iPhone 6 Plus but nothing came close to the balance of performance and value to what the new Note 5 offers. As of fall 2015 this is the phone that sets the standard and an awesome stylus to jot notes down is a bonus.",2015年9月5日 在美国审核
Best phone i've ever had,"If you're worried about battery life...don't. First of all, the more powerful smart phones get, the more complaints you'll have about battery life. Plus, depending on your phone settings, screen brightness, and usage battery life can vary. While i was disappointed that there was no exchangeable battery as on older samsung models, I got over that real quick. Plus, I know keep a 20800mah external charger with me so I don't really worry about my device dying.It's a great phone. This is hands down the best phone i've every purchased.",2016年3月10日 在美国审核
Great phone though battery life is poor compared to previous model,Pro'sThe display is really nice and is really clear.The charger for this device charges extremely fast. Took me a little over an hour to get a full charge from 14%.S-Pen is just as good if not better from previous versions.Comfortable to hold though with the glass back it makes me nervous to set on counters.Finger Print works well and you can have up to 5 different finger set.If you're in an application and get a message you don't have to leave the app to respond. It overlays the current app and lets you reply.Kids Mode - Like other Samsung Phones it offers a locked down version for kids with apps just for kids (my daughter loves it)Wireless charging compatibleCon'sThe biggest set back for me is the battery life really took a hit with this model. I had the note 3 previously and I can listen to audio books all day and get home at the end of the day and still have 60% battery on a 2 year old phone. This phone I could be at 30%. There are days where I hardly use it and at the end of the day my battery is nearly dead. Granted the charger can boost it by about 30% in about 15 minutes.Doesn't seem to like multi-finger input.The edge of the display is so close to the edge and sensitive that if your touching the screen it renders the rest of the display unresponsive.This isn't huge for me but it does happen from time to time. When my 2 yr old uses it she encounters this problem frequently.OverallI really like the phone its quick/snappy and has features that make multitasking easy. Along with some nice new features with the S Pen. Battery life is ok since it charges so quickly. That is really my only main issue with this phone. Just to shave off a few mm on the size of the phone they put a smaller battery in it. So if you are a heavy phone user you may want to keep your charger around to give it a quick boost. I would recommend getting a wireless charger for your desk or for where you spend the most of your day so you wont have any battery life issues.,2015年10月8日 在美国审核
"Note 5, convinced me I don't need removable back and expandable memory &amp; impresses me with the battery life and use experience.","Bar-none, the best phablet to date.I owned the Note 3 and 4.While I was initially upset over the move to unibody, I now find myself sold and convinced I don't need either.If you need a workhorse phablet, there is no other choice.Not the iphone plus, this is the leader and only choice in my opinion.The stylus has been improved and runs faster and smoother.The fingerprint security scanner is much better than the Note 4.The phone itself sports an amazing bezel to body ratio with an amazing AMOLED screen.As I do pay attention to specs, I pay more attention to experience.Each year, phones release no doubt with the latest and updated specs but that's just hardware.What is the overall software experience?Make no mistake, this phone has hardware muscle.This phone did not disappoint me one bit.I use this phone for listening through Bluetooth connected to the LG Ultra headsets, shopping on eBay/Amazon/Craigslist, mobile banking, check work and personal email, streaming and casting YouTube, and generally google searching information.I may use apps like Fandango, Yelp, SpotHero or other information search for restaurants, movie or parking reservations, etc.This is a great phone.I have no complaints no regrets no dispointments.At first, I contemplated whether to upgrade from the Note 4, but haven't looked back.It's more compact, it's more streamlined, it's faster and snappier, more powerful, has better APT-X music sound, better higher screen quality, and the battery efficiency is completely lasting me all day easily (I don't even think battery life while using it all day).It's a great phone if you want and need the phablet.The Note 5 didn't kill the iPhone, it just created its own market and its own following by recognizing what people wanted.There's no other choice but the original phablet.I'm excited to see what the Note 6 will do considering the S7 refinements.",2016年3月5日 在美国审核
... phones since the 2nd generation and this is the best one yet,"I've had every Note in the Note series of phones since the 2nd generation and this is the best one yet.DesignI've found this to be one of the best designed phones I've used and I've had most of the flagship phones over the years. It feels incredibly solid and balanced in the hand. The curved glass on the back of the phone makes it feel natural and easy to grip. I've seen people complain that the glass design makes it very slippery but I've found it more grippy than many popular aluminum designed phones. The side of the device features a solid aluminum bezel with an anodized finish. It doesn't have the same shiny, sharp, scratch prone edges that the previous generation had which makes it feel great in hand and more durable long term. Between the beautiful design and great in hand feel I'm hesitant to even put a case on it. The bezels are very narrow especially along the sides of the display which combined with the curved glass on the back makes it smaller than other devices in the same category(even those with smaller displays). I've used both the white version and own the 64 GB Black Sapphire version. The white version has a very subtle shimmer when in direct light. Kind of like a white pearl. The Black Sapphire version looks black in some conditions but when the light hits it it is a deep shimmering blue.SoftwareOn my Verizon version there was a lot of carrier apps and a few games that I didn't want. These can be disabled. Beyond that the general UI and software seems much scaled back and toned down from previous versions. The UI is much cleaner and lighter. I like the stock look but you also have a theme store so you can change the look entirely. I like to use a theme called Material Dark which is a dark take on the stock UI of Googles Nexus phones. These themes carry across the general UI, icons, and into things like the stock Samsung Messages &amp; email apps and even the stock Keyboard. It's a great improvement in general. You can open multiple windows for multitasking. I personally love having the YouTube app playing a video on top while using Chrome to browse.DisplayI've found the display to be a great improvement over the previous gen. While it's the same as far as size and resolution I feel like the Note 5's is not only more accurate but the display on my unit is more even. My older model's display was more yellow on the bottom and blue on the top of the display while this Note 5 display is consistent and even. This is one of the coolest(as in white/bluish)AMOLED displays I've seen. I've even had people comment on how blue it looks. I personally prefer cooler looking displays vs yellow displays so I really like it. It has great brightness and if you leave it on auto brightness it gets quite bright and contrasty when you are outside.Battery LifeI've been getting very good battery life. With mixed usage I've been getting around 6.5 hours of screen on time and sometimes as much as 1 day and 18 hours of standby time. Please note that I read Kindle books a lot with the brightness turned very low so this could skew my screen on time a bit higher than average. I still haven't had a moment where I've run out of battery in a days usage. In my opinion one of the most notable features on the Note5 is the rapid charging. It fully charges in around 1 hour and 15 mintues. You will get several hours of charge just by putting it on the rapid charger for 15 minutes. Samsung also has a Rapid Wireless Charger coming soon that I'm very excited about. It fully charges the phone in around two hours. If you are looking for something more portable they also have a Rapid external battery charger accessory available. I have acquired a generic QI wireless charger and my phone fully charges in around 3-4 hours. Overall, between the good battery life and the rapid charging I don't see as much of an issue with not having a removable battery.Fingerprint ScannerThis is a real improvement. You no longer have to swipe your finger across it. It's easy to setup and I've actually been impressed with how accurate and quick it is. If on the rare chance that it doesn't properly register your fingerprint the phone vibrates to inform you it didn't. I've found on the occasions that it didn't work it was really my fault for pulling my finger away too quickly.PerformanceIt is an incredibly snappy device. It's by far the best phone in terms of performance(and otherwise) that I've ever used. I have found absolutely no lag. The new scaled back Touchwiz helps a lot with this. Pages load instantly while browsing the internet. The phone unlocks instantly and without any lag even when using the fingerprint scanner.CameraThe camera is probably one of my favorite features. It features 16 megapixels with optical image stabilization, f/1.9 lens, and 4k Video recording. It is extremely quick to load and snaps pics instantly. If you need to take a quick photo literally all you have to do to start it is raise your phone and double click the home button even with the display off and it's ready to go. The low light performance even without a flash has been just great. I took a photo of an item I was selling online in a nearly dark room and it came out clear and bright and with little noise even without having using the flash. The camera interface is great. You have the option to switch to a PRO mode which gives full manual controls. There is also an option to take pictures in RAW mode which adds another layer of quality. It focuses very quickly and pictures snap instantly. I've found that even with full auto mode the pictures turn out quite well. Overall, it's by far the best smartphone camera I've used.StylusI've never been a huge user of the stylus on any of my Note phones. One of the things I do like using it for is things like jotting notes on screen shots or pictures when texting or emailing them. The other is using it for contextual menus in full desktop websites which literally no other phone can do. There is one thing about this model that is making me find it much more useful. You can now remove the stylus while the display is off. It will activate the screen with a solid black background and you can take notes on the fly. It's literally like having a digital notepad that you can instantly and conveniently whip outs and jot a note on without hassling with unlocking the phone. I find this hugely convenient and I'm guessing if most people try it the stylus will get used a lot more. I have mixed feelings in regards to the new click out stylus. You press it in like a button and it pops out enough to pull it out. I like that it is embedded and out of the way since I don't use it often but I'm very skeptical about the long term durability of the clicking mechanism. Also, you have to always be careful not to put in in the wrong way as it can get stuck and permanently damage your phone. I doubt it will happen but I would really like a revised version in the future.StorageI've used both the 32 GB White version and own the 64 GB Black Sapphire. The 32 GB has about 20 GB of storage free out of box and the 64 GB around 50 GB.DislikesThere isn't a lot that I don't like. One thing is there used to be an option to turn the lights off on the capacitive buttons. I like to turn them off when I'm reading so they don't glare in my eyes. This option to disable the lights is missing from the Verizon and maybe other carriers versions. Luckily I found a free app on the Play store that allows them to be disabled.ConclusionWith most Android phones I've always felt like there was at least one thing missing that made me not completely like it. I haven't felt that so far with the device. I've found the updated and scaled back Touchwiz a huge improvement, the physical design of the phone to be top notch and not only look incredible but feel durable, it has the best smartphone camera I've used out of literally any device on any smartphone platform, and the performance is best in class. I know older Note users don't like that the removable battery is gone but I really feel like that is completely mitigated by the rapid charging. I do recommend you get the 64 GB version since there is no removable storage. Overall, I feel like it's literally the best device currently available.",2016年6月16日 在美国审核
Best phone Samsung or Apple that I have ever ownewd,"First, let me say that I have owned every single Samsung Note since the first one all the way to the Note 5 now and after 7 months of daily use on may Note 5 it is by far and above my favorite cell phone I have ever owned!Here are some of the things I like and don't like about it:Pros:1. The phone has held up incredibly well after 7 months despite being dropped a bunch of times by myself and my 3 year old toddler. There are no cosmetic damages to the phone or screen defects and I have even dropped it in the sink with the water running once and it was fine.2. Battery life versus other note phones is great although I would say the Note 4 had the best battery life of the whole series, but it had a bigger battery so that makes a lot of sense.3. The screen resolution is great. I toggle between this phone and a Iphone 6 plus and this is by far my choice. Screen is just brighter for reading the web and doing gaming.4. I got a GEAR VR in december and fell in love with it. Since it only works with this phone I figured why not. I was concerned it would mess up the battery or overheat the device and I have experienced no problems with daily use for 4 months.5. It's well made and doesn't feel cheap. It has the same premium feel as the Iphone 6 plus only it is not slippery on the back in the way that the iphone is.6. It charges super fast. I use the included HI-SPEED charger that comes with it and I can get a 50% charge in like 30 minutes! It also works really well with various hi speed car charges that run on 2.0-2.4 amps which the phone can handle for hi-speed charging.7. Hardly any lag ever despite how many windows I have open. The extra RAM really makes a difference while viewing videos or toggling through a webpage really fast.8. The glass is realllllly hard to scratch. I had a Zagg tempered glass screen protector on it for 5 months until I bought the GEAR-VR and decided it would be a good idea to take it off to use it (not knowing that the Oculus app ran internally so it did not matter if the glass was covered with a good screen protector.) Needless to say, it has been 3 months and I have yet to scratch the screen with the protector taken off. After using the delicate Iphone I was almost conditioned to purchase the tempered glass on every new phone and paying $40+ at best buy plus their geek squad $7 fee was getting old. I don't think enough people realize how hard this Note 5 screen is to scratch. I have it in my pocket all the time with various cases on it and its flawless. It's probably rubbed against coins, my keys and other junk. I even dropped it this morning at the gym on the treadmill and it was unscathed.9. The S-PEN is awesome! I never really used it before this phone and I have since taken to it. It's really nice to be able to sign a document for business without printing it out, wasting paper, scanning it, saving it and reattaching it. I also write stuff on my own photos to remember where I was sometimes or what I was doing that day so I don't have to take the time to go into the details information section on the photos.10. The camera! It's 16 megapixel and it really is better than the Iphones and even most click and shoot cameras on the market today. Obviously you're not going to get DSLR quality without a DSLR lens. That being said, I have taken incredible low light and nighttime photos. The Autofocus mode set in ""pro mode"" is great for daily use. The zoom feature takes beautiful macro shots all the time too. I have nothing but great things to say about the camera. When you put it in ""selfie mode"" you can hold it away from you and just say the word CHEESE and 3 seconds later it captures the photo. I bought into the phase and got a selfie stick and that makes it really cool.Overall: It's a winner. I have had people offer to trade me IPHONE 6S plus models for it and I refused. The camera is a game changer, the design and feel and durability make it the best phone; Samsung or Apple that I have had to date.",2016年3月6日 在美国审核
"Fantastic phone, no substantial improvements over Note 3","I upgraded to the Note 5 from the Note 3, expecting a leap in features. I loved my Note 3, and I love the Note 5 too, but I am admittedly disappointed that there wasn't a big leap in features—it has been 2 years since I purchased my beloved Note III, so was expecting more 'wows' 'oohs' and 'ahhs'. The Note 5 is a great phone, though I can't say that it is an improvement over the Note 3. Here's the differences:- The camera on the Note 5 has notably improved, particularly in low light photos- The battery life on the Note 5 is spectacular- The Note 5 takes longer to charge- The S pen on the Note 5 is easier to release but it has a tendency to pop itself out, since the release mechanism is activated when you push it in- The Note 3 had that sexy leather backing which was easier to grip, while the Note 5 has a plastic backing that gets covered with fingerprints and is slippery. It also makes the phone feel and look cheaper, so this was a BIG disappointment- The Note 5 has a brighter screen- The top left corner of my Note 5 is a 'touch' dead zone, though this defect may be unique to my phone- The Note 5 feels and looks narrower, though I'm not sure if it actually is - The SD card is built into the Note 5, whereas you could just buy a bigger one to insert into the Note 3** So in sum, fantastic phone, I recommend it to everyone, but not a substantial improvement over previous versions **",2016年1月6日 在美国审核
Solid product but compromised by over emphasis on shallow style and looks,"The Note5 makes a clear change in design to favor style over function, to the detriment of some features.Foe me it is a tool not a fashion accessory, especially in a plastic/rubber case.The Note series is more expensive and targeted toward high end users with the stylus and larger screen.While previous note models had an emphasis on usability but were still well built, the Note5 adopts the style first design of its primary competitors.Some of the design choices, such as the ability to insert the pen backward and break the device (requiring it to be sent to factory for repair) are alarming given the over emphasis of style.The Samsung Pay service works well and provides more places to pay but is more limited currently as to the banks supported.It is much better than other services available on the phone as it requires confirmation for all purchases.Android pay has a security problem it that there is no option to require confirmation before a purchase.A purchase is a special kind of activity and does not happen more than half a dozen times a day on average so we AT LEAST NEED a confirmation and I would prefer authentication (such as a PIN or fingerprint) on each transaction.I might also want my family to use my device without having transaction access, for example.Yes, I can create account but how many people want to configure that? Just make it simple!Samsung continues to provide an overall better UI than the standard android phone interface (as seen on the nexus), but many features have been removed.MHL was very useful for connecting to a TV reliably and works with any TV, this has sadly been removed.The power saving options have been reduced, and thus the phone can use its mid-size battery very quickly.There continues to be a wide range of junk pre-installed; it would be nice in an era of buying a phone and service separately to be able to purchase a carrier agnostic phone directly from Samsung.I don't miss the SD card expansion capability, but forgoing it for a glass body does not make sense considering the need for a bumper case around the glass anyway.What good is an over emphasized pretty body when it is covered with a full case?It remains one of the top tier devices, but there are a lot of compromises compared to previous phones.The battery discharges quickly with use and there is no option to have a bigger one so this negates the thinness of the device.I've also had some trouble with the dialer going on hold accidentally many times, so while I can use a different one I should not have to.The IR blaster was occasionally useful.Many such occasional features have been removed in a rush to market to imitate the iPhone.I would hope to see an unlocked model next year that prioritizes usage over style.",2015年12月13日 在美国审核
Now do not get me wrong I like the iPhones but apple has been having issues with ...,"I came from a iPhone 5c and I wanted something bigger in size this time. Yes apple has iPhone 6 and 6 plus, but they are still iPhones no matter what size they are. Now do not get me wrong I like the iPhones but apple has been having issues with the wireless connections for sometime since 8.2 IOS and still not fix as yet. I own a iPad2 right now and it will just loose connection to my wireless modem. My note 5 has not done that yet. I read reviews on android phones now for years. before I purchased the galaxy note 5 I went to best buy and played with the phone there asked questions etc.I have been slow in adding apps because I wanted to get to know the android OS I must say I am impressed. Coming from a static interface with I phones I can do more with my screen than put my apps in folders nice. I have had no issues with the hardware only pre-installed apps which are removed. I have installed printing apps to test them and found that one worked better then the other. I got around to installing games now though I do not install to many. Some reviews state the issue with no SD card which I almost got the note 4 but I figure having a new OS on a older phone can cause issues. I have dig into the settings and some are in sub-menus which you got to search the settings for these. I read on posts on forums that some people have installed different keyboards for texting I find that I like the one that is the default. I waited for android OS to mature and the hardware to improve and now it has and I think it will get even better with time apple may want to watch out android has converted another iPhone user. I can have a different background setting for each of my friends I text on the note 5 which no one can do with iPhone.",2016年1月19日 在美国审核
The Galaxy Note remains Supreme,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is the fifth iteration of the Note Series by Samsung. To the dismay of many consumers loyal to the note series, the Galaxy Note 5 has been released not including some of the capabilities in which its predecessors where highly favored because of. Samsung’s new device does not include the capability of micro sd expansion, nor a removable battery. If you were to take a closer look at the device, you may realize where much is loss, possibly more could be gained?",2016年4月12日 在美国审核
Wonderful BLUE phone! *Update 8/10/17,"This is probably my favorite smartphone to date.There are so many pros that it is hard to find any cons to list, but here they are:<br>Cons:This is a minor annoyance, and not really a con of the phone, but more of the description of the color, but this phone is dark blue.No, it isn't black, and calling it black sapphire is just silly.It is dark blue.No, it doesn't ""look"" blue at certain angles while actually being black most of the time like some have said on here as well as some professional reviewers.If anything, occasionally, at odd angles while looking at the phone (45 degrees to the side of it), it looks black, or if the room is really dim. But under most normal circumstances while holding it and looking dead on, it is dark blue, with a dark charcoal undertone.You will not confuse this with being a black phone, especially if you have a black background or cover on it.If you are not into dark blue phones, then avoid this color.My wife also has a white version that is a true white and looks fantastic.I also think the ""black sapphire"" is quite nice as well, just misleading.I like how upon close inspection, they got rid of the micro grid/dots of the S5 and it is a solid color when looking closely.The next con is also a minor one, but the back is a fingerprint/smudge magnet. The look is amazing with the highly reflective glass panel they chose, but suffers from the same smudge issues with glass panels like the Xperia and iphone 4/4s.If you have a cover on it, this will be a nonissue.The final con is solely a Verizon thing.How I hate Verizon and their horrible restrictive and arbitrary limitations.First, Samsung Pay beta isn't allowed on the Verizon version yet, and they won't comment on whether or not they will ever allow it, only that it won't be released on September 28th with the other carriers. Luckily, Android Pay works just fine.Most likely due to past experience, they are planning their own flawed horrible app to compete.And then, while the Note 5 is limited on bloatware compared to previous generations, Verizon (compared to AT&amp;T and TMobile) has a whole folder of its useless garbage apps on it again.Dear Verizon, your products and apps suck.Your voicemail app is horrible, your messaging app sucks, and your navigation is border line obsolete.Stop loading this garbage on there and trying to force unsuspecting geriatrics, who have got to be the only individuals clueless enough to use these products instead of superior free options.I won't take a star off for this, but if you have a choice and network coverage is available where you are, use any other carrier and do yourself a favor.Pros:First, while this is a superficial and relative opinion, I have to say that this phone just looks stunning! Well done Samsung!I can't honestly believe this phone came from Samsung.Everything from looks to build quality are probably my favorites on the market today, including HTC, Apple, and Sony phones.It is just beautiful, front to back.Despite having a 5.7 inch screen, this phone is super thin, and has tiny top and bottom bezels, and virtually nonexistent side bezels. It is very easy for me to hold, and the curved back is a perfect complement.Often, HTC, LG, and motorola put curved backs that feel good ergonomically, but bulk up the phone and look (IMO) bad.However, this phone has the looks of a flat back, thin profile, and slight curves going up on the sides.This isn't a gimmick like the S6 edge, but actually functional.And next to an Iphone 6plus, this phone is just so much better looking.Honestly, its hard to believe, but the iphone 6 plus (and new 6s) just looks under-engineered compared to this aethetically with its bloated bezels and smaller screen to size ratio. I had read several reviews and looked at several pictures commending the aesthetics of this phone and wasn't able to see what they were so thrilled about, but it isn't until you see the phone in person you understand.For whatever reason, the curved back sides and glass back just don't photograph well. However, it just feels and looks amazing in person.It is thin, sturdy, lightweight but not too light, and the metal glass combo looks fantastic, far better executed than the Xperia line (although I haven't seen the new Xperia premium).I honestly could go on and on about the looks of this phone.Next, and this has been well documented by professional reviews to include Displaymate's own personal validation, this screen is the best screen of any phone I have ever seen.Period.If you think otherwise, well, you're simply wrong and/or biased towards another manufacturer (*cough* isheep *cough*). The clarity is unreal, and the hyper realistic contrast is ridiculous.The colors just pop off the screen from any angle, and unlike some other AMOLED screens, actually look realistic when viewing pictures.Whites are white, blacks are inky black, and its hard not to find a reason to just turn the phone on and stare.Professional testing has shown that this phone has the largest color spectrum at the highest accuracy of any phone currently on the market.I have had both high resolution LCD and AMOLED, and this phone just blows them all away.Even at 40% light, this thing is extremely bright and vivid.The camera on this phone, along with the double click home button option to bring up the app, is out of this world.You simply can't take a bad picture (or at least, its really difficult to do) in almost any situation.My phone came with auto-HDR on, and honestly, it doesn't effect the speed at all.Also, even when off, or whatever app you are on, double clicking the home button and getting to your camera in under a second is brilliant.Considering I frequently reach for my DSLR, it is honestly difficult to legitimize carrying that monster around for most everyday pictures with the quality this thing is taking even in low light, with full auto! No messing with ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc.Just take out and click and enjoy amazing pictures, even in low light with no flash. Granted, it will never replace the overall ability of my DSLR for staged pictures, bokeh, and landscape shots, but for casual ""memories"", this is amazing.I debated on getting a phone without a fingerprint sensor, and honestly, I'm glad I chose this phone.The fingerprint sensor on this is blazing fast and full proof.I have not had a false read to date (except when I obviously had my finger completely off angle).Love this function as opposed to using a lock screen password or pattern.This seriously gave me heartburn because of my experience with Samsung phones and tablets in the past, but I was dreading the notorious Samsung lag.I have tried in the past years to either get a Nexus device or a lightly skinned device when possible because of this.However, this time around, (and apparently the same is true of the S6 and on), I get zero lag.I'm sure part of this is the RAM and processor combo, but it is even faster than my pure Android devices.It is all buttery smooth, snap your head back fast.I don't know if Samsung finally optimized Touchwiz and debloated it enough, or the Exynos processor is just that good (or both), but this phone is a joy to use. I will update this based on time to see if it eventually slows down.Also, while debloating their skin, they also added very useful additions like true multitasking.With the size of this screen, I frequently have two apps open at the same time.The stylus on this thing is nice, but not necessarily a necessity for me.I like being able to use it while the device is off to jot down quick notes, but not really the reason I bought it.Battery life has been good for me.It doesn't have the several day life of some of the Droid line, but is still very nice.In addition, the fast charging function of this is amazing!I can't believe how fast it charges my phone.I often put it down to charge while going to bed and get a notification that its fully charged before I completely fall asleep (it rarely goes below 5%, but from empty, expect an hour at most, and usually, it only takes 30 minutes for a full charge)!I'm sure I'm missing some other pros, but all in all, I couldn't be happier with this phone!*UPDATE 12-18-15:After a few months of use, I am still in love with this phone, probably more so.Learning any Android fun can be that way because you discover more functionality and customization options as you own it that really make the product better as you own it.The dreaded ""Samsung"" slow down hasn't happened to me yet.This phone is still blazingly fast at everything it does.The camera is still amazing, and compared to an iPhone 6s plus in side by side Christmas pictures we recently did (not a staged test), I honestly can't see how anyone would choose the iphone in a comparison test.In order to have usable pictures in dim light, the other user had to have the flash on.Auto HDR was far superior on the note5 and I was able to capture pictures in very difficult lighting that the iphone just simply couldn't.Another HUGE update for me was getting Samsung Pay finally on my phone. Verizon finally allowed the update, most likely after all of the complaining from customers. I must say, this update really is a game changer.I was casually using Android Pay before, but with this, this is simply brilliant.I have only noticed one location that can't use Samsung Pay, and that's at gas pumps.Otherwise, it works flawlessly and quickly anywhere a credit card swipe terminal exists, even if NFC isn't enabled.I can't tell you how many times I have had the cashier tell me, ""That doesn't work here"" or ""That isn't activated with us yet"" and I simply ignore them and use my phone like I would a credit card (the side swipe bar instead of the NFC terminal).Everytime, I get looks of confusion when a split second later, the transaction goes through.I get reactions from, ""Oh, i didn't know that worked, they must have activated it finally"" to ,""wow, my phone doesn't even do that!"" to just simply, ""Oh..."" and a look of confusion.The only annoying part is trying to explain to some that yes, Samsung Pay works on your outdated terminals, and no, your precious iPhone still won't be able to do it.It doesn't seem to register that an iPhone can't do something before another company.To me, this is a huge update, because I was able to slim down my wallet and only keep a backup credit card and cash for the rare occasions that this doesn't work. Otherwise, I enjoy using it because it is more secure and keeps my life less cluttered.Others may not see the benefit in paying with your smartphone as much.I also still love staring at the screen.Going to other screens will be hard after getting used to the Note5.Update 8/10/17:This phone is still AMAZING! If you can snag one at the current prices of around $350, do it, do it now. Unless you care about having the latest trendiest phone, this phone is a solid purchase at that price.Samsung has really impressed me with their newer phones.This phone is now approaching 2 years of use, and it is still zippy with no lag.I would probably have gotten the version with 64 gbs of memory, but otherwise, no complaints.It is thin, the screen is beautiful, it still looks like a very modern phone, the camera is incredible, and unlike previous generations of Samsung phones I've had, this thing is still running very smoothly.Honestly, I am hesitating on seeing a reason to ""upgrade"" to the S8, S8+, or Note8 coming up since my phone is working so beautifully. I will say that Samsung has made a repeat buyer out of me and while I still prefer to remain brand agnostic, I will definitely look at their products with confidence when I am shopping for new phones.</br>",2015年9月22日 在美国审核

Internal Battery Doesn't Last,"With battery technology improving, I was surprised how quickly this phone's internal battery time declined over only six months.The first three months it lasted all day and night under typical use.Now, at 6 months, I can barely get to the end if the day before the low battery notice comes on and it soon dies.Keep in mind that I usually just have it in my pocket all day, little phone use, and maybe a few texts, nor am I watching videos or web browsing much.I also am connected via wi-fi at work all day.One other negative, the phone just had some dead pixels come up on the screen.Hopefully, since it has only beeb 6 months, I can still at least get that fixed.It might seem minor, but if you use this phone with VR, everything is super magnified.",2016年5月31日 在美国审核

Upgraded from S6,"This is my first note series phone, just upgraded from the Galaxy S6 and I wish I just went straight for the note. The S Pen is great and so much do with this phone I am sure it will take days to find everything. Surprisingly being bigger than the S6 it fits better in the hand and does not feel as slippery as the smaller S6. The only 2 complaints I have is 1. The price is very hefty 2. The S Pen can be inserted the wrong way and do some damage so I am paranoid when putting pen back in slot. As far as the non removable battery and storage never really bothered me I would rather have internal anyway but that's just me.",2015年11月30日 在美国审核
Not worth an upgrade if you have an earlier Note - too much too loose,"In October 2015, I switched from my older Note 3 to Note 5. Now after almost 5 months, I have some good understanding of this phone, so I can provide some guidance to those who consider this model.I am an early adopter of Note series and starting with Note 1 moved to Note 2 and then Note 3. Each time it was well worth of upgrading. I passed, however, on Note 4 since with few added things I was also going to loose my faster USB3 and a few sensors (temperature and humidity) that were really useful to me. However, Note 3 metallic-covered edge got all worn out from sweet and looked really bad. I decided, it was time to upgrade.This is my second upgrade of one of the Samsung devices where I was not really happy. Before that, each time I upgraded, I gained good things - some I need, some don't. With this upgrade, I gained a bit but lost a lot. Here is a balance of good and bad things from a prospect of someone using Note 3 before.What I gained:* Nicer look - real metal, slightly curved class, not metallic-covered plastic and a flat glass of Note 3. Easier to clean, nicer look* A bit more narrow, mostly by loosing unnecessary margins, but also lost a few hairlines of screen real estate, but not critical. Better fits in hands, especially if you have small hands, better fits to a standing tray in my car* Better screen, real HD - could be good if you have young sharp eyes, but for most cases not critical, only consumes more battery life* Better front camera - and much better selfies (I guess, it could be the only real reason to upgrade). Finally, you could use selfies as real pictures.* Better main camera - but I think at that point making better main cameras doesn't matter. If you are not serious and just want to share something on FB, even Note 3 was OK. If you are serious, you will need a real camera with a reasonable lens.* A tad better sound* A bit less bloatware.Bad:- **Miserable** battery life. This is by far the worstproblem that should be critical for everyone who is interested in this model. My Note 3 could live two days with a newly charged battery. And once a battery grew older (usually in 6 months), I can plug new one in. Note 5 can't survive even one day - even if I am not doing anything serious on it. I guess finer screen and much more energy-hungry OS are responsible, otherwise, it is hard to explain why it is so bad. And my battery is still less than 6-month-old. Unfortunately, there is no way to replace the battery for Note 5 - another bad design idea - I will need to replace the whole phone in a few month.* Too little memory: No SD card with only 64GB max internal space available on the market. As a result storage space is not acceptable for any serious phone user. With Note 3, I had 32GB and 64GB card (which I could upgrade for 128GB). Now I have only 64GB with no chance to expand. I can't even fit all necessary apps and all music - had to choose. No space to get movies if you want to watch something on the road. With my Note 3 I used to have 5-6 movies that I could watch in a spare time, now I only have space for two - and with a sacrifice of music space. Remember, you do not get these 64GB even if you selected most expensive model. A lot is already used by OS and other stuff. But if you do not want a lot of music (you are always on a good connection and use Spotify) and all your movies can be streamed, for apps alone 64GB could be still OK.* Only one antenna. You can’t be online and talk at the same time unless you are using VoIP. Unfortunately, you need 4G for that - if you are in areas when 4G is spotty (and there are many), you re out of luck. Either call or work online.* This one antenna seems to be a bit worse than Note 3 antenna - I checked with two network signal apps - reception is a bit lower for Note 5. I got me scared, however, I have not noticed any issues related to it.* No USB3 - only USB2. This is a really big difference when you want to upload a new movie, but otherwise not a big issue* No sound in the USB port anymore, i.e., if you have a multimedia dock with audio output, you can't use it with Note 5, no sound. Too bad, this was my favorite way to listen to music* No infrared. Bad for me, I enjoyed using Note 3 as a remote for everything at home and office (projector!), could not be an issue for you.* No my favorite temperature and humidity sensors. Sad, I used Note 3 on a stand as a term/hygrometer. It was quite good.The last 4 features were already lost with Note 4, so if you are switching from Note 4, you do not see a difference.So, as usual,a balance of good and bad depends on your needs and current phone. If features lost in Note 5 are not critical, and those gained are, you are in a luck, although miserable battery life could be an issue for most of the potential users who are on the go. For me it was sadly a way down - too little gained, too much lost. One thing not mentioned for pro users, with Note 1-3, one was sure that it is a top-of-the line phone that has everything that competitors have and more. With Note 5, you just have a phone - one of many - with some features being better than competitors, but other worse and many critical features missing. It leaves me wondering, how Samsung might do such a poor job in designing top-of-the-line phone.​I still hope, Note 6 will change the downward trend and will be again the top phone. If not, Note 5 is likely to be my last in the line.",2016年2月21日 在美国审核
I like the stylus and the bigger screen,"I bought the Note 5 as my first smartphone at the same time I bought an S6 for my wife and 1 for my son. I like the stylus and the bigger screen. Very happy with the Note 5. Mine did need to be replaced after 18 months when it locked up during an update, but I had the insurance so mine was replaced by Verizon the next day. I'll probably get a Note 8 when they come out and put this one away so I have a spare even though Amazon says I can trade this one in for a $140.00 credit. Looking forward to the new model, but VERY satisfied with this one.",2017年8月7日 在美国审核
"So much right, Great battery, Small missteps","When I heard the Note 5 had not only a non-removable battery, but a smaller capacity compared to previous Note's, I was hesitant; especially after the S6 left a sour taste in my mouth in terms of its lasting power. But I have to say, in my short time with this device, it has impressed me. The very first day I was able to get 6 hours of Screen on Time after messing around with the phone relentlessly, installing apps, streaming music a bit, browsing the web, disabling apps, playing a few games (for maybe 40 minutes), you name it. Obviously this scenario is a bit harder on it than your normal day to day use as excessive downloading and installing of apps is fairly intensive, not to mention just playing with the new device constantly. So the first day, after charging it to 100%, it was off the charger a total of a bit over 10 hours at that point with about 10% left - but with screen on time at over 6 hours mixed with standby and all the other intensive stuff I was doing, that is a great figure which greatly eclipses what my S6 could do. Day to day it is FAR better than that though. It is clear the larger 3,000 mAh battery is not just a concession to power the larger screen and having battery life end up just matching the S6 (with its smaller ~2500 mAh battery).As it stands today, my GSam Battery Monitor app shows I get, on average, 17 hours battery life with just shy of 6 hours screen on time per complete charge. I've yet to actually run out of battery, most times having 20% or more by plug in time. So these estimates are pretty true to life, though pure standby time can see this phone last a few days easily - Samsung really upped its game on standby time on this over the S6. I never turn wifi and bluetooth off, and I have a Moto 360 connected all the time as well. You might even get slightly better life if these things don't apply to you and you keep them turned off most of the time. This phone looks as though it will not struggle to get you through a day, even under fairly heavy usage.The ""cell standby"" drain from the S6 appears to have lessened, even if not completely fixed, but at least to the point where it is no longer the biggest battery drainer (before, it had even managed to top the charts when I had 3 hours of screen on time on the S6!).Everything about the design is great, it is a nice weight without feeling too light, the rounded corners and slightly thinner width helps with one-handleability, and it is a nice step up from the all plastic build of my Note 3. It is handsome and it feels rather premium. The glass on the back does make the device feel a little bit more fragile, like you have to be more mindful and baby it some. I'd say you largely will have to be more mindful, to some degree, than you would with the previous all-plastic models. However there were concerns the all glass construction would make it far too slippery, but I don't find it too problematic. You can wrap your fingers around it pretty easily in one hand, but one handed operation where your fingers lay on the back to do most of the supporting doesn't feel too worrying either. If your hands are wet beyond a light sweat (in which case, why are you handling a smartphone lol), you'll notice the lack of grip you are probably more accustomed to on textured, plastic backed phones. But I haven't really had any issues to this point, for what that is worth.The device runs super fluid with nary a hitch to be found. Even though it has the same processor as the months old S6, I can't fault the device for not giving the processor the customary Note spec bump. It is plenty powerful and appears to be quite solid in terms of power efficiency - far more so than it appeared on the S6. I'd rather have this power/efficiency combo than a newer chip that would - more than likely - hit the battery harder. The 4 GB of RAM is nice to have, but it does seem like the overactive RAM manager still likes to kill apps, making apps require a restart rather than resume. Not always the case, but it seems to happen enough to make note of. Not a big deal to me, but it may be for others. I think this is also a battery saving measure to keep multiple apps from stacking up and unnecessarily taking CPU cycles or pinging the Internet constantly in the background.It's missing the removable battery and expandable storage, which is a knock against it - but not enough to knock a star off in my book. These are an expectation for the Note series by most, and obviously a reduction of features any way you look at it. How important they are to you depends on your usage. I have a 32 GB model after having a 32 GB Note 3 paired with a 32 GB micro SD card. I pared my glut of games back to a reasonable amount - still have a ton installed - and that's all it required for me. This was something I was doing on my Note 3, so it didn't feel like a concession when I switched to the Note 5. I also either stream music or use my iPod Touch for music, so I don't need storage for that. I don't store local video and I don't take a lot of pictures or videos, so space is fine for me. If you need more, 64 GB tops the capacity for this model and it seems pretty fair for most users. If you need more, then this is obviously going to struggle to contend for your affection since 128 GB is currently unavailable, and will be absurdly pricey when it does eventually come around.The S-Pen is still a great stylus. More responsive and far less friction on the screen than the one on my Note 3. It appears to work better for general navigation as well, requiring only a single tap (rather than a few sometimes required on my Note 3). The screen-off note writing feature is a nice one, not having to worry about the screen firing up and so on - this is a nice, immediate way to take a quick note. The features of the pop up S-Pen launcher are all familiar, excepting small tweaks to existing features like being able to take a long screen capture - say a several page webpage you'd have to scroll. The release mechanism takes a little getting used to - with the little depression it takes to get it to pop out - but once you get used to it, it works well. Any better/more secure than on the Note 3? Not to my experience, as I never had issues with the pen from the Note 3 getting accidentally pulled out, or conversely any issue getting it out of its holder. But this is a nice implementation, and adds to the slightly more refined Note experience.The base price of $700 is pretty high, but if you trade in an old phone and get the $200 credit, you're looking at a pretty fair price when matched against other phones. I am quite happy with this as an upgrade over my Note 3, and FAR happier than I was with the S6 which I had for the full 14 days before deciding to exchange it for this. If you take stock of everything you may just realize that, for you at least, the ire drawn by Internet power users is not quite that crippling or straight up device-ruining. I miss the two removed features, largely because I would rather have access to the battery to replace if the cells start going later on in the phone's life, but right now I'm quite happy with the package as it stands and have no qualms recommending it.",2015年8月25日 在美国审核

"So much right, Great battery, Small missteps","When I heard the Note 5 had not only a non-removable battery, but a smaller capacity compared to previous Note's, I was hesitant; especially after the S6 left a sour taste in my mouth in terms of its lasting power. But I have to say, in my short time with this device, it has impressed me. The very first day I was able to get 6 hours of Screen on Time after messing around with the phone relentlessly, installing apps, streaming music a bit, browsing the web, disabling apps, playing a few games (for maybe 40 minutes), you name it. Obviously this scenario is a bit harder on it than your normal day to day use as excessive downloading and installing of apps is fairly intensive, not to mention just playing with the new device constantly. So the first day, after charging it to 100%, it was off the charger a total of a bit over 10 hours at that point with about 10% left - but with screen on time at over 6 hours mixed with standby and all the other intensive stuff I was doing, that is a great figure which greatly eclipses what my S6 could do. Day to day it is FAR better than that though. It is clear the larger 3,000 mAh battery is not just a concession to power the larger screen and having battery life end up just matching the S6 (with its smaller ~2500 mAh battery).As it stands today, my GSam Battery Monitor app shows I get, on average, 17 hours battery life with just shy of 6 hours screen on time per complete charge. I've yet to actually run out of battery, most times having 20% or more by plug in time. So these estimates are pretty true to life, though pure standby time can see this phone last a few days easily - Samsung really upped its game on standby time on this over the S6. I never turn wifi and bluetooth off, and I have a Moto 360 connected all the time as well. You might even get slightly better life if these things don't apply to you and you keep them turned off most of the time. This phone looks as though it will not struggle to get you through a day, even under fairly heavy usage.The ""cell standby"" drain from the S6 appears to have lessened, even if not completely fixed, but at least to the point where it is no longer the biggest battery drainer (before, it had even managed to top the charts when I had 3 hours of screen on time on the S6!).Everything about the design is great, it is a nice weight without feeling too light, the rounded corners and slightly thinner width helps with one-handleability, and it is a nice step up from the all plastic build of my Note 3. It is handsome and it feels rather premium. The glass on the back does make the device feel a little bit more fragile, like you have to be more mindful and baby it some. I'd say you largely will have to be more mindful, to some degree, than you would with the previous all-plastic models. However there were concerns the all glass construction would make it far too slippery, but I don't find it too problematic. You can wrap your fingers around it pretty easily in one hand, but one handed operation where your fingers lay on the back to do most of the supporting doesn't feel too worrying either. If your hands are wet beyond a light sweat (in which case, why are you handling a smartphone lol), you'll notice the lack of grip you are probably more accustomed to on textured, plastic backed phones. But I haven't really had any issues to this point, for what that is worth.The device runs super fluid with nary a hitch to be found. Even though it has the same processor as the months old S6, I can't fault the device for not giving the processor the customary Note spec bump. It is plenty powerful and appears to be quite solid in terms of power efficiency - far more so than it appeared on the S6. I'd rather have this power/efficiency combo than a newer chip that would - more than likely - hit the battery harder. The 4 GB of RAM is nice to have, but it does seem like the overactive RAM manager still likes to kill apps, making apps require a restart rather than resume. Not always the case, but it seems to happen enough to make note of. Not a big deal to me, but it may be for others. I think this is also a battery saving measure to keep multiple apps from stacking up and unnecessarily taking CPU cycles or pinging the Internet constantly in the background.It's missing the removable battery and expandable storage, which is a knock against it - but not enough to knock a star off in my book. These are an expectation for the Note series by most, and obviously a reduction of features any way you look at it. How important they are to you depends on your usage. I have a 32 GB model after having a 32 GB Note 3 paired with a 32 GB micro SD card. I pared my glut of games back to a reasonable amount - still have a ton installed - and that's all it required for me. This was something I was doing on my Note 3, so it didn't feel like a concession when I switched to the Note 5. I also either stream music or use my iPod Touch for music, so I don't need storage for that. I don't store local video and I don't take a lot of pictures or videos, so space is fine for me. If you need more, 64 GB tops the capacity for this model and it seems pretty fair for most users. If you need more, then this is obviously going to struggle to contend for your affection since 128 GB is currently unavailable, and will be absurdly pricey when it does eventually come around.The S-Pen is still a great stylus. More responsive and far less friction on the screen than the one on my Note 3. It appears to work better for general navigation as well, requiring only a single tap (rather than a few sometimes required on my Note 3). The screen-off note writing feature is a nice one, not having to worry about the screen firing up and so on - this is a nice, immediate way to take a quick note. The features of the pop up S-Pen launcher are all familiar, excepting small tweaks to existing features like being able to take a long screen capture - say a several page webpage you'd have to scroll. The release mechanism takes a little getting used to - with the little depression it takes to get it to pop out - but once you get used to it, it works well. Any better/more secure than on the Note 3? Not to my experience, as I never had issues with the pen from the Note 3 getting accidentally pulled out, or conversely any issue getting it out of its holder. But this is a nice implementation, and adds to the slightly more refined Note experience.The base price of $700 is pretty high, but if you trade in an old phone and get the $200 credit, you're looking at a pretty fair price when matched against other phones. I am quite happy with this as an upgrade over my Note 3, and FAR happier than I was with the S6 which I had for the full 14 days before deciding to exchange it for this. If you take stock of everything you may just realize that, for you at least, the ire drawn by Internet power users is not quite that crippling or straight up device-ruining. I miss the two removed features, largely because I would rather have access to the battery to replace if the cells start going later on in the phone's life, but right now I'm quite happy with the package as it stands and have no qualms recommending it.",2015年8月25日 在美国审核
Samsung - updated quality - battery life decreased after marshmellow,I purchased this phone at BestBuy during the Pre-Black Friday sale this last year for $75.00.Benefits of the Note 5 are that it feels like a much nicer phone than the previous models. Screen size has stayed consistent and is nice when your vision is sub-par. charging port and audio jack have not shown any signs of wear after 7 months of use. The phone originally shipped with lollipop but I received the marshmellow update after about 5 months of having the device (around march is when it updated). After the update the battery life has decreased noticeably. The screen does not scratch easily even without a screen protector. I did purchase one but the glass screen protector broke shortly after putting it on the phone. All in all a pretty good phone.,2016年5月19日 在美国审核
Simple and easy to use,"Fast response in shipping the phone.Simple and easy to use.Great for older people. Not loaded with not needed or wanted apps.The only draw back so far is the ring volume.It is not as loud as it should be even when volume control is at the max.However, if I ever needed another phone I would not hesitate to purchase another or even an upgrade someday.",2018年5月22日 在美国审核
"Big screen, nice camera, but plagued by too many problems.","Wow, this phone was a huge disappointment. There are so many flaws with this phone, so I will break my review down into several areas.Large ScreenI initially bought this because I wanted to have a phone with a large screen. In that area, the phone does not disappoint. It is easier to read and less of a strain on the eyes than my smaller-by-comparison iPhone 5s. So in this area, the Note 5 is a big winner, hence 2 stars.CameraThe camera is superior to those on my previous phones, iPhone 5s being the latest... in quality that is. The focus is so bad I would almost call it broken. Other cameras I had would take relatively close pictures. Anything closer than a meter/yard gives me trouble and the image keeps going in and out of focus. Not to mention the camera often gets stuck in ""focus mode"" where it wants you to adjust the focus instead of being able to take a picture. This is really annoying, and happens a lot for me. Going back to the quality, this phone takes GREAT selfies. Yes, the caps are justified. While I don't take many, the ones I do take have some kind of softening filter or something that makes your skin look better in the images. It seems to erase small blemishes, tired eye bags, etc. It won't make you look 50 years younger, but it definitely makes a difference. My rating: great camera, annoying focus problems.Touch Screen and Side ButtonsThis this is sensitive. I can nudge any button and it usually goes off. The initial unlock screen is annoying. It takes me 3-4 attempts sometimes to access the phone. The hold option on the phone app is poorly placed to say the least. If you touch your face to the phone, you have a good chance of hitting the hold option by accident. You may thing something is wrong, so anytime things go silent, you'll look at the phone and wonder what is going on. The green color will be grey, and you'll see the phone is on hold. Unless you are taking and transferring calls for a business, then a hold option isn't so useful. Mute works wonders, and you can auto-hold calls when another is coming in. The text keyboard, for a phone this size, is really bad and inaccurate. I could type almost flawlessly on my smaller iPhone 5s. On this thing I constantly misspell words. Which brings us to...Auto-correctI turned it off after a week. I don't like the last word I type corrected to something inappropriate AFTER I click the send button. The suggestions were often wrong, and sometimes even when I clicked the right suggestion, the wrong word came up. And don't even think about using slang, it'll auto-correct you into all sorts of things. A suggestion only option would be nice, but for some reason it didn't work for me. That's a pity too, because spell check is something I use a lot when I email.ConnectivityThis is one of the phone's biggest flaws. I'm on my second Note 5 in 6 months, because the first one had such terrible connectivity issues from day one. I have tried it in multiple states, rural and urban areas, wooded and open areas, you get the idea. The connectivity is inferior to all of my past phones. I often lose calls over 30 minutes, and drop a few calls a week. Sometimes, your voice simply doesn't transmit anymore and you are forced to hangup. This often happens when using the hold option.The StylusUnless you are an artist, this thing is a terrible idea. You remove it by pushing on it, so if you keep this in your pocket, purse, bag, etc. it may accidentally release the stylus... which also opens a memo program for you to write on. Multiple stores have told me that if you put the stylus back in wrong you can mess it up, so I don't really see a point to the thing. Again, if you really want to do art on your phone, maybe it works for you. This should have been an optional trait.Battery LifeIt's like an electric car... you'll probably have to charge it every night. It's not that big of a deal, but other phones I had got 2-3 days, so, yeah. Not a deal breaker though. And for the record, I always close my apps, and have 2 non-factory apps on my phone.Wireless ConnectionThis phone LOVES finding wireless options and suggesting them to you... in the middle of texting, blocking you from typing until you acknowledge its great discovery. It also loves to, by default, connect to unsecured networks. If you live anywhere in the vicinity of people who may like to get into your phone (which is most anywhere), this is a really bad idea. I had to disconnect my searching feature because of this, and it's annoying to have to turn it on every time I drive between home and other places I have a secure connection.ConclusionFind another option. The big screen and camera are nice. The intermittent connectivity, touch screen issues, hold option problems, wireless connection finder, low battery life, stylus, and bad auto-correct are too much of a hassle to recommend this phone. There are many other fine options out there, so do yourself a favor and research some other phone models.",2016年4月10日 在美国审核
I gave it a try.,"So after being an iphone user, i wanted to try out a samsung phone. I recently have been using the iphone 6 plus and the note 5 seemed to be the most similar in size and features. i'm just leaving my honest review and experiences of trying an android phone out.First, the likes. The S-Pen is amazing! Apple really needs one of these. The beauty camera and all the different modes are great. The glass back feels premium. The screen quality is different and looks amazing compared to the iphone. I like the widgets feature, another thing apple needs to incorporate. Swipe keyboard. The touch id seems to register better. Feels more premium than the iphone. 32gb is the lowest memory storage they offer, while apple still wants to offer only 16gb as their lowest. (come on apple, more storage for the money)Dislikes. It feels on average the data usage is more on android than iphone, even with restricted background usage. No scroll to top function, I keep on accidentally touching the switcher and back button. Verizon note 5 is not rootable. Freezes more than the iphone. Need to get a separate gmail app and the stock samsung/android apps doesn't seem as good as stock ios apps. The s-pen gets stuck if put in backwards.In the end, I stayed with my iphone. I gave android/Samsung a try and though I really like a lot of stuff that it has to offer (especially the S-Pen), the ios software just seems to be more useful and fluid to me.",2015年10月11日 在美国审核

The differences between the two are negligible, and the fact that is slimmer by a mm or two, is not really a justification to buy the Note 5 over the Note 4.It is my hope that Samsung takes heed of this and goes back to providing loyal users like myself the removable battery, the SD card and IR blaster for the Note 6 and above.

This phone has 4 GBs of memory RAM and it still behaves as if it had 1GB or less. Every 3rd or 4th application you open is shut down by the system. Nothing stays in memory, so everything must reload. This is supposed to be the KING of multitasking phones. The phone that can replace your notebook, your laptop and your tablet. But it fails miserably at it. There is ALWAYS a HANG. To make matters worse, if you buy from VERIZON or ATT, you cannot fix this issue by rooting (gaining access to system modifications) because the phone's bootloader (the part used to install faster and newer operating systems or modifications into the phone) is LOCKED DOWN and both companies will not unlock it for you. In other words, the PHONE IS NEVER YOURS. Not even after you pay for it!To make matters even worse, Google has released the new operating system, Android 6.0, with lots of new features and SECURITY FIXES against hackers, worms, and malicious software that would steal your information. Samsung is notoriously known for taking MONTHS to update their phones. Once they do, it must still go through VERIZON and ATT, which takes MONTHS. You may be looking at 10-12 months before any fixes come your way.In today's world, you don't want to be without software updates.I had to go back to my Note 4 from ATT and it still has no update to Android 5.1.1 (has been released now, but not yet reached my Note 4). It's been 12 months. No fixes for the terrible stagefright malicious software, and it is now VERY SLOW. Upon calling ATT to request they unlock my boot loader - THEY SAID NOT POSSIBLE. But the phone is mine. I paid $830. What do you mean? You won't update my phone, and neither let ME do it?Thank but no thanks. Will not do it again. You guys lost a customer for good. Moved to T-Mobile right after returning the phone.For those downvoting this review: Please comment on what inaccuracies I have written here. Everything written in this review IS ACCURATE as of October 16, 2015.",2015年10月16日 在美国审核

Sending Back,"The phone is amazing with the exception of the following:1. I have been a Note user since the first Note came out and this Note 5 is being returned. First off no removable batter... so when your phone freezes... and it will... what do you do? Waste an hour on the phone holding to speak with someone. No thanks.2. The battery is actually SMALLER than the Note 4 and let me tell you... HUGE difference. My Note 4 lasted allllllll day with extreme usage. My Note 5 last 8-9 hours, so by 2pm I am having to charge it again. What moron thunk up the idea to give it a smaller battery? SMH. I would rather have a slightly thicker phone than charge my phone all day.3. This was my deal breaker. FINALLY Samsung gives you almost unlimited panel/screens. I just kept adding panel after panel to hold all my widgets and such. I was over the moon excited....until.... I realized that in order to get to any panel/screen you have to literally swipe panel by panel to get to it with the exception of the home screen which you can get to with a tap of the center button. WTCrap? Seriously!?! So in order to view my email widget located 5 panels/screens past the home screen I would have to swipe over 4 times verses like ALL THE OTHER Notes you press the little white button at the bottom of all panels and it takes you directly there. What a HUGE disappointment. I would spend all day swiping from one side of my phones panels to the next.",2015年8月28日 在美国审核

SAMSUNG BLEW IT!,"1 star because they went backward. What are you thinking?You have a hand up on apple and then you blow it and go backward by taking away the removable battery and also the SD card. All to add some money to your coffer. On top of this you cannot root the Verizon or AT&amp;T Note5. I think some of these review are Fake, how could people praise this. My friend canceled his order because of this. You lose way more than you gain! Samsung I love your phones, the picture quality and touchwiz but I hate how you did this. This ones gonna bite back. You BLEW IT on this one!I went to post this same review on Verizon Wireless and they would not post it because it would hurt the sales. If they won't post mine they won't post other bad reviews also.

Der Hammer! Note 7 Alternative!,"Habe dieses Gerät vom amerikanischen Händler ""Elektronik Kaufen"" bestellt. Der Versand erfolgt über Amazon.de also keine Sorgen machen, ist alles Seriös und schnell!Das Gerät selber ist wie beschrieben. Aufpassen es handelt sich um ein AT&amp;T Gerät (920A) ohne Simlock. Wer also Root und Custom Roms will braucht die internationale Version.V e r a r b e i t u n g :Das Handy ist sehr hochwertig verarbeitet und fühlt sich teuer an. Die Knöpfe sitzen alle fest und haben einen sehr guten Druckpunkt. Sie geben ein metallisches Klicken von sich wenn man sie drückt. Der S-Pen kommt auf Knopfdruck aus dem Handy. 5/5S o f t w a r e :Android 6.0.1 wie auf jedem anderen aktuellen Samsung Gerät. Paar nette AT&amp;T Apps die leider nur teilweise in Deutschland funktionieren.Läuft sehr flüssig, Multitasking funktioniert einwandfrei, S-Note und weitere S-Pen Funktionen sind wie bei den Vorgängern vorhanden.Nimmt man den Stift bei ausgeschaltetem Display aus dem Gerät, so aktiviert sich das Display (schwarzer Hintergrund) und man kann direkt Notizen schreiben (weiße Schrift, gut lesbar). Diese werden Gespeichert wenn man den Stift einsteckt oder das Gerät entsperrt.Bei meiner AT&amp;T Version kommen die Updates nicht von Samsung sondern von AT&amp;T5/5P e r f o r m a n c e :Braucht man nicht lange drüber reden, besser gehts kaum. Vergleichbar mit dem S7.Alles läuft schnell und nichts ruckelt. Selbst Spiele wie Mortal Kombat laufen ohne Probleme. 5/5A k k u :Die Akkulaufzeit ist in Ordnung. Einen Tag schafft man. Hier hätte man ruhig einen größeren Akku verbauen können.Ist zur Zeit mein größter Kritikpunkt an vielen Handys. Daher4/5K a m e r a :Die Selbe wie beim S6 Edge Plus. Einfach perfekt. 5/5F a z i t :Für 379€ bekommt man hier eine sehr gute und günstige Alternative zum Galaxy Note 7 und dem fast baugleichen Galaxy S6 Edge Plus.Würde ich weiter empfehlen!",2016年10月21日 在德国审核

The first ‘real’ budget phone that’s worth the money,"OVERVIEWThe Huawei Honor 5x is the first of its kind. It’s not a game changer in terms of the latest and the greatest. It’s a game changer in that it’s the first ‘real’ low cost phone that has a metal body, large battery, beautiful screen, fingerprint reader, decent cameras, and a decent processor.For the longest time, phone makers reserved metal smartphones and fingerprint readers for their ‘flagship’ models. Only those who pay $600+ (un-subsidized) would have the luxury of accessing those new features. The Huawei Honor 5x was designed to disrupt that philosophy.For reference, my previous phones were:Nexus 5Oneplus OneOneplus TwoNexus 5xVALUEAt a very low $200 price point at launch, the Honor 5x is currently one of the best values in terms of specs, features, build material and support. To get to that price point, Huawei had to cut back on a few things like NFC, a faster processor and a camera quality. This may sound like a huge deal breaker, and it may as well be if you’re coming from a flagship phone from any other maker, but at $200, what the Honor 5x is able to pack into the phone is way better than any other phone in that same price range. (Name a metal high quality phone with a fingerprint reader that can be purchased at $200 at launch day. 02/05/2016)SPEED***Update 02/19/2016 After nearly 20 days using this phone as my primary phone, I'm finally ready to comment on the performance. Comparing the Honor 5x with my previous phone, the Nexus 5x, I would have to say that they seem identical. I actually haven't notice any significant lag on the Honor 5x whereas with my Nexus 5x, I've notice significant lag with similar apps. Just as a disclosure, I do not play mobile games much so I can't vouch whether this phone would be great for gaming. ***FINGERPRINT READERThe Honor 5x’s fingerprint reader is pretty snappy. I can and probably will say that it’s quicker than the Nexus 5x’s fingerprint reader. Every time I’ve used it to unlock the phone, it’s done so smoothly and without any issues. What’s neat about their fingerprint software is that they’ll allow you assign specific privacy settings or actions per finger. An example is that I have set my left hand middle finger to unlock the phone in Guest Mode. This will hide all the apps I would prefer to be private (ie. Amazon, whatsapp, tinder, okcupid, etc). What I have noticed though is that when opening up in ‘Guest Mode’, the apps that are marked private will be viewable for a second before they disappear. This may be the limitation of the processor or maybe the coding in the software. Hopefully this is something that can be updated in future updates.CAMERAThe Honor 5x’s camera isn’t the best in low light. So far a majority of my shots has been indoors of my dog and food, and I’ve found that the images look a bit dull. The camera is quick. Quicker than the Nexus 5x camera, but I don’t think it’s as vivid as it could be in low light.ALUMINUM METAL BODYThe most noticeable feature of the Honor 5x would have to be the metal body. Huawei used quality build materials for this phone and it shows. It feels and looks like a premium phone.3000mAh BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on the Honor 5x is forever. It has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S Plus which says a thing or two about a thing or two. So going 1.5 days of casual use without charging is doable. The only real downside is that the phone doesn’t utilize quick charging. I suppose you’ll rarely need it with a battery this size, but most people these days have power anxiety whenever they see a phone with less than 50%. Granted for the Honor 5x, 50% will last at least another half day, it’s oddly comforting to know that the phone is floating around 80-100% power.BLOATWEARMy biggest and only real complaint about this phone is Huawei’s Launcher EMUI. It’s heavy and full of apps and junk I prefer not to have. It’s as if Huawei was targeting price conscious iPhone users who would be willing to make the switch. It’s not a deal breaker for me as I know someone will eventually find a way to load pure Android onto the phone. In the meantime, I would RECOMMEND anybody who purchases this to download the Google Now Launcher or any other launcher. This won't completely mask the Huawei's feature, but it'll make the phone more manageable. I have yet to experience any significant lag with the Google Now Launcher with this phone.RECOMMENDATIONS1. Would I recommend this phone?Most definitely2. Would I recommend it to everybody?Probably not. If you’re coming from a faster flagship phone, I would tell you to keep your phone.3. Who is this phone for?This phone is an easy upgrade for any android user who hasn’t upgraded their phone in the last year. Those who are okay with having a second or third tiered phone. Those who are looking for the ‘bang for their buck’. The Huawei Honor 5x is a game changer in terms of value.[...] Thank you!",2016年2月6日 在美国审核
Huawei Honor 5X is the great phone.......,"Excellent smartphone, availability to upgrade to the latest Android OS is a great option. Everything is working fine, 2Sim+Memory (up to 128Gb) is the option that you will have hard time to find in any unlocked phone with US warranty. Price is also very good for what you get. Could not find any negative sides of the phone yet. Charging cable could be flat then would not be so looped.After few months of using the phone I have to change my 5 Star into 2 Star, following problems were noticed:a) when fonts are set for small after while, sms text size is getting huge, you have to reset the phone's font size, but after while same story again on 2 phones.b) Manufacturer states that: This is the first phone to feature two fully compatible 4G LTE SIM slots: nano-SIM, micro-SIM. In reality only 1 card can be set for4G LTE SIM, other card can handle 2G only. But my phone can't handle 4G LTE even in 1 card only when 2nd SIM card is inserted &amp; set for 2G only. When 2nd SIM card (as Card 1 &amp; set for 2G) is inserted, my 1st SIM card (set as Card 2 &amp; set for 4G LTE) is losing APN (phone is removing 4G LTE APN) and I am losing 4G LTE and phone Internet fully until I remove SIM card from Slot 2 card (set for 2G).c) So phone can't handle even one 4G LTE with 2 SIM cards inserted. T-Mobile Tech asked me to contact Huawei Manufacturer since looks how is there software / firmware / bugs problem &amp; need to be resolve. I contacted Huawei US Suport for first time, my problem has been ignored completely and looks how they like to go into circles avoiding the problems by ignorance.d) If my problem will be resolve I change my review back to 5 stars, for now I can offer 1 star because problems I am having and lock of Huawei Customer Support",2016年12月14日 在美国审核
"Good phone for the money, but lots of slowdowns...","I really wanted to love this phone. The looks are great. The camera is ok for the price. It's hard to find good devices at this price point with a fingerprint sensor (excluding recent motorolas). I needed a dual sim device because my wife and I are moving overseas to work in a country where it's needed. I also like to root my devices and install Lineage OS on them for more customization and a stock android experience, so this device was perfect for that, especially since EMUI 5 is not coming to this device and you're stuck on Marshmallow. The stock UI wasn't terrible, if you can put a better launcher on it and not do the whole crazy app screen thing Apple does. But I just really enjoy stock android better than all the other skins. I bought it used - Like New, and other than coming with so much grease on the display that it looked like the previous owner was eating taco bell when he packed it up, it came in good condition with all the packaging.Pros:Battery Life was great. I got at least 5 hours screen on time most days, unless I did a lot of GPS or games.Easily unlock the bootloader and install LineageOS 7.1.2 Android Nougat.Display isn't bad, but isn't as sharp as more expensive devices, and blacks aren't great (get a glass screen protector because not having oleophobic coating makes it look nasty)Feels nice in the hand, sturdy build, nice weight to it and width. Isn't as unwieldy as other 5.5inch displays.Fingerprint is one of the best i've used, apple or android.Cons:Weird RAM management. Even on stock android, the device always had 1.4 or more of the 2.0gb used. This was really weird because I came from a Motorola phone with a very similar processor and 2.0gb of memory and didn't have this issue. It would slow down very quickly if I used google now or assistant or maps while having any other apps open. Sometimes it'd take like ten seconds to recognize i clicked something. This was both on EMUI and LineageOS. I was disappointed it didn't' get better with stock android. Would be a great phone if it was the 3gb model the rest of the world recieved.EMUI - It's not for everyone, check out how to root and install LineageOS if you're adventurous.No fast charging. It didn't take forever to charge, but with that size of battery, It was a stark contrast to all the devices with quick charge now.Really wanted to love this phone. Looks really nice. Ended up just getting the LeEco S3 for $138 to try it out, since it has a much better processor SD652 and 3gb of memory, and can probably handle tasks much better. I'll try it out for a few weeks and see how it does. It's UI is worse than Huawei, so I definitely flashed LineageOS onto it also.",2017年11月21日 在美国审核
Best deal on a budget phone in the $200 price range,"Excellent phone for the price, very fast, beautiful display, fingerprint scan to unlock is less than a half-second.The mixed reviews about:-underpowered cpu-lack of 2k/4k display-overall performanceAre generally from comparisons against flagship &lt;top-of-the-line&gt; devices, the performance of this device lands squarely between a galaxy s4 and s5 but with a pricetag cheaper than either.Complaints about EMUI 3.x are largely unfounded, it's very customizable, fast, and for the most part glitch-free but it does have a bad reputation from older versions of the launcher. People like to trash-talk it still, but honestly it's one of the better factory launchers and you can always use a 3rd party one if you prefer. Once you are familiar with the UI &lt;which takes about 24 hours&gt; then you will fully appreciate how clean and smooth it really is, but you will spend a large part of that first day trying to find where everything is.Camera has many options and takes excellent pictures in all but the harshest conditions &lt;very low light&gt;, burst shooting mode will snap 10 pictures per second so a large sdhc card is recommended :)Honor is currently accepting beta test applicants for Android Marshmellow and EMUI 4.x, the phone will be upgrading to both but with no scheduled release date currently.Tmobile band 12 is still currently deactivated until a deal can be struck, blame the lawyers for the delay. 4GLTE works flawlessly with AT&amp;T if you have the carried option in your area.For anyone seriously considering this phone you should also order a tempered glass screen protector and immediately replace the factory plastic one, basically it's just shipped with it so the screen is protected from initial use but it should be replaced with a real GLASS protector asap.",2016年3月13日 在美国审核
"Decent phone, just pray your battery never needs replacing!","Bought mine just a little over 3 years ago.Great phone for the price at the time, and not too many issues along the way.But upon having a charging issue overnight and looking like it needs a new battery, my happiness is over.Everyone else I know have easy removable, replaceable batteries....but not this one!After much internet research and one Youtube video, looks like I not only need to buy a replacement battery, but also a complete set of mini tools.Then comes a 30-60 minute job of removing microscopic screws, cables, etc and reversing the process after the new battery goes in.All the while hoping that you do not disrupt or break any of the many parts that are in the way.Basically looks like gutting the inside of your laptop and reversing the process.STUPIDEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN!IDIOTIC DESIGN!No battery replacement should ever be this complicated.So, now I have to decide on whether to purchase the parts and tackle the project, or just buy another phone......but sadly, not this one!",2020年11月28日 在美国审核

One of the best phones I've ever owned.,"Been using the phone for about a week and other than installing a launcher app from the Play Store, this phone is unbelievable.I was skeptical about the fingerprint reader but I was blown away by how quickly it reads the fingerprint.Any owners of a Samsung S6 or S7 knows their fingerprint reader is very temperamental.But it was not the case with this one.Though the specs of this phone don't exactly make it a ''flagship'' phone, it is still an extremely quick and responsive phone.The best way to describe this phone in my opinion is that it's a underrated phone.Looking at the specs of this phone on paper seems underwhelming but once again, that is not the case.I have yet to experience any lag whatsoever.The screen is bright and sharp.Battery life is stronger that you would expect.Speaker volume is very loud, both the earpiece speaker and also the speakerphone.Build quality is sturdy and very good.Like I mentioned earlier, I did install a launcher but that's only cause I paid for it and might as well use it.But over time, a user would have no issues getting used to the UI that Huawei uses.So far I can't think of anything that would make me dislike this phone.I've owned a few phones that were once considered ''flagship'' by their manufacturer, (HTC M7, LG G3, Samsung S6 &amp; S7...) and I actually regret ever getting a Samsung S7 when I could have gotten this for about 1/3rd of the price.I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for something budget friendly simply because I feel like you're definitely going to get A LOT more than you paid.",2017年2月4日 在美国审核

Fast Metal Android Phone w/finger-print sensor. No 5GHz WiFi,"Had this 3 weeks now. Previously 2 years with a Nexus 4, i'm on T-Mobile USA.Pros:Great screen, with a factory fitted screen protector on it, no bubbles.Lovely metal back. Spoilt a bit by a small serial-number sticker.Finger print sensor, that is fast for me. Never knew how nice it was to unlock using a finger on the back on the phone, and typing in my PIN is now a pain.Huawei's own launcher/desktop EMUI that does not have an app draw. All your apps are on one of the screens. Don't like that, but otherwise fine. Has some nice hidden features. The launcher is a little laggy, closing some apps goes to a black screen then the background appears.Fast and responsive, except for the phone dialer! Not sure why, but dialing phone numbers is very laggy, typing in the chrome browser is laggy too, but that may be chrome or the keyboard.Comes with Huawei's own apps. Own web browser and email and camera. I use google's chrome browser, gmail, and camera from the app store.4G LTE connects are great.WiFi is very good, but now picks up all sorts of public networks my old phone didn't as the bus ride home passes hotels and hospitals. Phone tries to connect to them and switches out of 4GLTE, and i loose the internet.I need wifi on for work and home, but don't want it auto connecting to other networks.Great power use. Battery lasts me about 3 days, the Nexus4 lasted 0.8 of a day. Good battery monitoring and notifications. Good app control when the screen powers off.Huaweis camera is fast, takes the picture the moment you press the button. Offers panorama and other camera extras. Googles camera is 2Meg per picture, Huawei's at the same resolution is 3Meg per picture.Neutral:Not the latest Android, one back, but fine.Cons:No clock app!?You have to install a clock widget if you want to use the alarm clock or stop watch.No airplane mode in the quick settings. Takes 5 swipes/clicks to get in/out of airplane mode.Micro USB for chargingOnly seems to have 2.4GHz wifi. No 5GHz wifi!?No Gyroscope sensor, so googles camera does not offer photo sphere or panorama. Disappointing. Googles camera is slow, takes 0.5+++ seconds to refocus etc and take a picture.Very happy with it overall. Great call quality, great screen, good camera, fast, lovely design, finger print unlock. Had to get a case as i was too worried about scratching it. The case changed the way i held it and had to re-train on my fingerprints. Can learn 5 sets, &amp; it is quick to do.",2016年4月6日 在美国审核
"Excellent Deal, 5 Stars Except For Non-US Bluetooth","There is a lot that this phone does well. With a few notable exceptions discussed below, this is a 5 Star product. The call quality is excellent, the video quality is great, the headphone sound is great, the external speakers are great, and the camera takes good pictures (I assume – there are others more interested in photography that could get more detailed with that). I like the size of the phone, as I spend a good deal of time with it watching videos. There are some nice Huawei features also.But there are a couple of things that get into the very annoying region, and a few things that are not a huge deal but unfortunate.Most importantly, the Bluetooth doesn’t work properly for US compatibility. There are two instances in my life where I really want Bluetooth to work, and on this phone they don't. One is in my car. I have a 2015 Accord with a Bluetooth Hands Free Link, and while the media will play over Bluetooth (music, apps, etc.), the phone feature does not function correctly. My contacts, call history, and text messages all come through Bluetooth, and I can place a call or answer a call with my car’s HFL buttons, but the actual conversation over the phone does not go through the Bluetooth connection and I have to pick up the phone and hold it to my ear, which defeats the purpose.Similarly, I have a Panasonic home phone system that is supposed to link to my wife’s and my mobile phones via Bluetooth, and the Huawei Bluetooth does not work with it. The Panasonic system will give a notification of incoming texts (as it is supposed to), but I can’t pick up or place calls with the Panasonic handsets (which I should be able to). And when I pick up or place a call with the Huawei phone when it is connected to the Panasonic system, the other party can’t hear me or I can’t hear them or speak to them.I’ve spent a lot of time with customer service about this (the Huawei US customer service chat is excellent, by the way), with Huawei and with Honda and Panasonic for these respective issues, and I think we’ve determined that there is the US Bluetooth and the Rest Of The World Bluetooth – they don’t necessarily work with each other, and it appears that Huawei uses the Rest Of The World Bluetooth.Now the items that are not a huge deal but unfortunate.First, the Huawei music player app does not play the files that all of my music is in. iTunes saves their files as WAV or something, and I had to download a third party app (VLC Player). Annoying, I have to deal with ads, but otherwise a suitable workaround.Second, when I first got the phone my text messages could not be loaded from my previous phone with my Google account. I had to again download a third party app on both my old phone and the Huawei, select it as my default message service, save my messages in it, load them into the Huawei, then re-select whichever sms service I wanted to use.Third, the camera, microphone, and Google Search are somehow malfunctioning so that when Google is allowed use of the microphone in the app settings, when you turn on any other app that uses the microphone (video for instance), a box comes up saying “Google search box will not be able to record audio” or something like that, and in video mode, when you press ok, the video stops on its own (which I don't want when my kids are doing something cute or I'm doing something that can't be repeated). This box comes up every three seconds while you’re in the app using the microphone. Again, I’ve spent a lot of time on customer service about this, and Google customer service thinks (and I agree) that this phone is not using the most current version of Google. But it’s the only one available through Huawei’s updater, so there you are.Fourth, and least bothersome, is that the computer interface, called Hi Suite, which allows you to manage stuff like videos, apps, and pictures on your phone. Mysteriously it does not have any controls for music management. You have to manually go into wherever your music is stored on your computer and copy it to the phone’s music folder via file explorer (I don’t know how it works with Mac).Lastly, the fingerprint scanner is really cool and works well without a case on the phone, but if you decide to use a case (which I can’t really do without – I love the finish of the phone, but it’s SO thin and SO smooth that I can’t hardly hold onto it!), it’s hard to get your finger into the hole in the case to use the scanner. You also have to have a screen lock with pin or password activated to use most of the fingerprint features. Practically speaking, I don’t like having a pin because I’m getting into my phone about 500 times a day, and I want to get in quickly. The fingerprint will unlock it, but again, it’s hard to get your finger in there with a case. So if you don’t have a pin, you can’t save your own fingerprints, which means you can’t use most of the fingerprint scanner features. You can still use it to do things like go to home screen, go back, go to the open apps page, and maybe one or two other things.All in all, it’s a very good phone, and you can’t beat the price for the features. I just wish that the Bluetooth worked. I really hate for Bluetooth-that-works to be the only difference between this and a phone that’s $400 more expensive, but that seems to be mostly what it is (although, if you don’t use Bluetooth a lot, then you’ve found a great deal!!). It turns out that I use Bluetooth a LOT, and when it doesn’t work exactly as it should, it’s very frustrating.",2017年10月19日 在美国审核
Great Phone for the price and is beautiful.,"Great phone works perfect. Love the finger print reader you can save up to 5 finger to do some things on phone. Like unlock, open apps, or call someone. I bought two of them, and will not suggest to update the software I had a sound problem onece you were making a hands fre call, but i could figure out how to solve. After I did the update from Firmware_KIW-L24_C567B130 To KIW-L24 C567B140. I started to have audio problems. Placing calls on hands free ( when in call and press the mic icon) the sound came in distorted. I went online and found no solution the only thing i did is downgrade to Firmware_KIW-L24_C567B130 and problem was solved. Once again I own two Honer 5X and I downgrade one and solved the problem. The other one that has the 140 version has the problem and the downgrade to 130 to fix. Hopes this helps. O and a side note i was using different carriers on the two phones at&amp;T and T-Mobile. So it is not carrier related.For the money its excellent. I did use google now launcher as the stock is kind of hard to get use to it. Camera is good with good light has some problems at night and pictures will come out with some grains, but its OK a phone should no be used to take quality pictures its excellent for social networking.Great to be used on At&amp;t and specially on T-mobile which i am using mine, my wife is on At&amp;t.Battery is excellent and holds up great.Can make calls with ether one sim card or the other it will show you when you are making a callUpdate.Another buyer asked if you could use tethering,You can use tethering with T-mobile network. I do it with no problems.",2016年4月3日 在美国审核
Great at first.. but now..,"So initially when I bought this phone in 2017, it was pretty good. Fit my needs, was large, screen was bright and vibrant, and I changed the UI to the nova home ui and then it was great. fingerprint scanner felt natural, albeit i accidentally unlocked it a few times putting into my pocket. Though at the time for $200whats not to love?Then the phone started to lag doing anything between loading apps, switching between screens, and even just locking the phone can take time.This is because the processor is a Snapdragon 616. To put this in perspective, the Galaxy s7 which costs around the same price uses a Snapdragon 820.The phone became practically a brick at times, where I had to shut the phone down on several times a day because I closed an app, then the phone froze. You can see why it's infuriating.A year later I traded the phone in for a new one, and it only granted a value of $20.. That left a sour taste, only getting a tenth of it's value.This clearly isn't a phone for me, but it might be for you if you're just starting out getting phones. I can recommend this to those who have never owned a smartphone (And in Alaska, it's not uncommon) but not for anyone who likes to multitask or game on phone.",2018年10月3日 在美国审核
Very nice for the price.,"Allow me to preface this review with saying that I just switched from a Windows device over to this Android out of necessity.That out of the way, I'm very pleasantly surprised with this phone. It works perfectly with my AT&amp;T prepaid service in Texas, and have not really found any flaws in service.The device itself is very nice. Solid build quality, clear phone calls, decent sound from the built in speaker and headphones when connected. I do have to point out one thing here though; the bluetooth connectivity on this phone leaves a lot to be desired. I have bluetooth in my truck to make and receive calls without having to even take the phone out of my pocket, but I noticed that this phone will drop the bluetooth connection randomly during calls (this was never an issue with the Windows phone. Not even once). It doesn't end the call, just loses connection to the radio, which is very confusing for everyone involved.The fingerprint scanner is AMAZING. It makes this phone very competitive with higher end, higher priced phones. When i showed my daughter that I can do more with the scanner than her iPhone can, she stopped talking to me until dinner. I call that a win...The camera is decent. When the lighting is ideal, it takes very nice pictures, but beware the low light environments. Even with the flash, low light pictures are very sub par. (Previous phone gets another nod for this. The low light pictures on that one were amazing...) However, since I don't really take too many pictures, it's not a deal breaker for me.All in all, this is a VERY nice phone that is able to hold its own against much more expensive and overrated models. I definitely recommend it, and even plan on getting one for my son once he finally figures out how to turn on the lawn mower....",2017年5月31日 在美国审核
Honor 5x...maybe i got lucky..,Updating::: I've had this phone for almost a full year it'll be a year in March 2018...I don't know about other reviewers and their problems with this phone but I can honestly say either I got lucky or something but I haven't had one problem and I use this phone almost none stop it's my go to instead of jumping on my laptop so this phone is a work horse I love this phone it can be a little slow but nothing that really is noticeable I play a lot of YouTube videos without any problems im texting my review update with this phone nowThis phone is amazing for the price.. I've had the phone for a little over a month and so far it's been working very well only time will tell ...But for the price you can't beat it..I don't play games on it so no input about gaming..But music and YouTube vids are great ..Sound is good for calls and video farly loud ..Maybe it could be better it seems to have only one speaker at the bottom of the phone close to where your charging port is on the right..I like the size of the screen but I'm thinking maybe next time I'll get a six inch.i like that they give you room at the bottom to hold your phone so your fingers aren't touching the home button..with my other phone I kept hitting that button no room...I love the look of the phone and of course the finger print scanner is great I found no lag with it or the phone it's self...So for the price and quality its a very nice phone...I can't see spending 700.00 dollars for a phone and then every year after buying another at the same price..this is only my opinion...So would I refer a friend to buy this honor 5x...YES!,2017年4月11日 在美国审核
I got this phone...,"...For my fiancé because his old one was dying. Couldn't wait to get it!When it arrived in my mailbox,I pulled it out of its brand new packaging and was delighted with how beautiful this phone was.I got the grey one for him, and was thinking about getting the silver one for myself, but after handling the grey one in person I've decided to get it for myself as well.The UI is different from stock Android--the phone runs on Android 5.1 and has a skin from Huawei, EMUI 3.0, which almost has an iOS flavor to it, as some people have probably noticed and commented.I am familiar with both operating systems (Android and Apple, though I prefer Android) and for me, this is kind of refreshing.It seems like a nice mix of both, though people who are die hard Android fans will probably not enjoy the new ground of the skinned over Android system in this phone.But really it's all up to personal experience.Will update this review soon.REVIEW UPDATE—DECEMBER 8, 2016:Had this phone for 9 months now, still love it! Bought the dark grey specifically because I didn't want to be distracted by the dark border around the egde of the display.Dropped this phone multiple time while in a wallet case, no screen or body damage, just a tiny dent but barely noticeable. Phone comes with screen protector, so didn't need to get that.Even after 9 months, the performance has not slowed.Only annoying thing is the thin aluminum strips around the volume and power buttons has become raised slightly, so I have to be somewhat careful not to get the power button stuck when turning the phone off or putting it to sleep.Contacted Huawei to see if this was covered under the warranty, and they claimed it is not because of the “normal wear and tear” of the phone.No matter.Still love it.Recently tried out an iPhone 6, and while the screen is sharper on the iPhone I still found myself coming back to this one.The screen size of 5.5 inches is perfect for me, so I found the iPhone's 4.7 to be a bit small.I also preferred this phone's 13MP camera to the iPhone's 8MP.The only thing I'll miss about the iPhone is iMessage and Podcast.Will keep using this phone until it dies a peaceful death.",2016年4月28日 在美国审核
"Pros: Inexpensive, Solidly Built Runs LineageOS with minimal hassle! -  Cons: Non-removable Battery and ???","This phone is is a great deal. It is solidly built has a good screen and once unlocked (simply get the unlock code from Huawei's Website) and flashed runs Lineage (CyanogenMod) OS like a champ.The fingerprint reader is in the perfect position and once you get used to the power button being below the volume up/down buttons (Samsung Phones have the power button above) the controls are intuitive and responsive.I broke my top of the line $680 3 month old LG that I bought from AT&amp;T and went back to my AT&amp;T Note 3 which I actually preferred over the LG. When that one finally gave up the ghost I still had 8 months left before my ""upgrade"" period.So the choices where:1. Pay out the LG and get and ""upgrade"" with a new 2 year contract2. Buy a new AT&amp;T phone for full retail3. Look for an Unlocked PhoneI chose #3 and do not regret this at all.Don't expect bleeding edge performance from this phone it is equivalent to a 2-3yo Top of the line phone. The boot loader can be easily unlocked and it has a great developer support community with tons of ROMs, themes etc including my favorite LineageOS (CyanogenMod's non-comercial fork)I would give it 5 starsfor value/price/performance but it does not have a removable battery, this seems to be the trend in Android phones; I hate it.Li-Ion batteries have a finite number of charge/discharge cycles and this usually equates to about 1.5-2 years worth of use. Once they start to fail their charge holding performance fails off a cliff.The reason i could run my old Note2 and Note 3 for almost 6 years combined total was that I could swap the batteries out when the old ones inevitably failed or if I forgot to charge it. I had 3 spare Hi-Cap Batteries so I always had a fresh fully charged spare. I miss this feature but for the low price of this phone I could theoretically just buy a second one and swap the SIM card back and forth. As of now battery life is about 1 day with a fresh charge. So I will live with it for now.",2017年7月13日 在美国审核
Best $200 phone you have ever owned!!,"This is definitely a quality phone with solid performance and flagship spec hardware. I have had all the flagship phones, I usually buy unlocked phones since I use Straight Talk as my provider because I hate the carrier gimmicks. So when I spent $200 for the 5X versus my LG G4 International version that was $400. Or LG V10 was $500.I didn't expect to be blown away for the price. WOW I WAS WRONG! Huawei makes awesome phones its just no one knows the brand because Samsung, LG &amp; Apple dominate the US market.Pros:*Battery lasts all day and charges 100% in less than 90 minutes.*UNLOCKED LTE my fastest speed test was 89 Mbps on cellular network and with Dual sim trays you can easily configure it for 2 lines or one sim for data &amp; 1 sim for calls. Even 2 carriers at onceAt&amp;T and the other T mobile.(Sweet)*Build is Solid aluminum and quality buttons and one of the fastest fingerprint sensor of any phone.*Screen being only 1080P is bright with good color reproduction and comes with a screen protector already applied.*Octa- Coremakes it very snappy and I could not get it to shudder once with only 2gb ram is impressive performance.*EMUI I heard many tech reviewers complaining about it and the app tray issue. I installed google launcher it takes 5 seconds to fix and I have to say Ilove the Emui its packed with so many useful features that are all disabled so its not bloatware using up ram.*Best phone Audio I have ever heard. I tried with all my sets and WOW blown away.

Best phone for $150-$200,"There is a lot of garbage out there being talked about this phone.As soon as it arrived I tested it thoroughly and it did not lag while doing anything, including playing Pokemon GO which is VERY resource intensive. It works even better after the update to Android 6.0.The fingerprint sensor works flawlessly and is incredible nice. I thought it would be weird having it on the back of the phone but am pleasantly surprised.I also did not expect it to feel quite as sturdy as it does. The powerbutton, volume, etc, feel much more sturdy than any of the Galaxy S's that I have owned (Galaxy 2-5.)I have been playing a lot of Pokemon GO with the phone and it performs MUCH better than the Galaxy S5. Zero lag, haven't had it freeze except for once so far over a week. The GPS isn't QUITE as accurate as with GLONASS but it's barely noticeable.Overall I'm extremely pleased with this phone. I couldn't ask for much more except maybe 1GB more RAM for future android releases. However, I doubt it will be neccessary to upgrade for at least 2-3 years.Also it should be noted that if you plan to unlock the bootloader and install Cyanogenmod or another custom ROM you should know that you cannot use the HDR photo mode, which works incredibly well with this phone. The pictures are stunning. Shutter is super-fast. And this is the reason I did not upgrade to Cyanogenmod.If you do want to upgrade to Cyanogenmod, you should know that you will have to pay an extra $5 to get the bootloader unlock code as you cannot get the code through the main EMUI website as you could before. The site has been removed. However you can use an app called ""DC Unlocker"" to get the code to unlock the booatloader. But it will void the warranty (of course,) and like I said earlier, it costs $5...The performance with Cyanogenmod I am sure would be outstanding, however the regular EMUI/ANDROID 6.0 that comes loaded on the phone, is perfectly fine.I HIGHLY recommend you install Nova Launcher or another launcher however as it will speed the phone up a good bit from the stock launcher.The phone has 1GB ram free when you install Nova Launcher and have no other apps running.ALSO I can confirm that 4G LTE works in the USA with ATT.",2016年9月3日 在美国审核
Best phone at this price,"I bought this for tech illiterate father. His current phone is one of those free LG android phones that Tmobile tricks old people to buy in order to make quick cash. Anyway, I researched my options and settled on the Honor 5X for its price and my father's ability to use a phone. I set it up for him, and I am actually quite impressed with it all.The phone itself does not feel cheap, at all. The metal unibody construction arguably feels feel than my Pixel, and I love my Pixel to death. EMUI is a software that mimics iOS more than anything, but its simple and easy to learn. The screen is bright and looks amazing compared to phones at this price range. The finger print sensor is on point as well, even though it'll probably take sometime before my old man figures that one out. Camera works great, too, much better than the crappy LG phone he had, which was partly why I wanted him to upgrade. Again, it all looks awesome on the big screen.Honestly if you are considering between this phone and the Moto G4, I would stick with the Honor 5X. My friend has that one and its a little slow for me, whereas the 5X doesn't seem to lag in the home screen at all. You don't know the brand as well, but Huawei has really been killing it lately and I would give this one a chance. It's not a flagship, though, so don't expect it to act like one. Go for the OnePlus 3T if you're looking for one. If you don't really care about max specs, though, and want a beautiful looking phone with a big screen, decent camera, and low price, you found it.",2016年12月27日 在美国审核
All the phone I need.,"If your not a techno nut and don't have to have all the best of everything then this phone is worth it. I have only had it for 2 wks. now but I love the fit and feel and function. Can't wait for the Android update, the fingerprint function is great and being able to take pictures or use the flashlight without having to unlock the phone is nice. I'm coming off a Tracfone galaxy centura so just being able to get 4G service is a big deal for me. Dual sim and the ability to have an SD card all at the same time.is also great. It means I can have 2 numbers if I wanted or if I go out of country. I don't live on my phone so I don't care if it takes 1-2 seconds longer to get on the internet because my processor doesn't have the power of a nuclear power plant. I have had no problem watching movies or listening to streaming music, even on a poor Wi-Fi connection. In my book it's a lot of phone for $200",2016年3月8日 在美国审核
Upgrading on a Budget...,"I'm a bit behind the times, as I upgraded from a Samsung S3. I realize that I'm coming up from a phone that was over 5 years old, but I got to say, I'm really liking this phone. My S3 suddenly died one day, and I was unable to revive it. I was in a budget crunch, so my max was $200. After some research of phones in my budget, this Honor 5X seemed to be at the top of everyone's list. I took a chance, and after having the phone for about 2 weeks, I'm very impressed. The screen is very clear and sharp, and it's easy to navigate. It's taken a bit getting used to a larger phone, but it's also a larger screen, which is nice. I also bought a case and a screen protector for it, as I want it to last as long as possible. I would recommend making sure you have a newer micro SD card, as I have an older 16 GB card full of music, and it seems to take about 10 seconds to pull up my library. Reviews seem to indicate that a newer class 10 SD card would solve the delay problem, so I just ordered a 64 GB card from Amazon. Some reviews also mentioned the battery not lasting, but I haven't had that problem. After using it more than normal, the lowest I've seen the battery was at 37% at around 10pm. Anyway, now my wife wants one of these phones too. For under $200 you really can't go wrong. I'm sure it's no Galaxy S7, but it also wasn't $650. I say go for this phone, you won't be disappointed.UPDATE: 5 MONTHS LATERI've had this phone about 5 months now, and I'm still very satisfied.The phone works great, and I've had absolutely no problems at all.I've even had Samsung owners check out my phone and tell me in confidence that next time they're getting one of these, as they couldn't justify spending an extra $400.This phone pretty much does everything theirs does. I just bought my wife the Honor 6X on Prime Day, and I'm eager to see how hers works.Again, totally worth it.UPDATE: 18 MONTHS LATERI've had this phone 18 months now, and I still have not had a single problem with it.Sometimes with lots of apps running, the battery gets into the teens around 9pm, but you could easily make it last longer by closing out apps you're not using.Still highly recommend.UPDATE: 2 YRS 9 MONTHS LATERA great phone.Although I just upgraded to a Samsung A50 for under $250, this 5X is still a great phone.I upgraded because I have a Chromebook, and for some reason the Honor 5X is not recognized by my Chromebook.Since I'm doing more on my Chromebook, I really need to be able to transfer files between the two devices.I'm going to order a cool case and a new screen protector and give it to my son for his first started phone.I still highly recommend this phone, although unless they've been upgrading the features, it's probably out of date compared to what's out there now.",2017年2月20日 在美国审核
Great phone for the average user - Review for Android Marshmallow 6.0.1,"This review is for the OTA Marshmallow Version. There is such a performance difference from Lollipop to Marshmallow that it make it like a completely different phone in terms of speed and experience. Another setting I changed was the battery setting from Smart --&gt; Ultra. Battery life may suffer by 1 hour, but the lag will be gone.First glance, it feels like a premium phone. It seems that the goal of Huawei for this phone is to make it feel like iPhone, and you can tell this by the UI that it has integrated on top of stock Android. However, I'm more of a fan of the stock Android experience. I'll list out a couple of the features and my thoughts below at this price point.Screen - Comes with a screen protector applied. Good color and resolution.Sound - Downward facing speakers are LOUD. Wished it had a wider range of volume from softer to loud. Because of this, sound may lack crisp clarity.Camera - Fast focus and shutter. Lots of features built in. A bit more noise than I like, but still decent performer at this price point.Stock Launcher - Not a big fan, truly mimics Apple's design. I gave up on this and installed Google Now Launcher.Stock Apps - A bit too much bloatware, but that may be due subsidy? These are removable. I suggest avoiding Huawei's stock apps and getting Google's version of the app.Navigation - On screen buttons and notification tray/quick launch are nice and customizable in the settings menu. Recent apps button shows memory usage and a clear all button to free up RAM/memory. Fast app switching.Customization - The important ones I can think of are included. Wished the settings of these were more organized.Performance - Youtube plays fine at 1080. Stutter is still visible, but does not hinder experience. Good for day to day use.Charging - No fast charge technology. At 50% battery &amp; screen off, charges only at max 1.3A using Samsung's 2A charger. Stock charger is rated 1A max. Small room for charger upgrade.To sum up, this is a great phone for the price. I would definitely recommend for people who don't do gaming or any processor intensive task. Amazing value for people who uses group chats, checks emails or browse the web on the phone. One thing to keep in mind is that don't expect perfection at this price point. However, I feel that you're getting more than what you pay for. (Please thumbs up if helpful)",2016年7月16日 在美国审核
Great ideas poor execution.,"I have had quite the bad experience with this phone and Honor support. I am going to keep it quick.Why I got this phone. Android 6.0, under $200, a fingerprint reader, a big screen.Screen is very bright but very scratch prone.Finger print reader is good for a $200 smartphoneCamera is okBattery life is strong. A full day with moderate use and playing games.The touch sensitivity is much better then the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3. Good for rhythm games.Speaker is decent for bottom firingI had to RMA the phone for multiple reasons.1. A bubble formed under my screen. I've had many phones in the past and none has done this before.2. It was super scratched up from normal use and a few drops. I had a case onit too.3. Its super slow. I had to switch to the google now launcher. While using it on my 8hr drive to Boston for the NA LCS finals the phone restarted on me.Also after RMAing the phone it does not want to update to Android 6.0+ Using the EMUI updater and it just says its up to date. I've tried loading the update from their website to no avail.Honor support is super slow on responding to emails. The first guy I called didn't know how to properly factory reset my honor 5x. He told me to hold the power button and volume down. When its power button and volume button up.I am going to contact Amazon and see if I can get a refund. I am done with this phone. Its honestly worse then my Alcatel One Touch Idol 3.*UPDATE*I got in contact with Honor support Twitter again and they were much more helpful. I got it updated to Android 6.0. They added a bunch of pre-installed apps with the update which is a no go for me. You have to go into the app file info to remove it.The performance is much quicker. I am not sure what they did but it is a bit snappier then before. This phone is ok at best. I highly suggest getting a screen protector. [2-Pack] Supershieldz for Huawei Honor 5X.

Great phone for the price!,"So far so good, I am really liking this phone. My previous phone was a Nexus 4 and this phone is definitely a step up for me, but at about the same price point (I paid around 200 for my Nexus during the special promo they ran).It does lag a little at time when loading but it's not a big deal. It's a big larger than my previous phone but it's light and still small enough to slide in my back pocket.I like the fingerprint unlock, it's very responsive and it offers pin unlock as well. Most of the commonly used apps were already loaded, there were only a couple I found missing and was able to install and run them with no issues.It has a nice polished metal case that I like.There are a few stock apps that are kind of ""eh"" but I just either uninstalled them or disabled them in one form or another and replaced them with the ones I like better. The screen is a nice, crisp, clean looking screen and the only complaint I have with the UI is that the only way to organize your apps is manually (They are not in any specific order except maybe most recent are added at the end; I would prefer alphabetical). I am using this phone on StraightTalk/ATT sim setup and it was very easy to install the sim and set it up.",2016年8月31日 在美国审核
"Not a Galaxy s7, but then again, it's $200","Great phone for the price. I'd Like To Give It 4.5 stars, but will rate up because of the price. It's not a perfect phone, and this review may sound more negative than a 5 star rating. But if you are going to buy the phone, you should understand the limitations that come with the price. And knowing what I do now, I'd still buy it.I didn't want to review the phone until I used it for a while, and since I've had it a few months, it's time. After reading some reviews here I installed the Google Now Launcher over the Huawei EMUI. That's gone pretty well, but twice it reverted back to the Huawei Home Launcher. It is easy enough to fix, but I forgot how, so each time it took about a half hour to figure out. Answering the phone is also a bit tricky. The icons are not intuitive, and as a result I've missed many calls. Just when I thought I understood it, the icons changed again.Anyhow, there's much to like about the Honor 5X. The fingerprint reader is sweet, although if my hands are a little wet (touching a water glass) it doesn't read right away. And when you reboot, you need to enter your PIN. I'm not sure I understand that logic but it's not a big deal. I like the size of the phone, and it feels solid.The home, back and open apps buttons are part of the screen. In my last phone it was below the screen, and I think I like that better. With one game, I can't access those buttons because the game is using the entire screen.The camera is good, not great, and better with daylight than indoor light.People here like the battery life but I haven't found it to be that good. Over the weekend I went to Washington DC with a fully charged phone. In 5 hours I sent a few text messages, took about 8 photos, posted to Facebook 7 times, did about 6 web searches and used the map twice, each time for about a minute. Total time using the phone maybe 20 minutes. And that took me down to 78%.Not perfect. But for the price, it's very good.",2016年5月10日 在美国审核
A Very Good Phone that Offers a Spectacular Value,"This device replaced a Motorola Moto G as my phone, and overall I am very pleased with it. The design offers a lot of hits and a few misses, but is, overall, and outstanding package for the price.Hardware-wise, talking about value really sells this device short. It's quite a bit nicer than many ""premium"" products on the market. The overall impression when handling the device is of quality. The screen is bright and crisp and the body nicely-machined from metal. The battery life is outstanding. The fingerprint sensor works well and is a joy to have, certainly one of the highlights of this phone. The camera is quite good and the speakers surprisingly decent. The SD card slot is magnificent, I don't know how I got by with a phone that lacked this feature. Overall, there is very little not to like about this device physically, except for possibly the size. On this front your milage will vary with your tastes. I have never owned a phone this large, and I find it a little too big. I had expected to get accustomed to carrying it, but I still find it cumbersome to pocket. This is, of course, a personal preference.The hardware column is full of ""hits,"" and the software is where you find more of the ""misses."" The phone comes pre-loaded with quite a lot of stuff. Some of it is Huawei's own software suite, their versions of everyday utility applications like a mail client, an address book, a clock, a calendar, and so forth. Some of it is fairly common applications that they took the liberty of assuming you will need, e.g. Twitter. Or perhaps they got paid to preload on the phone. Either way, there is a good bit of bloat, but it is simple enough to delete. The Huawei applications cannot be deleted, though you could certainly opt not to use them and replace them with an app of your liking. I gave them all a shake. The interface designs on all of them are quite good, in fact quite a bit better than most of the Google applications. They are attractive and offer generally well thought out interfaces. But the design sense don't quite carry all the way through. Take the clock application: I opened it and was pleasantly surprised to see a remarkably attractive layout, great color choices, and an Apple-style swipe-up swipe-down ""cylinder"" number wheel for setting times. Awesome! But then I clicked ""go"" on the stopwatch to time a presentation I was practicing, and it makes an obnoxious little ""tickticktick"" sound. Can't find any way to turn it off. Later I set the alarm clock, and wake up to the comically cheesy sound of a guy singing to me. At least I woke up laughing, albeit in disbelief at how cheesy a default ringtone they gave the alarm. Or consider the contacts application: I opened it, and thought, ""hey, this looks great."" And then my next thought: ""who are all of these people?"" Yeah, it mades a contact for everyone I have ever corresponded with, ever. So glad to be back in touch with you, job-582828282@craigslist.org. Can't figure out how to run this off, though I'm sure there is a solution somewhere on the web. So overall, it is very odd. It seems impossible that the visual choices are so keen, and then other design choices in the very same app are so off. This detracts from an otherwise very appealing package, but of course, this being Android, it is easy enough to change the experience to your liking. It just takes time and effort.Overall, if the size is what you are after and you don't mind spending some time customizing your experience, this phone offers an outstanding choice at a remarkably reasonable price. I wish Amazon allowed for half-stars, because though this is not quite a five-star product to me, it is very very close.",2016年9月16日 在美国审核
at first it worked great. It was sleek,"So, I bought the phone in June, at first it worked great. It was sleek, user friendly and very snappy(apps loaded quickly). I bought it because it was a well recommended budget phone to replace my HTC M8. A little over a month later, issues started showing up more frequently. In the beginning the phone would freeze after starting up an app. I thought that was just a little glitch so I didn't think too much about it because the phone would fix itself and everything would carry on normally. Then the freezing started to occur more frequently and to the point that I had to do a force restart to fix the problem. After having the phone for only 2 months, these glitches have become nearly unbearable. So now, the freezing happens less frequently but, the phone started to reset itself at least twice a day. During these self-resets, sometimes it would set the phone into default settings, forcing me to have to change the system customization back to what I set them to, but that issue isn't too bad.The only reason why I still put up with these complications is because this phone is my only way to call anybody when I am not at home. Overall, I would not recommend this product. Despite buying it brand new these problems appeared just 1 month after using it! My first impressions of this company were pretty optimistic. But after a little bit of time, it left a very poor impression. 2/5 stars. Would not recommend.",2017年8月15日 在美国审核
Surprisingly good phone for the price,"UPDATE 6/23/19This phone had served me well for about a year before it started to slow down. No matter how much I delete and keep it optimized and whatnot it takes 30 second or so some times to get off a blank screen while switching around through apps or surfing the internet. Now the battery has started to bloat over the past few months. I hadn't noticed it right away. My screen cracked first and I thought it was from my own carelessness. But when the cover wouldn't sit correctly on the device a couple months later, I finally noticed my phone pulling apart at the seams from the battery expanding within. I can't even remove the battery without buying a special screwdriver to take the metal cover off. So I'm now in the process of moving files via bluetooth so I can discard the phone without blowing up the battery using a charge cable. It was fun while it lasted. Now it's just dangerous.ORIGINAL REVIEW:11/6/16I wanted to graduate from the outdated smart phones on Tracfones website without losing the service. I grew tired of trying to surf the internet on tiny screens with super slow processors while my friends zip through data on their Samsungs watching videos and searching up info within seconds while I'm still sitting at the loading screen waiting for the internet app to pop up.This phone turned out to be a far superior upgrade. I'm not the type to ""live"" on my phone (mainly due to owning cruddy phones all my life) but I found it to be super sufficient to handle my basic and more advanced needs. It handles multi-tasking and video watching really well. Having a larger screen makes typing and reading SO much easier. I could transfer my contacts over from my cheap tracfone really easily and I got to keep my phone number. The expandable memory card is probably the best thing ever. I really like the fingerprint lock feature which makes turning it on quick and painless. It has smart Wifi, which means it will opt to run on an any open/free wifi network before using your data. If you want to use data, you simply turn off your wifi connector to use 4G if it's available.The one thing I was worried about the most was battery life, but it turned out to sufficient overall. Like I said, I don't ""live"" on my phone (not yet anyway) but it lasts me well into the next day. I haven't ever run out of battery, even if I take it off the charger all night to look at stuff before I go to bed. It barely loses a few percentage by morning, if any. It also has a battery saving feature that will recommend certain actions to extend the life of your device throughout the day such as unused apps or functions.The only negative thing I have to say about it is the camera. If it weren't for the price difference, I would've gone with the Nexus 5X simply for the quality photos. The Honor 5X is really lacking when it comes to photographs and video. Photos are not sharp, especially around lights, and it's really difficult to focus on distant targets. I took it to a concert for a test drive and was not happy with the results. Especially when I noticed people sitting near me taking clearer photos at the same distance with the same lighting. Other than that, I think it's a great upgrade for prepaid users looking to get out of the second hand realm of outdated android phones.",2016年11月7日 在美国审核
Phantastic Phone!  Works on GoSmart.  Attracts LEGO people,"If you don't want to spend a fortune but aren't willing to sacrifice and buy a bargain phone, all the essential specs are here.Two weeks daily use observations:---The battery life is unbelievable.Super-fantastic and phenomenal even.Really, it's just unreal.I can go 2-3 days between charges with normal usage.I've had it on for 32 hours now and it's at 63%.---I really like the power management in this phone.The phone doesn't want anything sucking up juice in the background and it lets you know what's happening right in the pull down notifications.It says ""Hey knucklehead, you left Angry Birds running in the background"" (kill button).It's actually nicer than that.It doesn't call you names but it does constantly make you aware of things you may want to turn off.I love that.---The included one-touch tool for cleaning your useless data from the phone internal memory and SD card is also quite nice.---The GPS response is really fast.I have other devices that take as long as a minute or more to lock on, I have some that are pretty quick (a second or two).The Honor is as fast or faster than anything I've used.The accuracy seem pretty solid too.---Set up the fingerprint scanner.It's awesome!(I didn't for over a week)Opening up specific apps with a certain finger from sleep mode is actually a useful feature that I may have a hard time going without in the future.I have to keep the phone locked to use this feature (I wish that were optional) but I use code 0000 (simple) and both index fingerprints open it in under a second.One finger opens music, another, my fav GPS app, etc.---I like the included FM receiver.You need to plug in earbuds or a 3.5mm cord as an antennae and the reception is really good.What's also nice is you can swap between listening with the earbuds or using the external speaker.---The more I play with it, the more I like the EMUI interface.I refused to add a ""more android"" loader (yet?) as I wanted to give the vanilla interface a real test first.Having no app drawer doesn't really bother me (who knew?).---So far I am liking this camera.It focuses very well and pictures have been coming out quite nice.I've seen others do better in low lighting but overall, it's a good camera.The perfect selfie makes me look 20 years younger if set to ""10"".---The screen is really vibrant.It has whites that are actually white and fairly deep blacks.---On a more Android related note, I hear that there's already a working TWRP for this phone and they are working on a version of Cyanogenmod for it.(My favorite rom)---I took off the included plastic screen protector immediately (hate those ugly, peeling things) and added a tempered glass screen.Tempered glass feels great on here, possibly more responsive!(?)FYI - I hooked mine up to the $30/month, 4GB data, GoSmart Mobile plan in Seattle area.Data seems fine to me but I don't use a huge amount.Cons:---Not Gorilla Glass (will always need a protector or micro scratches will develop quickly)---Lack of cases available (only a handful of styles when I purchased).It's new, and I suspect more cases will come if we keep buying this phone.---It isn't playing well with my smartwatch (Moto 360, 1st Gen).I can't seem to get weather pushed onto it and some other annoyances (worked perfect with my Galaxy S3).Will keep trying.I'll find a different watch before I dump this phone.:-D---I don't personally like the placement of the power button below the volume.It's too low and feels awkward to reach with an index finger (the finger Samsung has trained me to use).The fingerprint unlock circumvents this particular annoyance.There's very few phones that match what this is at this price point.The Asus Zen Phone 2 is nice too at a similar price, but the little extras here were hard to pass up.I'd buy this again without hesitation.Pic L--&gt;R: Galaxy Tab 3, Honor 5X, Galaxy S3, HTC Evo 3D, unpaid LEGO models.",2016年2月28日 在美国审核
"Almost business class experience for the price of an economy class. Well, the cabin crew may take their time once in a while","I placed an order of the pre-released 5x to replace a 3+ years old LG Optimus F3. After using the 5x for 3 weeks, I am astound that I have all these nice smart phone features and build quality at my finger tips, for exactly the same price I paid for the LG F3. There are many positive reviews on the build quality, price/performance and hardware already, and I concur in general with those reviews;I no longer run out of space and having to tolerate a low resolution screen. The 5x' hardware is great, but there are a few rough edges on the usages. Here are a few I found combersome that prevent me from giving 5 stars: 1) take 4 touches to enable/disable mobile data (i.e. Setting-&gt; More -&gt; Mobile Netwwork -&gt;On/Off); the UI try to compensate this inconvenience via a Short Cut, yet the drop down menu is shared between the Short Cut and Notification. 2) Finger print works great, and finger print management allows only a maximum of 5 prints. 3) The orientation of the return pointer (that triangular pointer) is inconsistent; sometimes points to the left, sometimes to the up. 4) Coming from the F3, I love the camera's panorama shot. Wait, changing the scan direction (left-to-right vs right-to-left, and N-to-S vs S-to-N) is not intuitively obvious as in my daughter's Samsung S6. For the 5x, one has to physically rotate the phone 180 degree to switch the direction. Weird? Well, for its price and features, I will live with these annoyances.",2016年2月20日 在美国审核
Amazing phone for the price,"I ordered this smartphone for its dual sim card slots and expandable memory. I have a large library of music, and being able to keep it on an SD card and not take up the phone's internal memory is a huge deal breaker for me. I have never had any Huawei products before this phone, but I will definitely be buying from them again in the future.Before this phone, I was using a ZTE Grand X Max +. Going from that phone to this one, there was a noticeable difference in responsiveness. I no longer had a 1-2 second lag when typing up text messages, and I could run more apps simultaneously. Another huge difference between the two phones is build quality. The honor 5x feels very well built and the placement of the buttons works well in my hands. It seems a shame to put a case on this phone, but I am too paranoid not to.The case I am using with this phone is The DWay Armor Case Honor 5x:",2016年7月21日 在美国审核
By Far... Best Phone In This Price Space,"**Edited 12 June 2017 to add:I have owned this phone for almost one full year. I would write the review shown below today: unchanged. It really is a great phone!You would be hard-pressed to find a better phone at this price.The screen is crisp, clear(*) and responsive. Though sometimes maligned in the blogosphere, the Huawei version of the Lollipop O/S (or 'skin') provides more advantages than annoyances. I found the options within the O/S to be better than my last phone in this price space (BLU Life One purchased last year).***Edit to add: Marshmallow (Android M 6.0.1) is available for this phone. Spooling out to phone over air and also available for immediate download to SD card... [...] for details!My only disappointment is that the WiFi Hotspot feature will not work for Cricket customers. Unlike some phones, the Honor 5X will ping the carrier for permission before drawing data for the Hotspot. I had two previous phones that did not do this and Cricket was none-the-wiser (I use the option infrequently and never exceed my data cap).*Get a glass screen protector the day you buy this phone! (I bought a 9H glass protector from Supersheildz and love it).*The OEM screen protector is crap. It is plastic, inhibits your gestures across the face of the screen, and loves to collect the oils from your skin.",2016年7月15日 在美国审核
SURPRISED BY SOLID BUILD &amp; HIGH QUALITY,"After hours (days, really) of researching and pondering the quality and reliability of all types of low-cost android phones for T-Mobile, I decided to take a chance on this extremely well-reviewed Huawei Honor 5X, and I must say that, like so many other consumers, I was genuinely surprised to have received such a solidly built smartphone that continues to exceed expectations. It's beautiful. In fact, we have now bought a second one for our son (who previously owned an expensive Samsung) and he says there is actually not a bit of noticeable difference between the two phones to warrant a single mention -- except, of course, the tremendous, almost laughable difference in price. Just goes to show the rest of us how greed can play such an infuriating role in the marketing of $800-$900 smartphones by those more well-known corporations whose overpriced products really can be well-built while sold for only a couple of hundred bucks after all. Someone over at the Huawei company was on the ball -- and smart enough to have potentially turned the tables on the competition big-time, because this company is going to sell an awful lot of these great phones. The phones are very sturdy, attractive, can do exactly what any very expensive smartphone can do, and this family -- who has finally become tired of paying nearly a $grand$ for brand name smartphones -- is delighted to have found such an affordable and dependable product.",2017年2月23日 在美国审核
Great phone,"I'm coming to this phone from S6. The S6 is nice and but the battery life is horrible and I wanted to try a bigger screen.I didn't care for the stock ui but I didn't thinknit was horrible. Just different. Its an attractive design I just prefer a more standard android experience. That said I put CM13 on it. I love this phone. The screen is fantastic. It runs CM13 plenty fast. I don't really notice any stuttering. The physical design of the phone is beautiful and modern. The battery life is fantastic. I use my phone a lot during the day and can easily finish with 50 percent.The only real negative is the camera. Its fine in good light but the low light pictures are meh.Overall this is a fantastic deal. I've used moto g's and other budget phones and this one is significantly better. I think for normal use it is perfectly serviceable. Can't really speak for games or any resource intensive apps but I understand most app designers write for average hardware. Shouldn't be an issue. Also, it doesn't look or feel like a budget phone.Love this phone. You could buy this phone and a warehouse deal DSLR and still spend less money than many of the flagships. Would not hesitate to recomend and I'm looking forward to trying other Huawei products.",2016年11月8日 在美国审核
Best $200 phone,"So I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks and I am impressed! For 200 bucks you get a lot out of your purchase. I love the finger print scanner at the back of the phone ; makes unlocking the phone quick and easy. The phone itself is pretty snappy when accessing apps. Although some apps open slower, probably due to compatibility issues with the OS. The phone currently runs on lollipop which kinda blows. Still waiting on Huawei to release marshmallow on this phone.It is also worth noting that I upgraded from the Nexus 5 due to the following reasons. The Nexus 5, although great, had horrendous battery life and had very limited storage. The honor 5x on the other hand has amazing Battery life and has expandable storage.Nexus 5 vs The honor 5xIn my honest opinion, I believe the honor 5x is a good upgrade from the Nexus 5 ; especially if you want something not so expensive.ProsCheapFinger print scannerSnappySelfie camera is greatLong Battery lifeExpandable storageConsThe software for the back camera sucks despite being 13MPOS updates takes awhile to releaseCertain apps don't work properly, like recording videos with Snapchat lags.UPDATE : The phone is actually pretty horrible after half a year of use.

Good so far - really nice,"Feels like good quality.Why are other phones so expensive?This one came with a lot fewer of the stupid built in apps that I never used.The Huawei UI seems OK....works fine.Camara very nice...has good editing features and the multi focus option is nice if you are like me and always edit photos like you should anyway.People don't understand that most all cameras only caputure ""averaged"" photos and that it is up to the user to bring them to life and emphasize the favoed qualities with editing software before showing them anyway.I like this phone so far and my only complaint so far is it seems to be longer/taller than it should be.Too much space on each end of the screen.I don't know why all these manufacturers insist on making them look like iphones on the front.The back is great.Update - I have had this phone for about a week and I am very impressed.I am also very impressed by the way the Huawei folks respond to these comments.Taking the time to do that shows a lot of class and professionalism - nice to know someone reads these things.Only one thing I can't figure out and that is how to hear directions in Google Maps.For some reason I can't find the setting and I don't know if it the software or the phone.Probably not the phone's fault.",2016年4月21日 在美国审核
Great Value for the Money.  Fingerprint Reader is not a Luxury any more,"I got an iPhone 6 from work.And my ancient Nokia Winders phone was rather pale in comparison.But I am a cheapskate.This phone is perfect for me (except that it doesn't have NFC, but I'm willing to live without it for the price.)Now that I have used a fingerprint reader it is a requirement for any future phone.The fingerprint reader on this phone is positioned on the back, about a third of the way from the top.This makes it easy to use index, middle, and ring fingers of either hand for short cuts.The only thing I don't like:The power button takes very little pressure, and is positioned so that my left fingers shut off the phone when I cradle it in my hand.NOTE:The phone comes with a plastic screen protector pre-installed.I was disappointed by the smudginess.Then I pulled one of those dumb ""balance it on the dashboard and take a hard left"" maneuvers.When I fished it out from under the seat it had a divot in the screen.I ordered a tempered glass cover.While preparing to install the cover, I found out about the pre-installed plastic protector.If you aren't careless with your phone, you might find that it smudges less without the plastic protector.If you are like me, you need at least one tempered glass protector.You'll be happier with a glass protector in place of the pre-installed one.One nice thing:Most of the divot was in the pre-installed protector, so it did its job well.",2016年10月25日 在美国审核

Great phone,"Awesome phone for its price. I purchased a used one with a phinicy charging port, but everything else was awesome. After 2 weeks of using the Honor 5x I would like to write this review for Huawei. The 5X was not my first choice, I was looking at the 6X but I could not afford it at the time. I do have a few complaints about the phone, mainly the charging port requires some love to get a good connection, but after you get it in correctly, the phone will be charged in between 1 hour and 30 minutes.

However, I am a 5'9'' tall male I must say at first the phone was a bit large for my front pocket, but I got used to it. Now I don't even notice it is there.The battery life is insane! I think this phone would last on stand by for a month or more. I can use it heavily and still not have to charge it but every other day or so. I want to mention that the cord that comes with the Honor 5x for charging is a bit short for my taste.The camera is what you would expect from a 199.00 phone. It is good, but it will not blow you out of the water.The reception for calls is fantastic. Unlike my last phone, a Samsung Galaxy something, all my calls come in crystal clear, stay crystal clear, and don't drop.The software that the phone comes with is decent. Although, I think they force update some Amazon apps on to it now. That being said, I did switch over the much more customizable Nova launcher, and I haven't looked back.Some of the other features I like are: that bluetooth syncs up really well in my car for hands free calling, the finger print scanner is still going strong and is very responsive, the large screen for watching Netflix or Youtube, and the screen quick draw options for things like the camera or the flashlight to turn on. The quick flashlight access has saved me a stubbed toe on many occasions!Anyway, this is a good phone for the price, the features, and for the ability to customize with Android launchers.

I installed Nova Launcher after I got the phone (I recommend that too)-There were times where I felt the keyboard was not responsive, however, I do not know if it was my fingers or the phone-Mimicking the iPhone style (Many people thought I had an iPhone Plus)The pros definitely outweighs the cons dramatically, especially for the price. This phone could easily be charged much higher but is less than 200$. Is this the best phone on the market? Of course not, but it easily beats other 200$ phones maybe even 300$ phones or higher on the market. Get this phone if you are on a budget. I still use this phone and I plan to use this phone for a couple more years, or at least until I graduate college. Good job Honor 5X, my wallet and I thank you.",2016年11月9日 在美国审核
the lagging issue became very bad. It got a point that the phone freezes ...,"I have owned this phone for close to 5 months,and I regret purchasing it.My goal was to get an unlocked phone with mid range specs that almost rival other flagship or semi flagship devices on the market for a fraction of the premium price.However,I think I got exactly what I paid for.A POS phone.Within the first few weeks of having with phone,it performed satisfactorily with a few lags here and there.As weeks progressed into months,the lagging issue became very bad.It got a point that the phone freezes for almost 15 minutes,and I would have to restart it.The stock Android UI had a lot of bugs,and I thought after a few pushed updates from the manufacturer that it will be fixed. As I write this,the phone runs an android version 6.0.1, and stillthe issue has severely gotten worse,that I am in the process of purchasing another phone.Other than the fact that this phone kills my productivity speed,I think it has a very responsive finger screen scanner which seems to be the only reason iam giving it one star.My advice is to not purchase this phone if you are the high speed professional that is looking to be productive at work.2G of RAM doesn't cut it.For the price,it will be good for a backup phone.It is also good for kids and maybe as a gift.I may just have to purchase a new phone and keep this as a back up since it has no warranty and my amazon's warranty has past 😕👎",2017年5月30日 在美国审核

Was great but right now you should wait and buy the ZTE Zmax Pro for half the price and slightly better specs!,"Back when I bought it (May 2016) this was by far the best bang for the buck smartphone/phablet on Amazon US.Pros:- 5,5"" and FullHD (401ppi) IPS screen looks amazing! (iPhone 6s- Snapdragon 616 + 2GB ram is as snappy as you can get for an under 200 bucks smartphone- 13 MP, f/2.0 camera takes amazing photos (better than iPhone 6s quality: 12 MP, f/2.2)- 5 MP, f/2.4 (slightly less than the iPhone 6s camera: 5 MP, f/2.2)- fingerprint scanner- 16GB + up to 256GB microSD is more than enough storage- Stereo SpeakersCons:- Huawei's UI looks nothing like Android and similar to iOS (and sucks a lot). Though you can easily get onto Google Play Store and install Google Now Launcher and have a normal Android UI =)All and all it is a great device but right now I cannot recommend it since in just a few weeks ZTE Zmax Pro is launching which has almost the same specs (most of them a lil' better, for example CPU) and it's going to be half price at only 99 u$s.",2016年7月26日 在美国审核
I was looking for the best $200 smartphone,"I was looking for the best $200 smartphone, and narrowed the choices down to OnePlus X and the 5X. I was leaning toward the 5X because of the larger screen, but I was concerned about the EMUI interface because I had read so much negative commentary about how awful it was, how it slowed down the system and how it wasn't ""pure Android"". Coming from a Nexus phone, I was happy with the stock Android experience. But after doing a few simple changes, I find that it's not a problem.First, I installed the free Nova Launcher, which gave me a pretty stock Android look and feel. To minimize the effect of EMUI on storage, I either removed or disabled all the apps I didn't want, or moved them to the SD card where possible (some apps that need faster memory don't allow this). I also set the SD card as the default storage so that pictures/videos and any apps that allow it would be automatically downloaded to the SD card.After moving all my apps from the Nexus, I wound up with 7GB free space on the internal memory, which should be plenty for the future. AppMgr III helped with this task. I also added OpenCamera to use instead of the basic camera supplied by Google and Huawei, which also allows direct saving to the SD card (since Android 4.4.2, Google has made it difficult to save pictures and videos directly to the SD card).This phone blows the doors off my Nexus in every way... bigger screen, thinner, much classier looking and much faster (both the processor and wireless modem). I couldn't be happier with the change. For my use, I can't imagine what advantage there would be to anything more expensive. The only feature I'm missing is NFC, which I have never used on my Nexus.",2016年6月24日 在美国审核
Solid phone but does NOT allow tethering on Cricket network.,"Biggest issue is that it does not allow tethering (at least not on the Cricket network).The option to tether exists in the software - but when you enable tethering, the system checks with the carrier to see if you have that service?I think the only way around this is rooting the phone. However, I have not tried this and I don't know for sure if rooting will work.(note, I have tried USB tethering and tethering via Bluetooth, too.Nothing is working.Note: I would pay more for tethering - but this phone is not supported by Cricket.I have tethered on every phone prior to this Honor 5x.I am guessing this is a trend with phones today.I have read the Nexus phones are behaving the same way and making it difficult to tether.It's an important feature for me - so I will probably return this and buy an older phone I know will work with Cricket tethering.Otherwise, the phone is solid, especially for $200.I hope this helps some of you.",2016年2月19日 在美国审核

"Fantastic Device, Stellar Deal","This may very well be the best budget phone I have ever used. The screen looks fantastic, and the phone itself is snappy in terms of performance. The overall build seems solid, and it has decent battery life. The fingerprint reader works better than the one on the iPhone too, which was surprising.Amazon had these on sale during prime day for $120, but truth be told the $200 price of entry is still a great deal.The one minor gripe is the UI, one does have to get used to it if coming from a previous version of Android which is less ""skinned"". However the UI itself is not in the way, just different.In terms of not having the most current version of Android I am not sure it is that big of a deal. The current version has had it's issues, and one just needs to look at the NVidia shield to find that out.The Honor 5X though is probably the best android phone I have used. This is through several devices from HTC, Samsung, and others. It is a sign that the unlocked phones are catching up to the flagship devices. I can recommend this over several flagship phones at this point.",2016年7月18日 在美国审核
My first time using a Huawei phone (2017),"This phone is actually a decent looking, simple to use-phone. Had recently lost my previous Sony xperia phone which was really a nice phone. I had originally purchased this phone on impulse due to losing my other phone. In my opinion the Sony phone was better, quicker, and looked really nice. The honor 5x has a cool look too but the volume/power button placement and the finger print scanner throw me off a little when I use it only because I'm not used to it yet. The speed on the phone I would say is average. There are a couple studders on the phone when recording video but it only happens sometimes, when I do catch video with no lag the quality of it looks better(hopefully something that can be fixed through a software update) besides the lagging in the camera it still is a good camera. The home screen theme is also nice it has an apple iphone kinda look to it (although I would prefer a more original approach, there was still something that made me like the new home theme just seeing something different in Android phones) The battery is also pretty good im not sure what the mah was for the battery but it lasts just as long as my previous phone which had a 3000mah battery but my previous device did last longer on 1% this phone warns you at 3% that your device will power off in 30 seconds don't know if that makes a diff but that was one thing that stood out to me. Haven't tried out the game play on this phone yet but I'm not that big a fan of phone games anyway. Not sure if I left anything out but hope this helps. Overall you can't really complain because the price on this phone is a damn good price. And since it was available for Free same day shipping I was even more urged to get it. I would definitely recommend this to people who are looking for an affordable phone at the last minute :)",2017年3月6日 在美国审核

Buyer beware: L24 model not as described and won't work on TMobile fully,"I bought this phone thinking I'd get the L24 model, which worked like a charm for my brother. However, I got the L21 model -- which does NOT run TMobile 4G as indicated. Tmobile has blocked the bar 12 functionality as it's called on the L21 model, and you can google more about it to learn why and whether the L21 will be fully supported with Tmobile in the future. But at any rate, I can attest to the L24 working beautifully with Tmobile and the L21 working not at all on multiple counts, and to my getting the L21 while the L24 is what was described on Amazon.Be careful, check and double check the model you get (it's stamped on the outside back cover), and return and reorder if needed. Very disappointed with Amazon for mischaracterizing the item. This is one of the best phones in its class -- if, that is, you get the right model.

Shockingly Good,"I bought this as a ""hold me over"" phone, not having very high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised.. First off, the battery in this thing rocks.. I'm so used to not making it a day on my previous phone, to this beast which runs straight through 2 days! Secondly, the fingerprint sensor in the back is phenomenal. I've used these on the Galaxy's before and always considered them to be novelty. The Honor's fingerprint sensor is on the back, right where you're hand would go anyway. Unlocks virtually immediately. The default UI isn't really my style (too iOS like), but a new launcher took care of that. The only ""bug"" I've noticed so far is that when I dismiss a notification , another ""blank"" notification will immediately take it's place, and I have to dismiss that as well. Not a huge issue, but hopefully they will fix it in the Marshmallow release.",2016年7月6日 在美国审核

At times , if the phone sustains light impact , even with a case on, the SD card ( if you are using one ) will become unreadable. Sometimes it will even say the SD card is corrupted. Once again this problem is resolved by simply restarting your phone , however it can get annoying. My previous phone , theMoto G 2nd generation never had this issue.

WOW! Great dual-sim phone,"WOW! What a great phone. I’ve had the Honor 5X for several weeks now, and I am extremely satisfied with it. Both the operating system and the Emotion User Interface immediately upgraded to Android 6.0.1 “Marshmallow” and EMUI 4.0, respectively; both are working flawlessly together.My spouse has a new Motorola Moto 4G Plus, which is also a really nice phone. The Honor 5X, at about half the price of the Moto 4G Plus, is right on par performance wise. And, like the more expensive Moto 4G Plus, the 5X is also equipped with a fingerprint reader and a 1080p full HD display.The dual-sim feature of the Honor 5X is the primary reason I chose this particular phone, and it works perfectly. I am using an AT&amp;T micro sim card in slot 1 and a European nano sim card in slot 2.In addition to the two sim cards, I also have a microSD card installed. After applying system and app updates and tweaking the phone to suit my needs, there is still 7.4GB of the total 16GB of internal storage available for use.While doing research, prior to purchasing this phone, every review I read contained—to varying degrees—negative comments regarding Huawei’s EMUI 3.0 launcher. For lack of a better description, the EMUI launcher is sort of an Android-iOS hybrid. The majority of negative-leaning comments focused on the lack of a separate app drawer. (If you’re not sure what an app drawer is, you can do what I did and Google it.) As mentioned above, my Honor 5X immediately upgraded to EMUI 4.0, so I never used version 3.0 and cannot comment on that particular revision of Huawei’s customized interface. In terms of version 4.0, I am extremely satisfied with the stock launcher. In light of the many negative review comments regarding EMUI, I was fully prepared to install a different launcher immediately upon receipt of the phone. To my surprise, after spending a few hours with EMUI 4.0, I found it to be intuitive and easy to use, with lots on interesting features and tweaks. Bottom line: I like EMUI so much that I’m sticking with it. (For the record, I’ve been using a company-issued iPhone for years, so I’m used to not having a separate App drawer.)Some reviewers noted rare processor delays when multi-tasking while also performing CPU-intensive operations, such as gaming. Those reviews were written back when the Honor 5X was equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor. The phone now comes with a Snapdragon 616 processor installed, which is supposed to be slightly faster. I do not use my phone for gaming, so I have never experienced any delay at all. Quite the opposite: My Honor 5X is extremely snappy, and the 2GB of RAM is more than enough for how I use the phone. Even when multitasking—for example, with browser, email, calendar, contacts, Play Store, photo gallery, and even the flashlight all running simultaneously—there is still 1.1GB of free RAM. This may be because Android 6 “Marshmallow” is better able to manage system RAM than Android 5 “Lollipop” was, not sure.While the Honor 5X is not technically equipped with “fast-charging” capability, it still charges the battery pretty fast. Mine will charge from 30% to 100% in about 2 hours and 10 minutes. That may not qualify as lightning quick, but it’s not bad.One really useful feature—a feature I’d never given much thought to in the past but would not want to be without now—is a notification light. I understand now why it’s a must-have feature for some. It’s far more convenient to simply look for a tiny flashing green light than it is to wake the phone to check for messages, emails, or other notifications.To me, the speaker sounds perfectly fine; certainly far better than many other cell phone speakers I’ve heard. In my humble opinion, sound quality is considerably better than past reviews made it out to be. There’s also an FM radio app that can be enjoyed via headphones, which serve double duty as the radio’s antenna.The full HD (401 ppi) display is very nice. I rarely take photos, so I won’t comment on the quality of the back camera—other than to say: it works; it takes pictures and they look fine to me. As for the front camera, I don’t take selfies or video chat, so I won’t comment on that camera either—except to say that it works when using the mirror app (which, I’m convinced, is an app that exists solely to make me look older and fatter!).One disappointing aspect of this phone is the lack of OTG (on-the-go) capability. OTG would have been a nice feature to include, but not a deal breaker considering all the other features this phone has.All-in-all, if you’re looking for a fast, slim, modern, stylish, metal-cased, dual-sim phone for under $200, you probably can’t go wrong with the Honor 5X. In fact, after doing a week’s worth of research, I’m convinced there’s no other dual-sim phone out there that’s anywhere near comparable for less than $400+. To reiterate what was stated at the beginning of this review: WOW! What a great phone.",2016年10月22日 在美国审核

Amazing phones!!,"To start with we ordered 2 of these phones. One for myself and one for my husband. We're not really tech savvy but I use a ton of email, text and talk as well as banking and everyday organizing on a phone. We had Nokia lumias which are windows platforms for the last 3+ years and decided we needed a change due to not having access or support for many apps that make organization smoother. It takes a while to play with the different settings and apps but it is extremely customizable for both of our different needs. I would also like to express how much I like the color correction setting which I have never seen on a phone before. I have dealt with color blindness all my life and never realized just how much this feature will bring a device to life. I no longer squint to see things that looked faded or washed out before and it has settings for all types of color blindness. The company should definitely advertise more on this feature alone. We were iffy about the size being much larger than our other phones but turns out it's awesome as well. The phone itself is very slim and sleek in design and fits perfectly in your hand. It comes in wonderful packaging and has a very good charger with it and the battery is very good. It holds up throughout major emailing, texting and talk.

"Great phone, Insane features at under $200!!!","Received the phone today and have been using it on wifi for about 4 hours.Most of the negative reviews on here I believe were either written before android 6 became available or those new to android devices.The phone on initial power up automatically downloaded and installed Android 6.01 marshmallow without incident.It did take about 2 hours for OS and all my apps to download and install but after that smooth sailing.In 3d games the phone is responsive and other apps running in the background have caused no slowdowns.The phone can become a bit warm but this is due to the thinness of the device and the aluminum casing.I did alot of research on the sub $200 phone market and I have to say you will not find better in this price bracket.I also have compared to a friends s7 and I saw nothing to warrant the extra $400 for that device.This could be the OnePlus killer.One more point, having an fm radio included at this price is a VERY nice touch!Way to go huawei!",2016年11月28日 在美国审核
Decent phone but painfully slow.,"Slow as molasses. Especially after the Android update that I received shortly after getting the phone. Overall the main thing I like is the fingerprint reader. Camera is so-so. and most apps are painfully slow to load and app-switching is extremely slow. Often I have to kill background apps to free up memory to try and reduce the sluggishness. I plan to try and replace the Huawei-customized version of Android with something else. This will require some tinkering but after going through the xda forums I'm hopeful. Battery life is good.Edit 4/1/2017: Still painfully slow and laggy. When I need to quickly snap a photo or something I am often waiting for a long time (and sometimes the moment is already gone). Difficult to run more than 1 or 2 apps at a time, and I am always killing apps to free up memory. Still have not tried flashing another OS.

This was a gigantic upgrade from my previous phone that was using gingerbread.Cons- The only thing I didn't like was location of the power button, but you get use to it.I'm not tech savvy at all, so I can't really speak to the specs, but I definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants to have a more modern phone without the price tag of the mainstream brands. I would put this phone among my top 3 amazon purchases.",2016年12月24日 在美国审核
Third time's the charm(I hope so)...,"I've only had 2 other Android phones previously.The first was a 40 dollar(absolute peanuts where as everyone knows you could pay as much as $800 &amp; up)model from a very well known established company,that just proved ""get what you payed for"".Well that phone didn't even last 5 months as the screen just decided to just die(on very limited use)one day.So,I basically learned it definitely ""pays"" to get quality electronics.Next phone was a mistake I shall not go through again,as it was a bit more @$100(woo) and I got excited by its 6,000 mAh battery(as it turned out was its only redeeming factor.The brand was totally unknown and had no 3g &amp; 4g speeds that worked,only useless 2g.I complained to the seller because I found out the 3g/4g frequencies were available in Europe &amp; China.I complained to seller that he shouldn't be allowed to sell a model that's made for other countries and he agreed &amp; issued a refund.So,after those 2 phones I was now looking for one with decent fingerprint sensor,as I was totally sick n tired of using/remembering passwords.It would also have to have strong 3g/4g networks and be unlocked.Now finally that's where the Honor 5X had very good craftsmanship and reading as much as possible on the Huawei brand and loved their commitment to backing up the phone with frequent security updates &amp; upgrades to OS.I'll just say I was surprised how well the full 1080p screen looks,especially in its brightness/contrast ratio.If your looking for a phone that also has a very sharp 13 MP rear camera &amp; 5 MP front,this Android just does everything well,just in a solid,but unspectacular kind of way.I believe its one of best values at under $200 plus it comes with warranty of the Product extends for a period of 12 months for the Host unit, 6months for Battery and Charger.",2017年3月2日 在美国审核
Worked pretty well on the start,"Worked pretty well on the start, but after some time, updates and new apps it started to lag. Then it started to lag real bad. I kept uninstalling apps and reverting versions to check if it would get better. Sometimes it did... for a while.When I moved to another phone it took me a while to move all apps, so I used both phones for a few days. Meanwhile I removed or reverted apps when I got them in the new phone and after some time the Honor 5X was working just great again. I didn't identify the apps that did that, as I worked in batches, but it seemed to be something from the Google updates that caused that - not something you can live without unfortunately.I passed the phone along to my brother after a factory reset + default apps update. The phone was okay by then, but after a few weeks he told me it started lagging again - new updates were done and apps were installed, so hard to tell what caused that. My brother has the latest update and it is still somewhat bad.It might work better with a custom ROM that has the latest android, but the original rom is not that good.",2017年6月30日 在美国审核
Honor 5X,"I only gave this 4 stars because I've had it less than 24 hours and it's my theory that everything has room for improvement. I LOVE this phone. I admit I had to look up a couple of videos to figure out how to access the simm card. Thank you users, for making these available. The first thing that really impressed me was the ring tones. I can actually hear ALL of them. Certain tones don't register on my ears and that was a problem with my last phone.The second thing is that it's incredibly intuitive to use, though some things are still a mystery and I'm accessing some things accidently and not being able to remember where I found them. (I'm not incredibly tech savvy).The third thing is the beautifully clear photos. I'm extremely pleased with the quality for the price that this phone offers.Oh yes, big bonus.

Like It - No need to replace OS,"This is a good phone for the price. Don't agree with other reviewers that you need to replace the operating system. The one that comes with the phone works just fine. I am used to my iphone and found the transition painless. Set everything up in a half day - though it worked right out of the box. Micro SD worked well. Need to make sure you get it with the proper high speed transfer rates for photo and video recording. I used Samsung SDXC 64GB Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card and it worked fine. The only downside is that the camera quality is very middle of the road. Color is just a bit off and the resolution is not good enough to give you a sharp, crisp image.

(Owner for 3 months) Well worth it for price and will last you.,"Tired of paying several hundreds of dollars for name-brand smartphones that have several if not dozens of pointless features? This is the phone for you! I've long been a fan of Samsung for reasons such as durability and the fact that Apple slows down older iPhones to force the hand of consumers, but the Galaxy line was getting pricier and pricier as time went on. That being said, I switched from a Galaxy S4 Active to Honor 5X and I can never go back. I thought the iPhone 5 was the pinnacle of how a smartphone should feel, both in regard to size and weight, and felt a similar way to the Galaxy series. I admit, at first, the Honor 5X is a bit lofty in your hand. You will adapt. Just be sure to buy a case. While for those who have smaller pockets it will be a bit of a hassle, the display is worth it. You can not get more bang for your buck with this Chinese off-brand.The ppi is beautiful on the larger phone, so much so you will think it's a 4k screen. I've had the phone for over 3 months now and use the fingerprint pad on the back of the phone to unlock it exclusively. I can not emphasize how much I appreciate the smartphone for such a price. If the display wasn't enough, try out the camera. This is the perfect devise for those who are tired of the dominating forces of smartphone producers shoving overpriced name-brand devices in your face. I would highly recommend giving the unlocked phone a shot: slots for two SIM cards and expandable memory!",2017年1月14日 在美国审核
Best budget phone by far!,"I've lost count of the number of smartphones I've owned. Between myself, my wife and two boys, I think we've had them all.

The fingerprint reader is excellent and my sondra has different fingers linked to specific people's numbers. So to call me he just unlocks the phone with his finger and viola. Call made.The camera is good as is the battery life. Love the SD card slot and screen.The only downside is the UI, it that is easily replaceable.I'm thinking of buying another for son number 2.We are on tmobile and the service is flawless.",2016年3月1日 在美国审核
Good short term phone,"I'm using it right now, 1-4 months I loved it, it worked perfectly. 4-12 months slow progression to poor functioning. I think the updating to the apps and O.S. has been taxing the hardware too much and now when I'm running 2-3 programs at a time it freezes a lot and slows down. I need to use the phone manager to clean it daily and reboot it regularly. With that being said, it was 200 and if been milking it along for 1.5 years so I'm not upset with my purchase. I was an iPhone user and wanted to try Android without a big investment so I think it was worth it.",2018年5月16日 在美国审核
Love it! This phone is perfect for my needs ...,"Love it!This phone is perfect for my needs and especially for under two-hundred dollars.The fingerprint sensor is spot-on - always unlocks the phone every time (also great because you can use it for authentication in others apps (if those apps support it), such as financial/banking ones, so no need to keep track of all those passwords).Just having the fingerprint sensor itself on a less expensive phone is an excellent addition.The screen looks nice and doesn't seem to kill the battery too quickly.I'd like to see the speaker quality improved - for all the good parts of the phone, it's sad to see the experience with it hindered by the speaker - music played through it sounds muddled and not good - phone calls through it are hard to understand and not loud enough.",2016年9月19日 在美国审核

Great value phone,"This is a great phone for the $200 range. You can't really compare it to a high-end phone, but it does most everything a smart phone needs to do.Battery life is decent, not great - will last a few hours on heavy use. Build quality is good - the back is aluminum and feels much more solid than plastic phones (like the Nexus 5X). The screen is OK, not anywhere close to the high end phones, but completely serviceable. The UI is not very good, but I replaced it with a 3rd party launcher and it mostly feels fine. Processor is OK - phone can be sluggish at times, but it's to be expected for the price range. Fingerprint sensor can be fidgety, but most other phones in this range don't have one at all. Has expandable microsd for storage, as well as room for a second sim if you travel frequently.The main disappointment is the camera - camera can take a long time to start up (which can make you lose good shots) and pictures are just decent, not great. Also lacks a 5ghz antenna.Overall, I use this as my main phone and it's held up well over the past two months. It's a very practical phone if you customize the UI and settings to your preferences.Edit - I have dropped this phone from a distance of about 3-4 feet onto hardwood floors and concrete about 5-6 times now (without a case!) and it has not cracked or had any visible damage.

it does have an expansion slot for micro SD so thats good in case you need additional storge,"Overall, for a 200 dollar phone I dont think there are any phones out there that can beat it in terms of built quality, spec and design (competitors in this range are Moto G, Asus Zenphone 2). Being 16gb phone only, it does have an expansion slot for micro SD so thats good in case you need additional storge. The phone also packs 2 sim card slots, 1 mini and 1 mico sim slot. This is a great feature if you want to travel aboard so you can have your sim from the states and local sim at where you are staying. Only thing missing is NFC so people looking into using NFC for payment will have to skip this phone.The only real complain I have is that the android skin Huawei uses doesnt have an app drawer.

Set to Animation offYou can also set window animation scale to off.Original Review below:Been using this for one month and one week. I wish I returned it before my return period ended. I play a game called Dragon Soul. It played it well enough that it would only pause for a second at the end of battles so not a big deal. I did the update on the phone today and it messed it up. When I play the game it pause once a second while in battle so it pretty much sucks. I tried changing to high performance but made no difference. I will buy another phone. So disappointed. If you need a phone that will play games then this is not the one for you. I came from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and wish I could still use that but I switched carriers so this time I will get a Flagship phone. If all you need is to make calls, send text/emails, and mild web surfing then you should...... get another phone (joking, just really sad that I did the update).",2017年4月10日 在美国审核
Good phone if you add an SD card and Android Exodus,"This is a good phone, with two stipulations:1. Put a fast micro SD card in it (I used this one: SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB UHS-I/U3 Micro SDHC)2.

This is completely gone with Exodus, and the phone now is as fast as my iphone was before it.I do miss the iphone camera. That's still the best, especially the panorama feature.But for the money, this is really nice. I had the Nexus 5x for a little while before this, and this is just as good.

Snapchat really slows it down, especially if you have even one other app open. The speaker is very loud though, and the camera is okay. I probably wouldn't buy this phone again though.

Best bang for the buck!,"I did a lot of research on various full featured Android phones, and I about had a heart attack to see what they were going for.Trying to to find the ""best bang for the buck"", I was pleasantly surprised to find this Honor 5x Unlocked Smart Phone rated almost as well as the big name phones, but at a modest price.I was pleased to see that it possessed an 8 core processor that runs at quite a decent processor speed, that the camera quality, sound quality, screen size and resolution were all quite respectable as well.Then I saw that it possessed the second to last Android version (Lollipop) of software.... all for about $180 new.It was also an Unlocked GSM phone (I have T-Mobile). What's not to like?So... I bought one for my wife and she loves it.It truly measures up to what all was said about it in the press.Now... Unless you want cutting edge features (which will be second rate in 12 months anyway) and are willing to pay 2 or 3 times the price for NOT 2 or 3 times better feature specifications... then this phone may be a very good ""close reach"" for you, as it does most everything well that most people want.And if it does happen to get broken or stolen, it won't be nearly as financially painful to you.Sure, there are a few small things that you have to get used to that are done differently on this model verses other Android phones, but hey... I can live with 'em for the big $ savings!Good luck!",2016年7月21日 在美国审核
I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS,"Big disappointment. Don't waste your time or money on this brick. It lasted less than a year and then the phone gave out. The battery takes a full day to charge now and 15 minutes to lose that charge. Now the phone no longer even turns on but when I did those last few hours, it would restart randomly and tried to reset to factory setting. If by a miracle it turned on again, I can't even use the phone for calls or texts because it won't read the nano sim card tray any longer. Essentially it's a brick. And when I tried to return it because it was still under warranty and will be for two months, they gave me the run around and never sent me a label to return it. I tried for a week and each day I talked to their customer service they promised the label would be there by the end of the next day. I wanted to save money by buying a budget phone but at what cost really?",2017年5月5日 在美国审核

Great phone for the Price,"So far, this smart phone puts out a lot. It has a lot of features from fingerprint security even down to a compass and its going quite well. The only thing thus far that I would consider a con is that it is not allowing me to do USB tethering from PC to the phone. (If anybody knows how to do this without rooting the device and there is something I have to activate within the phone, let me know please). My initial BLU phone used to do it. In the end, it is a great phone. Perfect for those who are on a budget and its able to do just as much as the well known smart phones.Also thus far it seems as if it has a good battery life &amp; charges fairly quick.",2017年1月1日 在美国审核

Absolutely Worth It.,"This phone is an excellent buy for the price. The only thing I disliked was having to convert all my .WAV music to MP3. Otherwise, it'd play, but only if you clicked on the file. The music player would not recognize it until it was in the MP3 format (true for more than just the stock player, as well, which was strange).Nevertheless, for the price, I'd buy this phone over the top of the line every day of the week. Well worth the purchase. Haven't dropped any calls, even though I don't live in the strongest cell area. It also works great as a wireless WIFI hotspot to link my tablet to.",2016年12月5日 在美国审核
"A good mid range phone, actually very good in my opinion","Got it in March of this year and works a charm. This phone has decent credentials and a quality build. Dual SIM cards means not hassles when I am overseas. Has the same functionality as many other expensive phones at half the cost.Huawei is giving Samsung a run for it's money at a much lower cost. At the end of the day I'm very impressed with this phone for the price paid. And if it does get smashed and I send it to high tech heaven, it's not going break the bank. I'll get another and still be ahead of the game. It does what I need it to do and that's fine by me. Hope this helps",2017年11月17日 在美国审核
"Very fast, long battery, durable, looks great. Installed nova launcher and love this device!!! buy it!","GREAT PHONE!I am very techy.I am a college student and am ALWAYS on my phone. Use for social media, snapchat, texting, email, web browsing, MUSIC, netflix, youtube. very little gaming, but sometimes clash of clans.I was coming from an HTC ONE M7.I have rooted all of my devices in the past but do not feel the need to root this device!Design:Metal body does not feel as metallic as my HTC did.this metal feels a little more flimsy but MUCH BETTER than the plastic body you find on many phones like the samsung. Speaker on the bottom of phone is just fine. plenty loud and sounds pretty good even with volume up! Charging port has a nice click feel to it when you plug the usb cable into it. Same goes for the headphone jack. Only negative to the exterior design is the stock screen protector! this phone does not have gorilla glass or a special fingerprint reducing coating on it so a screen protector is a must! the stock screen protector however scratched in the first 24 hours of use.I ordered a two-pack or tempered glass screen protectors off amazon for $8 to solve this issue 100%.Screen: The 1080p screen is great! very visible outside and plenty bright in all situations. the resolution is plenty! you have to hold the phone super close to your face to make out any pixels and even then, it is almost impossible to find any pixels. I give the screen a 5/5.Camera:the camera is just so-so.I give it a 3.5/5.This camera will certainly get the job done and is acceptable in low light situations. The camera app that honor uses is great, has plenty of manual camera adjustments.however when you use an app like snapchat the camera quality is not the best but is certainly acceptable!The LED flash is SUPER bright! Whether you are taking a photo in the dark or using it as a flashlight the led flash is the brightest i have seen in any smartphone today!Fingerprint:I give this a 4.5/5.it works great but takes about 48 hours of use to get used to placing your finger just right on the sensor to get it to recognize. but once you get used to it, it works great.. Unlocks the phone VERY fast!Battery life: I am a very HEAVY user, i watch videos and brows the web constantly throughout the day.I do not game however.I have NO problem getting a full day out of my honor 5x.Starting use at about 9AM and using my phone pretty regularly with the wifi and the bluetooth on all day i get to 9PM with about 15-10% charge.And i am using the ""Normal"" (highest) performance level setting.Charging: Others have complained about how long the phone takes to charge. I wonder if these people have not updated to the latest software or something.Mine is taking about 2.5-3 hours to charge from 5% to 100%.This is as fast as some other very high end phones but is plenty fast for me.User Interface:This is honestly my favorite part of the phone.I am coming from both apple and android phones in the past. I have used cyanogenmod on my android phones (rooted).I have not used the Honor launcher (EMUI3.1).The first thing i did when i got this phone was download both Google Now Launcher and Nova Launcher.However, without rooting there are certain software items you can not get rid of.With samsung and HTC phone you are left with their terribly complicated and bloated software (calculators, weather app, notification menu, settings menu, and lock screens) .I LOVE the EMUI weather app, phone dialer, notification menu, settings menu, lock screen, and notification drop down.I am not going to root this phone because with just a new launcher this phone rocks!very snappy and smooth interface and animations and transitions.This phone is plenty powerful even though it only has 2gb or ram and an older snapdragon 616 processor.It lasts all day and does not get hot, even under heavy use.Feels great in the hand! has not lagged or bogged down on me yet even though i use this thing for all kinds of tasks throughout the day.I am VERY pleased and recommend this phone to everyone i know looking for a new phone. please change out the stock screen protector with a tempered glass one!Im using this on AT&amp;T and am getting very fast speeds and call quality in the carolinas.",2016年2月26日 在美国审核

"Bad headphone jack, bad Huawei service","The Honor 5X is a pretty phone, but lacks durability.I got this phone for my 15 year old son in April 2017.He uses it daily, protects it with a Spigen Rugged Armor case, and has not subjected it to any mistreatment.In October, he reported that the headphone jack no longer worked.I started a warranty return claim online with Huawei.Before they issued me a packing slip, Huawei required me to send them 6 photos of the phone (from all angles).After 3 days, the phone was delivered back unrepaired. Inside, a form letter tersely stated ""the device has suffered liquid damage which voids the warranty"".O RLY? I checked with my son, who said he did not expose the phone to water.I called Huawei and got a very obliging and apologetic person on the phone who was sweet as can be, and said that he would escalate the case.I then got an email from Huawei repeating that examination of the phone showed liquid damage that voided the warranty.The only liquid that might have touched the phone was a few raindrops.My overall takeaway from this experience: this phone is not durable enough for everyday use. And Huawei customer service is minimal and misleading.My son's buying himself an iPhone now.And I will never again purchase anything made by Huawei, no matter how shiny or cheap.Buyer beware!",2017年12月9日 在美国审核

SLOW. LAGS. CRASHES!,"SLOW. LAGS. CRASHES! This phone is a huge disappointment and I hope I can prevent others from making the mistake of buying this phone. I will start with the positives - the display is beautiful, calls are good, fast storage, expandable memory, and fingerprint reader is great.BUT, I need my phone to be reliable for 2 things - playing Music and Navigation. This phone fails at both.Playing music often stutters and even worse with bluetooth. And If i need Google maps, I don't even bother with it. It can't do both things without risking becoming unresponsive during navigation. I use an Amazon Echo Dot in my car now to handle music.Google maps is something I use every day. I can't tell you how many times it has taken MINUTES to actually get navigation going due to lags and crashes. This has caused a lot of stressful moments where I nearly threw this thing out the window.This phone can only do one thing at a time, and not well. I often deal with Facebook Messenger problems too, lags, total unresponsiveness and crashes. If someone messages me on Messenger while navigating it is certain that all hell will break loose. I don't have a lot of apps. Just the ones I need. I don't see any other optimizations I can do with the device. It is what it is.On paper, this is a great phone for the money. In reality, it can't handle normal daily tasks.This phone just is not powerful enough to provide a decent Android experience. In conclusion - STAY AWAY!!",2017年10月15日 在美国审核
Best phone in this price range.,"Fingerprint scanner is super accurate. Build feels very premium. I recommend using a tempered glass screen protector as the phone doesn't have gorilla glass.

Honor 5X: Outstanding value.,"Been using this phone three weeks now with no problems at all. Just installed the first big update the other day and it went very smoothly. Bought this for my wife's birthday and was worried she'd be put off by the larger size but nope, she has never even mentioned it. Her previous phone was an Honor 3C and this one is better in every way. She is especially impressed by the battery life (YMMV of course).Pros: 4G LTE. Large, bright, clear screen, 1080 x 1920 @ 400 ppi. Very nice. Decent cameras, good WiFi and Bluetooth performance, expandable memory, 3000 mAh battery last's her all day and then some unless she overuses it. Fingerprint scanner if you want to use one. One of our favorite features is the ability to light up the lock screen with a light double-tap, no need to touch a button (that option needs to be turned on in: Settings &gt; Motion Control). I have a Galaxy S4 and I wish I could get my phone to do this. Is it a feature in Android 5.1 or a Huawei feature? Little in the way of bloatware.Cons: No dual-band WiFi, 2.4 GHz band only. No top of the line processor but it's still faster than the Honor 3C and it's still peppy enough (for us anyway). I'm not a big fan of the Huawei user interface (EMUI 3.1) and if I could switch it off I would like to try stock Android, but it's not all that bad and it's the same as the UI on her Honor 3C so she was comfortable with it on day 1. Non-removable battery.Speakerphone performance is OK and call quality is OK. It connects to the car's Bluetooth automatically (after initial setup) every time she gets in the car and works fine. Considering the $200. price tag this phone is a great value and so far we have nothing to complain about. Would buy again and would recommend it to others.",2016年2月29日 在美国审核

I dropped my other phone of 3 years and decided to make the purchase because I needed an unlocked phone, and quick (shipping was quick with Amazon).Would recommend this to anybody who: doesn't care for high end details but wants to be able to use apps, read PDFs, browse the internet, text, whatever, take photos of nice quality, needs an unlocked phone -- quicklyAs I mentioned, 4.5/5 for the pros (and cons) given the price. For under $200, I'd say it's definitely a 4.5, a 5 on good days, a 4 on the bad ones. However, if this phone was in the $400 range, I'd probably rate it a 3.Recommendations to Huawei: I think the UI could use an upgrade, but it's not bad. Perhaps make an ""instruction manual"" for older consumers.",2016年12月26日 在美国审核
"Good hardware, Poor Software.","So, like most people, my biggest problem with this phone isn't the hardware. The phone as a whole feels great! The fingerprint scanner is wonderful and very accurate, the screen is large and vibrant, but overall the software that comes with the phone (EMUI 3.1) is terrible. The Snapdragon 615 processor that comes with the phone is powerful, but hampered greatly by EMUI. I tried to use it for about two months, but it became unbearably slow, with frequent framerate drops, reboots, and poor app performance.The good news is, Huawei makes rooting the device relatively easy. All you have to do is make an account on their website, request an unlock code for your phone, and you're good to go. Having done that, and installed a custom ROM, this phone became less of a brick and more of a wonderful powerhouse. I'm currently running it with a custom Android Marshmallow 6.1 with an unofficial CyanogenMod 13 Nightly. I couldn't be happier.3/5 stars for the sub-par software, but really nice hardware.",2016年5月8日 在美国审核
"Amazing, Beautiful Phone",This phone is amazing for the price that you pay. There are several things that are great about this phone and some things that are bad about itThe Good:Battery Life: Best battery life I've ever had in a phone. A full charge lasts me through the day without a problem and I am a pretty heavy phone user so a huge thumbs up on the battery.Fingerprint Sensor: The fingerprint sensor is the highlight of this phone considering its price. It reacts super fast and I haven't had any problems with it recognizing my finger. Not only does it unlock your phone you can set it up to open apps with certain fingers and can even be used to do tasks while the phone is unlocked.Screen: It might not be the best looking 1080p panel out there but it looks great. It gets bright enough to see in the daylight and dark enough to not hurt your eyes if you wake up in the middle of the night to check your phoneVersatility: What I mean by this is that since the phone is unlocked you can use it with any GSM phone company that use the bands that this phone support. I am currently on Straight Talk and it works flawlessly. It has dual sims so you can use it with a company number as well as a personal number on the same phone.Design: Beautiful. That's the one word that I would use to describe it. The brushed metal finish feels premium and looks premium in your hands.The Bad:Speaker: I'm glad that I have a wireless speaker I can connect this to. Music sounds awful coming through the speaker and I don't think any equalizer apps will fix this. But on the plus side it gets loud enough to wake the dead with an alarm.Cameras: Megapixels don't mean a thing when the pixels don't look good. The camera constantly over or under exposes photos and they just don't look very good. But what should you expect from a $200 phone with all of the amazing features already?That's the end of my review. I hope that this review helps with your impulse buying habits and you make the right choice for what you need.,2016年3月29日 在美国审核

... month now and I gotta say I am quite pleased with this purchase,"I have had this phone for about a month now and I gotta say I am quite pleased with this purchase.My previous phone was a Lumia 521 so going from that to this phone is a world of difference,aside from the obvious of having a different OS. As of right now I have not had any problems with it,never freezes with the exception of snapchat once in a great while. Being a bit of a heavy user I would say the battery life is great. I can be playing games and videos for a good 4 hours and uses only 10-20% of the battery. Love the fingerprint unlock feature,and it is very conveniently placed. It also is very quick. Camera is pretty nice as well. Both front and back take pretty clear pictures. The speaker is decent, not the greatest though.The only complaint that I have is that I dropped it once before I got my case and now the power button gets stuck whenever I press it, which sends it into a loop of restarting itself until I manage to get it unstuck. However there is a secondary way to power the phone off besides waiting for it to time out.All in all,I really love this phone, especially for the price.",2016年10月4日 在美国审核

Beautiful phone but don't commit without reading the low reviews,"Update 2/17/17 (added stars a star)Utilized the phone when I went to egypt, performance seemed to be much better after swapping networks.The performance of the phone seems to rely heavily on the network it's on for some applications. When running w/ a slower service some applications do become unresponsive and seem to drain resources of the phone itself. While away from my usual network on an international carrier the phone did seem to perform much better (excluding normal service drops). The overall quality of the phone has been good and the device has held up well.Update 1/25/17Phone has become unresponsive in some instances with reduced performance. I've tried restoring the phone and playing with safe mode settings but any performance improvements are short lived. I'll have no apps open and the phone sometimes will even struggle just one. I would return it if I could and get a more expensive phone.It's a pain to have a touch screen phone jump around on you all the time if you are just typing out a text message.Original Oct 2016Great build, GUI, and features. Now for the bad part. Right out of the box the phone is beautiful and defiantly contends with higher priced devices as far as the screen and features themselves. However the only issue I've had with the phone is very major. Right out of the box and even after optimal tweaks, many apps are sluggish when launching even when others aren't open right out of the box and after two days of messing around to try to fix the issue. I had a $100 phonepreviousltwhich defiantly lacked in features and resolution when compared to this phone but it performed much better in those simple tasks. I have recommended this budget phobe to a few people but after buying and testing it myself, it didn't match the hype as far as performance.

90% of an iPhone for 30% of the price.,"I'd love a new iPhone, but there's no way I can justify the price. The base 16gb unlocked iPhone 6s here on Amazon is about $600. So what can you get for, say, 1/3 of the price? With the Huawei Honor 5X, probably about 85-90% of the phone.It's quite an elegant looking phone, well built, with a nicely machined polished aluminum back, 5.5 inch 1080p screen (403 pixels per inch), and good sized 3000 mAh battery. It's a bit thicker than the iPhone (mostly the big battery), but still very light and feels comfortable in the hand.The phone comes with a very good, fast fingerprint sensor, which can unlock the phone and be set to do other tasks such as functioning as a camera button, unlocking apps, etc. The display is sharp with great viewing angles and vibrant colors. It is a bit more reflective than the iPhone so slightly harder to see in bright sunlight, but still very usable.Indoors it gives the iPhone 6 screen a run for its money. Headphone sound is loud and full, with good bass and definition (I am a recording musician, so I care about this stuff). The external speaker is not as good. It's loud enough, but is a bit harsh, with not much bass, and it's mono.Inside you get space for two sim cards AND a micro SD card. This makes it more useful than the base 16GB iPhone because you can add up to 128GB of additional storage for very little money. The extra storage is not quite as seamless as Huawei could have made it, though (more on that below).The phone came out-of-the-box with Android 5.1 Lollipop, but immediately updated itself to 6.0 Marshmallow. The thing is, Huawei has modified this with their EMUI 4.0 interface, and in so doing weakened one of Marshmallow's greatest advantages over Lollipop: the ability to seamlessly use the SD card as regular internal storage. You CAN still move apps there, but you have to move each one manually in Settings, and if there is an app update, you have to move it again. Still better than not HAVING that option, as in iPhone, but not ideal. Hopefully Huawei will fix this in a future EMUI update.As for the rest of EMUI, it's a matter of taste. If you like iOS, you'll probably be comfy with EMUI. The folders and stock icons look similar and everything moves very smoothly, with attractive transitions. The notifications and shortcuts are on separate panels, and both notifications and settings have very iOS-like icons. If you like stock Android you will probablydislike this, especially no app drawer, and very little consistency with Android's Material Design. Still, this is easily fixable. Just download and instal Nova Launcher or Google Now Launcher. For me, I had Nova on my previous phone, butafter organizing EMUI, have decided I like it enough to keep it for now.The 13mprear camera is good, but not great. Again 85-90% of iPhone's camera capability for 1/3 the price. In good light you will get good to great results. In lower light it can get grainy. Also the shutter speed is a bit slower than I'd like. There are some good adjustments for point and shoot photographers, including HDR, but it is not a serious photographer's main tool. The front camera takes decent selfies but nothing to write home about. I have not done much with the video yet.Performance has been smooth, with only a very occasional lag when lots of apps are loaded. I am not a heavy gamer, and probably would not recommend it for that. I'm sure raw performance (Antutu scores and such) are far from flagship. But in everyday use, it's snappy enough. YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, and Netflix load quickly and work smoothly, and the picture quality is excellent. Music streaming is good, with no hiccups or stutter.Oh, and it IS a phone.Call quality is great, with good volume even in traffic or a store. Stock dialer and contacts are elegantly done, with access to notepad, calendar and calculator right from the call screen. SMS and MMS work perfectly (once I updated the Family Mobile APN). I get 4g LTE coverage from T-Mobile's towers here. Wifi is strong and switches well. Bluetooth works perfectly and I've had no problem with either speakers or my ASUS Zenwatch 2 Android Wear smartwatch. No complaints here.In the end, the only place Huawei obviously cut corners is in the boxed accessories, or rather, lack of them: Not even a cheap set of earbuds, no case (Get one! the finish is too nice to mess up), and an anemic 1 amp charger and piece-of-junk cable. They did include a screen protector, already perfectly applied on my device. no bubbles. But it IS a fingerprint magnet.Deal breakers: If you need NFC for Android Pay or similar, this phone is not for you. If you constantly push the performance envelope, get another phone. But if you're like 95% of us that use phones, save yourself $400 and get this. That will pay for a LOT of nights out with you significant other, or get you a GREAT stand-alone camera that will beat ANYTHING on a smartphone. You'll be pleased with the performance, look good with it, and have a heavier wallet.",2016年9月16日 在美国审核

"Prime example of ""today's cheap phone is last year's expensive phone""","The only negative comments I have for this phone are the lack of gyroscope (for photosphere) and stock android. Other than that, this phone really should be worth twice as much as it is priced. 1080p display, microsd card (on top of a not-some-puny 8gb internal storage), 120 fps camera, fingerprint sensor, dual sim, LTE, etc. For $199, I can definitely overlook the lack of gyroscope and stock android.The EMUI skin also surprised me. I am absolutely disgusted with that iOS look, however, the skinning didn't bog down the OS like I would expect as TouchWiz and some other skinned OS have shown. Still, the iOS look is ugly. But again, for $199, that can be overlooked. Also, with EMUI, there is no shortcut to battery screen from the pulldown notifications. That is rather annoying. You can long tap the ultra battery shortcut but that will give you only battery saving options. I want to be able to diagnose screen on time and battery consumption from the shortcut without going through system settings.The lockscreens are also horrible. Then again, this phone is $199.This ia a prime example of ""today's cheap phone is last year's expensive phone."" Lately a bunch of budget phones have been out but they're still just as terrible as phones from two years ago. Technology is supposed to get cheaper for the same piece of technology but we haven't been observing that with a bunch of other ""budget options"" (Cough cough Moto G). This H5X begs to differ and proves that for $199, you can get last year's near premium phone for a budget price.",2016年2月8日 在美国审核
I was very pleased with this budget smart phone when I saw it,"My husband bought Honor 5x to me as a surprise last weekend.I was very pleased with this budget smart phone when I saw it. The Pokemon Go game just launched recently, and I was eager to try. However, at the beginning, I am depressed a little bit when encountering some common problems.But when I finally find the solution, I was thrilled. With such little budget, Honor 5x performed so well and can be compared to any other costly smartphone. So, for those who want play Pokemon go with Honor 5x, here are some tips.• When you log in to Pokemon go, you may notice that there are an error “GPS not found”. What you need to do is to update Google map and Google play services. After that, open google map to confirm that it can detect your exact location. With Google map on, go back to open Pokemon go. It should work.• Another problem is, in the screen, you may see an error “Failed to detect location”. What you need to do is to go to settings to find Build number, tap on the number seven times; it will tell you now you are a builder. Then go back to settings, you will find Developer options enabled. Go to developer options, disable the Mock location option. You will see what is happening.• Another problem is that, the AR mode does not work, which means your camera can not be on when catching a pokemon . It is not pleasant! Honor 5x does have gyroscope, but it need certain file in the system to support it. So far, as I know, you need to download a Marshmallow by yourself.You can google it to see how to do. Or just wait EMUI 4.1, the current version is EMUI3.1.Haivei is randomly sending out the update, so you should got it sooner or later.Anyway, I am very happy with Honor 5x, since it can allow me to play Pokemon Go with kids.

"Slow, quirky and downright awful","I came to this via a Nexus 4 and then a Nexus 5. If you are at all used to a decent phone, this will disappoint you immeasurably. Slow, large, and packed full of horrible bloatware, this phone was the bane ofmy life for the four months I endured it. I managed to find a Samsung S7 Edge and boy what a joy that was after the Honor 5X.This thing is so badly designed I don't know where to begin. Couple of examples:- if you're listening to audio, say in the car, and you hit the stopwatch you get an audio ticker which you cannot disable.- if you have this connected to your car bluetooth, you can use your car controls to stop the audio, but not restart it (Maxda CX5)- if you use the dual SIM (which I did as I work in one country and live in another), 90% of the time, you will have to manually reconnect one SIM or the other because it will have trouble finding the network.There are a ton of other stupid glitches that are the result of cheap tech and bad design.

Dont buy if VR and 360 Videos are something you are interested in.,"I have owned a lot of cheaper phones and the more expensive ones like Galaxy and iPhone 6S. I was hopping this would be something special. It wasn't. I bought this to replace my Asus Zenfone 6. The only thing I felt that was better on the Honor was the graphics compared to the ASUS. The speed was slower, sound on phone quality was so so, the feel is about the same with the nice metal back. Now for some of the problems I have with it. The LTE keeps dropping out on both T mobile and ATT, a full reset will fix it, but it gets old reloading the apps. Its not an every day issue, maybe a once every week issue. Maybe I just have a bad egg. But here is something the phone does not have... A Gyroscope. For those that dont know what a gyroscope is used for, its to view 360 VR videos or run a lot of the Google cardboard VR apps. Yes there are work arounds and yes there are other VR apps that will work, but you dont get the full range as you do with a Gyroscope.My review:Speed - 2 starsInterface - 2 StarsGraphics - 4 starsCamera - 3 starsSound - 2.5 starsI wanted to like it but couldn't",2016年8月25日 在美国审核

Pic with Honor 5x taken at Walmart garden center,"Received the phone on Saturday.I was in the market for a new one as I dropped my Nexus 6 at work earlier in the week and cracked the screen.Motorola wouldn't repair as the phone was registered in Grand Cayman (long story...Ebay purchase) and local repair shops wanted $250 because they wouldn't just replace the glass but the digitizer too.So I didn't want to spend a whole lot of $ as I just purchased the Nexus 6 in October, 2015 and I like to upgrade my phone annually (out-of-pocket/unlocked w/T-mobile).After debating between this, the LG Nexus 5x, and the Huawei Nexus 6p, I went with the Honor 5x.Reviews were favorable and price was right.I particularly liked the battery life, fingerprint scanner, and screen size/clarity.The mixed reviews on the camera almost made me change my time.So my personal impression after using the phone heavily for two full days is that it's well worth $200.I have an iphone 6s through work and I actually prefer the look/feel of the Honor 5x, primarily due to a larger screen.I switched to the Nova Launcher and now have app tray which I'm familiar with.My biggest complaint about the phone is the wifi.I downloaded an album via google play and it took about 15 minutes to download on wifi!Wifi is molasses slow and I'm not sure why they chose to cut corners on such a critical experience on a mobile phone (update:downloaded 2 more albums tonight and took about 10-15 mins for both...still slow but not as bad as first experience).Outside of that, the camera actually takes nice pictures.I haven't really tried it in low light situations which seems to be professional reviews main complaint with it.It does have a lot of different modes to choose from (good food anyone?).The strongest point to me is the battery.Much better than the Nexus 6 which I love.I'm weird about battery drain...when it gets below 50%, I need to put it on a charger.The phone doesn't have quick charge capability but you will get a faster charge using a higher rated (amp) charger than the one that comes with the phone.You should just toss that one in the trash unless you have no choice.All the reviewers complaints about Huawei's software is overblown.Get a launcher to overlay and you'll be fine.Now Huawei, can you release 6.0 so we can catch up?Not sure why the phone wasn't released with it but one of Motorola's biggest selling points is stock android operating system and quick software update releases.Honor 5x doesn't have a stock android operating system which isn't a bad thing in my opinion but quick software updates would make Huawei an even stronger contender in the mobile cell phone market.Recommend the phone as the pros far outweigh the cons.",2016年3月22日 在美国审核
"It's not perfect, but I love it!","It's not perfect, but I love it! Everything works really well, and the design is awesome, It freezes on rare occasions, but I guess it happens with every phone - restart usually helps. The battery can last throughout the date if you don't use too much Internet, so I usually charge it every evening. The camera is great! Pictures are of very good quality in daylight, not so much during night time, but well, I never seen phones that take good pictures at night.

Faulty phone - Huawei just does not care,"This promised to be a good phone. A good phone which, on top of it all, was also surprisingly cheap. However, from its very first days, my unit was slow and lagged quite a lot. Because I know so little about phones, I just assumed that was what happened when you bought a budget phone. Fast forward a few months and the phone starts not only lagging, but frequently freezing and rebooting - for no reason and with no word of warning. After showing the phone to a friend who knows actually knows phones, I was told that it was obviously faulty and that I should call on the warranty.This is the reason why I will not buy a Huawei phone ever again: in three separate times, I wrote to Huawei mentioning the problem (in their official customer service website). But there was never any reply - not even the plain acknowledgment of having received the email. The phone is under warranty and it seems to be faulty. Customer service, Huawei’s customer service, just does not care.Imagine this: you buy a phone, it has a warranty, it is faulty, and the brand leaves you out to dry. Are you willing to take the risk?",2017年4月27日 在美国审核

Great phone for the price!

No Nonsense. You will find what you want from this device.,"This is everything I needed and wanted in an update from my second generation Moto X. I don't think I made any real sacrifices in terms of hardware design or software. I am overall very excited to continue to learn about this device, and extend my knowledge to Huawei and Honor, as well as what the budget market looks like and turns into.So far after 5 days of use, I have had no hiccups. I am able to use my 5X the same way I used my Moto X, but with this new phone I get better battery life and a larger screen that's just as beautiful as my Moto X was(I had that custom made and engraved, so much fun). I have noticed that a lot of internet resources have said the EMUI is hit or miss for them but I really enjoy the different approach Honor has taken with it, and it really helps me save battery, so I'm happy. If you like Android, don't shy away because of the UI, you can get around a lot of it and if you give it a fair shot, it might surprise you too.For $200, you get more than your money's worth with this device. It's solid, built to withstand the use it can be put through, and it is as attractive to look at on the outside as what's on the inside to power you through your days. It's a powerhouse next to other ""Budget"" phones, but no slouch when put up against the heavyweights.My pros: The fingerprint scanner works like a champion, always. The bonus use from it is very clever and really intuitive. The screen is amazingly vibrant and there are no defects or backlight issues to speak of. The body is wondrous. I can't believe I got all of this device and it's internals for just under $200. I am impressed beyond my expectations, and glad that I returned three other phones to get this one.My cons: I have to wait for another Honor device when the time comes to move beyond this device and further expand my knowledge and satisfaction. :-DNO NONSENSE.

Nice phone for the price,Really nice device. The 5.5 size is not too big and the screen is just right for someone like me who wears glasses which why i chose it. I gave it 4 stars because i've noticed a few issues. I've had this phone for about 3 weeks and it worked well until a few days ago when I noticed the volume on messages and incoming calls wouldn't turn off. It stayed like that for 2 days and is working again. Then sometimes it would automatically answer when someone calls even though its locked and i have to use a password or my finger to unlock it. It's usually on silent mode so i won't hear it ring but it will answer for itself and the person who calls will hear everything on my end but i'm unaware of the call. Finger print scanner is amazing thus far.

Good value for the price,"Switched from my older now slowing LG Optimus G Pro which was an amazing 5.5"" phone I got 3 years agoPros+ $185!!!I'm done paying $700-$800+ for phones. Whats the point really. You get 90% of features with Honor 5x which is great value if you factor cost in. Without, it is still an overall good phone+ Fingerprint sensor which is actually implemented well and smartly. I have diff fingerprints for diff functions - camera, unlock, call contact, launch app etc. Very slick and best part of phone. Phone unlocks in &lt; 0.5s. Apps launch in &lt; 0.5s+ Mostly smooth experience+ Octa core but hampered by 2GB RAM. Snapdragon 615 or whatever cpu is there is good enough+ good battery life (~30hrs normal use). Lasts me 2 days without charging. If it put it in the deep power save mode which makes it look like a cool Windows phone, it gets nearly 50hrs.+ worked with ATT and seems faster for LTE and seems to get better reception than LG Optimus G Pro I had before+ boots up quickly.+ worked without issue with LG G Watch+1920x1080 screen is good (2560x1440 would be great but not at this price). 4K is really waste of money tbh (I have 2 x 4K monitors and really - no games, no movies, no videos, nothing really make it all that diff than 1080p. SD -&gt; HD was insane leap which our eyes really saw. 1080p to 4K is now law of diminishing returns. Yes, there is a diff but quite tiny and really irrelevant.

Previously it was so east to hit the button to bring it to life.- EMUI is hit or miss. I think it looks very iPhone'ish but not quite and overall slickness is missing. Font choices are important and it is good but could've been better rendered- Screen doesn't have visual oomph- Occasional slight lag.- Average to poor camera quality - takes almost a sec to actually click the photo. Pics look noisy and grainy in low light and average in daylight. There's no real sharpness or fine definition to pics. They seem smudgy at times and just seem lower quality. LG Optimus G Pro took way better pics for same 13MP res (probably better sensor in camera). The HTC One I had was simply amazing here. iPhone 6s is also amazing if you like taking pics of family and want good quality.- front camera is average- camera pictures don't really pop. Colors seem muted and overall it seems very meh. Camera is likely where they cheapened outIf you looking for camera quality, this is probably something to consider- Poor camera built in choices - ""Good food"" picture setting made me chuckle- Missing IR Transmitter - I really loved by LG Optimus G Pro which allowed me to control my TV and Cable box with this.- Missing NFC but I didn't really care about this- Can't seem to customize what is shown on shortcuts screen or even make Notification or Shortcuts default.- Videos are of average quality- some settings from my LG phone are missing - like it follows my eyes and scrolls, keeps phone on if I'm looking at screen,- notification light not as good as my LG phone- 16GB built in is quite low. But considering Apple also does this stupidity, for this phone price doesn't seem as bad given iPhone is 3x costOverall, I'd rate this phone 8.5/10Definitely consider this if you need really good sub $200 phone. If your budget is say $250 or $300 or more, I think there's better choices.",2016年8月6日 在美国审核
Value smartphone(less than $200),"I bought this phone in 2016 and I still use this phone. This phone does not compete against flagship phones or even the high-end phones. Its a great cheap phone for &lt;$200. The camera on the phone can take okay photos and the battery life is great. There is some bloatware programs on the phone that does take up some storage space. The speakers on the phone are bad, but not terrible.I did buy glass screens and a protective cover for the phone.

"A really great phone that is easy to use, preserves battery power, and can take a lot of punishment.","I purchased this phone nearly a year ago as an emergency replacement for my Samsung Note 4 that was mid-contract and failing at an increasingly unacceptable pace.This phone does not offer all the things an expensive Samsung phone does &amp; I made fun of the fact I was carrying a Huawei phone for the first month or two I had it (still working with Samsung &amp; carrier to replace my defective Note 4).But, after a few months, and hearing outrageous replacement/repair fees on my warrantied phone, I realized Huawei had a high quality product.The Honor 5 surprised me many times over.The UI is as simple as you need it to be and flat out saves battery power - I eventually stopped bringing my charger to work.I've never owned a phone that could cut down all the background bs all these apps generate &amp; just retain power, especially when not in use.Also, in the past, I've had to always purchase a case to go with my phone or it was likely going to break.Every iPhone I've owned has had its glassed cracked or shattered.My Sony Xperia a few years back didn't break, but the glass chipped; same goes for my Nokia Lumia 1520.My Samsung didn't make it to the cracked screen stage because the phone killed itself via poor quality.My Huawei has hit the pavement face down well over a dozen times - it has not a scratch.My Huawei phone fell into a high Alkaline cleaning solution at work one day; I picked it out after a minute or so, wiped it off, and it still works perfect months later.I've soaked it with water countless times.I carry it everyday, I punish it everyday - it keeps on going.Given this phone saved me money &amp; has lasted, I intend in short time making my next phone a Huawei flagship, probably the Mate 9.The Honor 5, a phone I thought highly temporary, will still be in perfect condition &amp; will remain my backup phone.For those not wanting a flagship phone, rather a budget friendly phone that is reliable, it's hard to think of one better.",2017年6月10日 在美国审核
Updated Review..........,"After my LG G3 broke and I stilled owed AT&amp;T a few more months on my contract, I didn't want to get sucked in to a new contract with extra cost for 30 months. So I did a search for budget phones and this one kept popping-up on ""best of list"". I decided on the Huawei Honor 5x because of the metal body and fingerprint scanner.Well after three weeks I am very please with the phone. It has a very nice and bright display, very smooth going for app to app. I haven't had any issues with the GPS like some other reviews I've read. The camera is pretty good. And unlike some, I enjoy the features from the EMUI.I would give it 5 stars, but I can't seem to get any reply from Huawei about when they plan on updating to Android 6.0 Marshmellow.UPDATE:No update to Marshmallow. And Android N is about to be released...........I read somewhere the Google is cutting ties with Huawei because of there lack of updates.A big reason I bought this phone was becauseI saw a tweet by Honor that ""Marshmallow was coming soon"".I wish I would have gotten something else.",2016年5月13日 在美国审核
Great Value,"I read numerous technical reviews before purchasing and the phone certainly meets expectations. Phone will replace aging Samsung S III. Since retiring, I have greatly reduced need for a cell phone and did not want to pay $200+ for a new one. I did need a new one as I want to change from cdma to gsm service and the 5X appears to be a good choice. Limitation of not having NFC as mentioned in several reviews, is not critical as I do not use anyway.Key features I like are: finger print sensor, screen quality and performance. First negative I noticed is quality of speaker phone, it is understandable, but poor quality.Overall a great value for low priced phone.",2016年7月18日 在美国审核
Best you can get for $200,"I bought two of these new 5X' for my mother and father.I wanted them to have updated phones with decent specs and im glad I made this move.PROS: Price - $200Screen - 1080P LCD Goodness that is very vibrant and bright.Materials - A nice metal build that looks premium and feels good in the hand, not as good as HTC?Camera - very good performer for $200 , perfect for social media.Speaker - pretty loud for ringtones and mediocre for listening to music.Battery - 3000 mAh , enough for a day of normal use!Finger print scanner works very fluidCons - The phones would lag if I started to do heavy multitasking which included the opening of more than 4+ apps , and trying to move through the phone really fast.This is quite normal since we are dealing with a mid range CPU and 2GB ram.Overall the speed is quite sufficient if you aren't speeding through the phone.Misc - Some people may not enjoy the EMUI interface but I found it very nice!it was a breath of fresh air to experience versus the other major players' skins in the Android market",2016年2月20日 在美国审核

"Don't overthink, this phone is a very good deal! - Update: not so happy anymore...","I've been using this phone for a while now, so I feel like I can write a review. First of all, I love Apple products, but for my phone I prefer to have an Android device, not necessarily because one OS is better than the other, but pricewise they're more convenient. So, here's a short list of pros and cons:PROS:Very reactive, sometimes I use several apps at the same time and the phone doesn't glitch.Though I didn't buy this phone for the fingerprint recognition, I have to admit it's a very convenient feature and I use it all the time.I use the phone mainly fot texting, browsing the internet and reading/sharing content on different social media and the battery lasts a long time. Even when it reaches the lowest level, you can still rely on it for a short call.Memory is expandable: I bought a 64GB SD card and it works perfectly - I have all my music in it (more than 30GB), plus pictures and videos, and the phone never has a problem reading it.CONS:Quality of the call not the best, but who uses a phone like a phone anymore anyway?!?Covers and other accessories might be hard to find. I bought a cover here on Amazon, and it's doing ok (I dropped the phone just the other day and nothing happened!)I's a little bit bigger than I expected, so no way I can fit it in my pocketThe luminosity of the screen in bright light condition is not that effective.I'll update this review later in the year, and maybe add more details.UPDATE:I might have to ditch this phone soon, as after the last Android update its performances have been in constant decline. It freezes quite often now, the new Google interface slows it down annoyingly, and the few apps I have tend to crash (and I only use very few apps, like Facebook and Gmail). In other words, the user experience is now very, very frustrating.Even the wifi is now not that reliable: if I'm on a wifi call, I have to be careful how I move otherwise the phone loses the signal.One last thing: it might be just me and the way I hold the phone, but many times I don't even realize that I'm turning off the phone by holding the button. The problem is that it takes forever to turn it off and then turn it on again.",2016年7月7日 在美国审核

"Worth the Money, May Have Gripes if You Are Coming From a Higher End Phone Due to Slowdowns","I got this Honor 5x phone for use on my T-Mobile account.For people that are considering this phone, I want to emphasize that my review is based upon the experience of having used a Coolpad Rouge prior to this.If you are not familiar with this phone, it may be due to the fact that it is T-Mobile’s lowest priced SMARTPHONE (not a flip-phone) and one of the most economically priced out there period.And I got what I paid for ($10 special at Bestbuy), slow to the point that I press on the screen a second time thinking that the system didn’t register the first press when in actuality it doesn’t process fast enough and when it finally catches up, the second press will inadvertently open/close a page.The screen resolution is low, I squint at the screen due to its small size and clicks on the screen are not very precise, causing many typing errors.And logically, people that had the experience of a higher priced and quality phone may rate this lower.Although this is better than what I had,I will attempt to be as objective as possible with regards to the capabilities of this phone.The bottom line is that with regards to the price, it is a solid buy but heavier users beware of slowdowns and heating.If you found this helpful, please let me know!Hardware:I’m not going to repeat what can be read in the description but this phone is the best bang for the buck as far as hardware is concerned.Glass screen, metal alloy body, with a solid weight.The battery is not removable(unibody) and thus providing increased protection from water damage.It is a nice size as well with a 5.5” screen.There is also a fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone or apps and from what I’ve read, is harder to find at this pricepoint.Definite pluses in this area; this phone feels and looks like a phone that costs more. Its thin and sleek as well.The camera takes great pics and has a variety of features.Ultra sharp and clear. It includes various modes (food, beauty, selfie, etc) and various filter effects (vintage, mono, etc), images of various sizes, HDR/slow mo recording, and even “all-focus” to achieve the best quality picture.This is a Dual SIM phone for heavy users.The phone comes with a pointy key tool to pop out the SIM and micro-sd card compartments and was easy to use.User-Interface/Processing Speed:I had to return the first phone that I got due to constant overheating; to the point where the back of the phone is very warm 70%of the time.And of course this slows the phone down dramatically.I got a replacement, which didn’t overheat as much with the same amount of data used.The phone can get warm to the touch and slow down with multiple apps running esp video watching,download/uploading simultaneously. Possibly due to only having 2GB if RAM.I am only using 30% of internal memory storage and roughly 20% of my external sd card and 40% of the time, it warms up after 20 min of continual usage esp with a phone case.Not always a slowdown until I play videos with other apps running or dl/uploadwhile browsing.The phone’s internal ROM is 16GB which should be the minimum for a medium smartphone user.But it is generally acceptable.Huawei has its EMUI user-interface which is simplistic and fairly streamlined.The downside is that it constantly tries to revert customizations or 3rd party apps back to the stock EMUI interface.For example, I installed Arrow Launcher from Microsoft (the stock launcher and icons are unimpressive) and when I restart the phone, it will revert back to stock.For people that are used to a “faster” phone, the slowdowns will be a deal killer.Apps/Features:The fingerprint reader works but not efficient or precise enough for me to use as the method to unlock the phone.I find that it takes a few tries of pressing my index finger into the reader to get it to register.One neat feature is the storage cleaner to maintain faster processing speed; with the press of a button, it will clear out the cache and even app memory (reverting apps back to pre-update status) in both internal and external memory locations.I find it very convenient.Bloatware isn’t really an issue, there are a few apps preloaded (sound recorder, EMUI marketplace,) and could be useful.Battery Life:It's pretty good but then again I've only had it for less than a month.So far so good esp since its a 5.5"" screen.I keep my screen at the brightest setting and I can get through the day without plugging it in with moderate/heavy use. To give a better idea,I've been having a voice recorder and LTE Discovery running in the background all day and I have enough juice to last from 8am to 10pm withou plugging in.The charging wall adapter IS NOT 2.1 A and can be painstakingly slow to recharge.And the micro usb cable that comes with this is short… around 3 ft.First accesorry I got was a fast charging plug 2.1a usb port and 6 ft micro usb cable.I felt that this phone was worth the under $160 price-point but for those that have used higher end phones, the existence of slower processing and heating will be a point of frustration.I would purchase again if I had to do it over due to great hardware and tolerable functioning speed.",2017年1月29日 在美国审核
Good fingerprint sensor but ...,"I got this phone and used it for about 4 weeks before I decided to return it. Believe me, it is a hard decision. I mean, at the $200 price range, Honor 5X is a nice phone. The pros: good screen, metal body, and the most impressing thing about the phone, the fingerprint sensor. Some reviews mentioned about the EMUI, the customed andriod system. I am OK with the iOS -look of the EMUI. The cons, the camera is not really quick and sharp as it is described and after I only installed only one app, there was only about 10GB internal storage left and I got hiccups when switch between the apps. I know the Honor 5X is not a fancy flagship machine, but I do expect that it runs smoothly since I don't put a heavy load on it. I don't know it is the hardware or the software. And the biggest letdown is that dual sim feature because I do intent to use this feature. The problem is that only the 4G sim card can get a decent signal while another 2G card get weak and unstable signal reception. In my test, I get two sim card from the same carrier and the one on 2G mode constantly gets zero bars. I called the Honor support, one guy told me they did not hear such complaints and I might just get a lemon one and I should do an exchange. So, that is my experience with Honor 5X. In a summary, if you are not a heavy user for phone camera and you don't care dual sim, you should like the Honor 5X. Besides, the fingerprint sensor is really working very well.",2016年4月13日 在美国审核

Great Phone for No Contract Service,"Both my husband and I own an Honor 5X; he initially purchased on for me and after 10 minutes of playing around with it, purchased himself one.We are on no-contract service with an AT&amp;T MVNO and it was just a matter of swapping the SIM card and updating the APN info in the network settings.The phone is fast; it still hiccups on resource intensive tasks but overall is a huge leap forward from my outdated Galaxy S4 and a nice upgrade from the Alcatel Idol OneTouch 3 that my husband was using.Battery life is good, generally with light usage I can get 2 days before needing to charge.It has a fairly effective task killer built in, but you may want to ""protect"" apps that you use often so they do not terminate when the screen goes off, or you may use more battery re-loading the app over and over again coming out of sleep.Aesthetically this phone is fantastic, I would believe it was made by HTC if not for the branding.Screen is good, though the auto-brightness seems to glitch now and again and go fully dim when I need it to be bright.I just sleep, and then unlock again with fingerprint reader and it corrects itself; this takes maybe 2 seconds.The EMUI software may be nice for some, I immediately replaced it with Google Now launcher.The cameras are great for a budget phone, not amazing compared to phones that closer to 4 digits.Overall, I am pleased, but I won't be throwing away my DSLR anytime soon.In summary, this is a good budget phone and I would recommend it for AT&amp;T MVNOs or prepaid over anything they are offering in store today.",2016年2月28日 在美国审核
Yuge disappointment,"Wow!Never have I experienced so many problems in such a short period of time.I cannot even properly express the magnitude to which this phone disappoints.First, do not try to do anything with it connected to a charging cable, or for that matter a speaker/earbud cable as this simple act alone will flake out the interface.Further, the sdcard is easily ""damaged"" by which I mean it's functioning fine and all of a sudden is ""damaged"" according to the OS.Then there's the issue of not rebooting before practically every task switch.If you had it on overnight and checked email you're probably fine.Ask it to play a locally stored (damaged sd card again) video, and just plan on rebooting it or having your video freeze and stop responding.Or maybe you lie your touch screen to be responsive, well don't plan on it with this unit.It's worse that what I replaced with it.I'd love to go back and save myself the hassle.On the positive side, it's inexpensive as these devices go, but all things considered I still feel as though I've been taken having bought this cheap junk.

The modified Android 5.1 is very easy and swift, but looks a lot like iOS. If it came with, or upgraded to Android 6, I would give it 5 stars!",2016年3月9日 在美国审核
Great combination of quality and price,"Giving this phone 5 stars for what seems to be a fantastic combination of quality and price.Now I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 so I am used to having good processors and an all around very zippy,high quality device and I must say that for $200, Huawei has impressed me. This phone is not for the extreme phone user who has 20 background processes and 5 games running at the same time obviously because the RAM is limited and the processor is not as good as the flagships,HOWEVER,if you need a good phone for daily usage,checking emails, the occasional game or two and general web surfing/social media and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket,well this is the phone for you.Pros: Very well designed, relatively fast responsetime (for general usage), finger print scanner (which allows you to get straight into the device from screen off &lt;3) bright display and good screen resolution.Cons: EMUI and the built in launcher. Camera quality is not the best for 13 mpix.The operating system was manageable once I downloaded google now and had an app drawer I was used to,but I am definitely not a fan of the EMUI design.It looks like an over-simplified ios/android hybrid and makes the icons look like a 2 yr old's doodles.Not impressed. However,it's not a deal-breaker for me since the phone has other very good qualities to overcome this and also the beauty of Android is that I could always root the phone and change it if I don't like it. The camera is just low-quality.It takes ok photos to show friends,upload and such but not as crisp and clear as other 13 mpixs I have used (however once again this is a $200 phone so considering that it's already impressive enough).Now all I need to see it how well the phone lasts the test of time. :D.",2016年7月11日 在美国审核

Huawei Screws Up,"EMUI v4.0 - the stock launcher from Huawei, places an updater on your phone that cannot be shut off, removed or blocked without rooting the phone. Which is completely inappropriate: why would I be buying an unlocked phone if i wanted auto-updating on my personal property? Avoiding exactly this BS is why I don't buy phones through my carrier.Addendum - three months later: Should you buy this phone DO NOT use any of Huawei's apps. These are literally the poorest examples of programming I've ever seen....And my career spanned 20 years as a programmer and then IT Director. I ran out of space on my internal memory and the Huawei app that deletes unnecessary files popped up and started going through my 16 gigs of internal memory AND 64 gigs of SD card - which was a waste of my time so I backed out of it with the system back-arrow. When I did that, the program just deleted a folder of videos without asking me....Not toast....Nothing. Just gone.That's simply incompetent.",2017年3月6日 在美国审核

"Make no mistake, this is a budget phone","You get what you pay for here. The phone's build quality is solid, screen resolution is nice. Unfortunately the stock EMUI is pretty unintuitive and resource-intensive, so I recommend using a Google launcher or just flashing a more streamlined rom. Otherwise you'll be dealing with a lot of lag as the processor struggles to keep up with multiple apps, even things as simple as playing music while searching maps. This phone definitely makes you a more patient person as you will have to wait a few seconds when opening most apps and using the browser.The trade-off is that the battery life is excellent, Even with wifi/4g/bluetooth on, I won't have to charge for 2 days with regular usage.",2017年2月6日 在美国审核

"Good phone, but needs better optimization.","I've owned the Honor 5X for about 7 months now. I've been mostly happy with the phone because the price was very good at the time for a phone with these specs and a fingerprint reader. Right now, I think it's better for budget users to pay a little more and wait for a sale on the LG Nexus 5X, which has a better CPU and very timely software updates directly from Google. The Nexus 5X seems to go on sale every other week on Amazon and various sites. However, if you want to save every dollar that you can while getting decent specs, this is still not a bad phone to purchase.I really like the hardware on the Honor 5X. The phone itself is slim and feels good in the hands, yet has a decent battery size for the price (the battery life is about 4-6 hours screen-on time depending on usage). I love the screen. It looks sharp and crisp, especially when you get a nice high resolution wallpaper for your homescreen. It can get very bright when needed. Viewing angles are good, not great. But I almost always look at the screen directly head-on, so that's not a problem. Call quality is good.Fingerprint reader works fast. There is a micro-SD card slot and dual-SIM slot, which is hard to find in phones sold in North America. The camera is okay. 15% of the time it takes photos that I can't believe were taken using a $200 phone, while the other 85% of the time, the photos don't look that good and will require me to use ""auto-fix"" in a photo editing program to make the photo colors and lighting look more realistic to real-life.Despite the mediocre camera, I would give the hardware 5 stars for the price. What holds the phone back from 5 stars overall is the software. Huawei's EMUI skin visually looks fine to me. Some people say it looks ugly, but I like the way it looks. And it has some nice features. What bothers me about it is that it's optimized too much in favor of trying to preserve battery life, even after you go into the battery menu and change it to ""performance"" mode. 4 weeks ago, I suddenly started to get so frustrated with the sluggishness of the Honor 5X. Upgrading the phone to Android Marshmallow and doing a factory reset didn't help very much.It drove me insane, to the point where I decided it was worth the risk to most likely void my warranty and install a custom ROM.Some people also point to the Snapdragon 616 CPU for the performance issues, but after installing a custom ROM on the Honor 5X, I think the 616 is capable of good performance in 90% of the non-game apps you'll install. With a good custom ROM, such as CyanogenMod 13, most apps will load just about instantly (most games will take some time to load but they will load faster when compared to the Stock Huawei ROM), scrolling performance will be greatly improved, and games will be a little more smooth overall. I am so happy I decided to install a custom ROM. Before, I really couldn't wait for the 2016 Nexus phones to be released so I could buy that to replace my Honor 5X, but it now feels like I can keep the phone another 6 months.If only Huawei cared more about operating system performance, this phone would easily be 5 stars for me. I know they have to make compromises with hardware at this price, but with the software, the degree of compromise is far, far lower. They could have still optimized it better without ruining their profit margins. Hopefully Huawei figures it out before they release their next phone in North America.",2016年8月1日 在美国审核

This phone is so much better than the P8 Lite,"I purchased this after my Huawei P8 Lite frustrations with capacity got too much to handle.I needed a phone with dual sims AND expandable memory, which the P8 did not have, you had to choose dual sims or extra memory via MicroSD.This phone is so much better than the P8 Lite.It is much more responsive with much less lag.The screen and overall build of the device is also tightened up and feels better.The larger screen takes some getting used to, but isn't too big and having a larger battery is the most beneficial part of the Honor 5x.It would be more ideal if internal storage was 32GB, since you can fill up the 16GB pretty quickly even with the additional MicroSD card since you can't move all apps to the additional storage.I am hoping that the Marshmallow update is release and allows extension of the internal storage to avoid this issue. The fingerprint reader is also very convenient, it is super fast and the gesture support is also handy using it to control items.It also has double tap to wake which I missed from my Nokia Windows Phone days, it makes turning it on very handy when on a table.I wasn't aware it came with a screen protector installed, but it is pretty nice, not like the latest glass protectors, but good enough to start.I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this device, it meets all my needs and performs elegantly, bravo to Huawei building such nice devices at reasonable price points.I know the camera isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done at the price point and isn't my main use of the device.Newer models have better cameras if you are interested in that area.

Loving this phone!!!!!!!!,This phone is amazing. My first time using the brand Huawei and i must say the quality is amazing. There is no lag and ive had this phone for a bit an i tend to do alot of different things at once. The fingerprint scanner can be used to lock apps in addition to being the phones main lock it can also be used as the shutter button and for someone who loves taking pictures including selfies thats beyond amazing. The picture quality is definitely more than i expected especially for the price. Simply put im more than happy with this product an would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable phone with great quality all around.,2017年1月28日 在美国审核
But it works well enough for me and would be an excellent entry level or stop gap,"I have this now for about 6 months and it works well daily. I would consider myself a mid range user and it handles itself well for the most part. Occasionally it gets really slow and lags a bit. When that happens, I usually just restart the phone or use the pre-installed 'phone manager' to clean up the RAM etc. I do not know if it is the phone or the combination with the case or my network where I live, but I also often get a complete drop out of all signal which can be an issue. But as I said, I don't know if I can place all the blame on the phone. But it works well enough for me and would be an excellent entry level or stop gap phones",2017年2月4日 在美国审核

Half of a Flagship Phone for a Third of the Price,"I bought this phone when my old one died on me and wanted to get through the end of my contract. I have had this phone now for 9 months and I can safely say that it really has held up quite well. This phone is exactly what you are paying for. This phone has run all of my essential functions with ease. The two things that keep this separated from the $700 phones are the camera and processor. The camera takes okay pictures, which is fine for me. The phone will slow down if I try to use too many apps at once or use a more intensive one. For me, these are two things that I would be willing to sacrifice on a phone. It runs all of my basic needs no problem, such as Facebook, Instagram, and most games with ease. I bought this phone for $200 and definitely feel like I got my money's worth out of it. I'm planning on using this for another 6 months if I can before I upgrade. If you are looking at this, I would definitely recommend this phone for the budget minded person. If the Honor 6x (the newer version) is anything similar to this, I would recommend that as well. Will update if/when this phone dies on me.",2017年2月19日 在美国审核

The best kept smartphone secret.,"I got this phone in November 2016 so as of this review I have been using it for over 8 months.I use it daily and recharge it every night.I chose this phone after doing a month of research on what was out there for a reasonable price.I'm not about to spend 500+ on the latest and greatest phone.My husband always has an up to date iPhone from his job so I had one of the high end phones for comparison.I looked at many other phones, even the better spec Honor 8, but I really dislike the plastic construction of most phones.I will say that Apple wins pretty much every durability test out there and having had several iPads and iPhones over the years, I've done several of those tests myself so I know what I'm looking for in durability.I wanted something more solid and metal is an excellent material due to it's flexibility.It will bend but not shatter.It doesn't get fatigued from temperature or sun like plastic.It's amazing how few phones and tablets use metal. I have dropped my Honor a few times, and thus far, it's only got a tiny scratch on the back.It's durable and since I keep my electronics until they hit either obsolescence or are irrevocably damaged, that's a big issue for me.After looking at reviews and spending some time in a Best buy playing with phones, the 5x stood out, even against some 'better' more expensive phones.The 200 dollar price tag is right on target.You can't find a better phone for this price in my opinion.The construction is solid, the OS is fast and has given me very few problems.The few hiccups I've had were fixed with a quick reboot which isn't surprising considering it has been on almost non-stop since I got it.I had zero issues transferring my cellular service (T-Mobile) to this phone from my old android phone that bit the big one.(I don't bother getting phones every year or two, I buy one and use it until it is no longer viable.)The screen is large, clear, bright and colorful.It is surprisingly light for its size.I bought a 128G sd card when I bought this and installed that immediately.I've got music, audio books, podcasts, videos and pictures on this thing and I'm not even close to running out of room.I have been using a blue-tooth headset with it for a few months now and it hasn't had any noticeable effect on my battery life.Speaking of battery life, I am savy enough to know how to keep apps turned off and how to keep my protected app list short.Thus far in one day the lowest I've gotten my battery is 40% and that was after playing some Pokemon go on it, which will run anything down.I know some people don't like the native UI this phone comes with, but I have zero issues with it.Maybe it's becasue I have an iPad, but its easy enough to use and familiar.I haven't had any performance issues with it at all and while I tried a few other UIs, I went back to the native UI becasue I like the familiar look and feel of it and it was most similar to my old android phone.(That tells you how old THAT phone was.)It performs as well as the iPhone 5 in every measure and as well as the base iPhone 6 in some things.It's a good deal at this price.I would recommend going to a store that carried these and playing around with it to get a feel for the phone.If you are in the market for a modern smart phone but don't want to pay seven arms and five legs, this is the best budget phone on the market.",2017年8月18日 在美国审核

The price is right but that's about it.,"This phone is hands down one of the worst Android phones I've ever had, I didn't expect to be blown away because this phone clearly costs less than a lot of other smart phones on the market right now. However I've had numerous issues with this phone first and foremost the constant lagging of this phone is awful and it makes this phone barely usable, several times (more then I can count) if I try to make a phone call I'll type in the number or launch a call from my contact list and the phone will not even dial the number for several minutes if at all, on one occasion I tried to make a phone call and it started actually making the call two minutes later and I couldn't even respond to the person on the other end because of this issue, I have remedied this issue by rooting my phone and constantly running fstrim on a schedule to help keep things a little faster I've also disable the swap partition on this phone which helps some but I still end up needing to reboot this awful phone at least twice per day.My other issue with this phone is that now there is a random blue spot on my display that really only appears if I'm looking at something that's dark (example: a webpage or app with a black background), this spot does not go away and appears to be a hardware defect.",2016年11月25日 在美国审核

Lags even with basic use and Bends easily,"I bought this device roughly 50 days ago. I was impressed with the quality delivered at the listed price and found set-up and customization easy. The device feels great in my hands and I am very impressed with the speed and accuracy of the fingerprint scanner. In regards to the camera, the selfie camera is mediocre, but the camera on the back works extremely well for video - not so much for pictures. Now on to some issues...When reading reviews, I was concerned with the number of sources that stated that the device lags. I thought to myself, ""I don't use apps, I just call and text and maybe take an occasional picture - I don't need some hardcore processor"". Well, I was mistaken apparently. The device often takes several seconds to respond to me pressing a button and texts that have already been received often take time to load one-by-one.Furthermore, the device began bending - not to a degree that I couldn't use it, but it is certainly noticeable. I contacted Huawei and they told me that the phone may bend if placed in your pocket (even though I ONLY place the device in my front pocket). I feel as though an experienced firm would make the reasonable assumption that their phones should be able to withstand being in a pocket, or at least notify consumers otherwise.",2016年8月1日 在美国审核

but for the price they are easily overlooked. Camera,"For $200, this phone is a steal. Sure, it has some drawbacks, but for the price they are easily overlooked.Camera: The camera quality is mediocre at best. Pictures tend to have poor contrast and are over-sharpened. HOWEVER! The camera is very, very quick. It focuses very fast, and takes a picture almost instantly. This is a redeeming aspect of the camera, as most phones, especially cheap phones, have a camera that is exceptionally slow.Build quality: Build is very solid. The metal back feels nice in the hand, and it feels very sturdy.Fingerprint sensor: The fingerprint sensor is phenomenal, it is very quick and works at any angle.Battery: Battery life is very good. I am not a heavy user, but I easily have 60% battery left at the end of the day.Performance: Performance is good, but not noteworthy. By default, it has a ""battery saver"" mode enabled, which makes it very slow and laggy (this is probably the reason why some of the reviews say it is laggy). Disabling it improves performance, and makes the phone very smooth. Games that aren't 3d run well.To top it off, the phone has dual sim slots + micro SD, which is something even the latest flagship phones seem to be leaving out.",2016年3月12日 在美国审核

On occasions, my kids will use it to play games and even after 1-2 hours it will hold a good charge until I go to sleep.Phone hasn't heat up, or lagged when operating. Feels sturdy.

I came from a high end windows phone which had a very fluid UI and a good web browsing experience,"This phone is very slow. I came from a high end windows phone which had a very fluid UI and a good web browsing experience. This phone is just so slow. I have to wait for everything. I'm not just talking about waiting for a moment, but waiting for like 5-10 seconds. Open the messaging app to send a test to my wife, wait 5 seconds for the app to load. Tap the message string to reply on, wait 3 seconds for the messages to load. Tap the text input area, wait 3-5 seconds for the keyboard to load. Even typing is slow on this phone. I didn't realize how much of a problem I had until I picked up an old $30 windows phone I bought a few years ago and realized how fast that phone is. I watched a friend use their iPhone a few days ago and I couldn't believe how fast they were able to do things like send a text message. I REALLY like the fingerprint reader. It is very fast and much better than the one on my wife's Sony phone. This thing is really slow though.

"For the price, it's a no-brainer.","Was really looking to pick up a phone with a fingerprint sensor and given the price of this product, ( $125 on Prime Day ) it was really the obvious choice. I immediately upgraded to EMUI 4.0/Marshmallow, which is great.Positives:1) Fingerprint scanner is accurate and fast - Speed is always good, if you put your finger on the scanner at an angle as you might when 1-handing this device it has trouble reading the tip/sides of your finger for obvious reasons. Usually quickly shifting your finger even slightly makes it read, usually even before the 'not found fingerprint' alert goes away. Really impressive though and I wouldn't fault it for not being able to read the tip of a finger, after all it has to see the fingerprint to read it.2) Screen is nice, wanted an OLED but this screen is nice and sharp.3) Buttons are nice and tactile, dual sim and microsd are a very nice feature. I can't believe all phones don't have this.4) Has nice gesture features, swiping down on touch pad, one hand mode with slide on buttons, drawing letters for applications even with the phone off, using touchpad to answer calls, flipping phone to mute. ( Just generally nice usability features. )Negatives:1) No USB-C, really would have been nice, but again, for the price I'm not faulting it.2) Speaker is questionable, meager sound quality and easily blocked - bottom firing. But, I guess it's a phone and not a boom box, so a good speaker isn't that important. ( At least to me )3) Can't use fingerprint and pattern unlock for some reason...when your phone is on the table, being able to use a pattern unlock would be nice. For some reason it requires you to use pin codes while fingerprint is on.4) Default screen protector is a fingerprint magnet, get a new one ASAP, possibly worse than nothing.5) Wish itwas plainer android. Comes with only a single theme with the new version of EMUI 4.0.So, it does have a few negatives that distinguish it from a flagship device but given the substantial price differences these negatives can be easily ignored for most uses.6) Isn't super snappy, but it's not bad. Again, for the price, can't fault it.",2016年7月16日 在美国审核

Try to use a GPS app for driving directions: restarts every single time I try to open it. The phone gets disturbingly hot when attempting to 'stream' any kind of media or GPS data. I wanted to like this phone because it looks great and was relatively inexpensive compared to iphones and galaxy phones,but it is not really useful as anything other than a calling and texting (And even then it still receives those 'at will' and will restart itself if I try to listen to voicemails) device because it can't handle anything more processor-intensive.

Perfect budget phone waiting to be Flashed,"This is a great phone whose potential is waiting to be unlocked for those willing to root and flash the phone.If you like the stock UI, thats cool, but it just wasn't for me.It was a little too buggy and a little too apple-y for me.To fix this, I originally did the NovaLauncher trick, but the phone still lagged every so often.In comes rooting and flashing the phone...I did the twrp root with the Resurrection Remix ROM.Now the phone is aaaaamazing!!!By flashing to this new ROM, I now have a more basic/stock android experience/UI with many added features that do not bog the system down.I can maintain an up to date android version, currently running Marshmallow, at a faster pace than the manufacturer is able to release such updates. The only downside of doing this is that you lose the ability to use the fingerprint scanner for now. A quick google search of: rootong honor 5x, will set you in the right direction.As far as hardware goes, everything is awesome.The camera is pretty solid at taking good pictures when I take them, usually during the day in good lighting conditions.Originally I was skeptically about the ""large"" screen size as I was coming from the Iphone 5s, but the larger screen produces a much more pleasant user experience(less eye strain, easier to manipulate the touch screen, etc...).The fingerprint scanner was very quick, albeit there would be rare occasions where the phone just refused to identify my finger as belonging me who was the registered user of the phone.The casing and build of the phone seem solid.I always use a phone case in conjunction with a glass screen protector and I have not had any problems as far as quality control go.Overall, this is a great budget phone as is, perfect for kids/teens who, in my opinion, most definitely do not need a new flagship phone every 7 months. And for adults who don't need the Iphone or galaxy gimmick, this is a very capable phone once it is rooted and flashed with new ROM.",2016年6月30日 在美国审核

Works perfectly with my old T-mobile micro SIM card,"I was looking for a decent upgrade for my older LG phone, and wanted one that would fit the T-mobile micro SIM card from my old phone, so I could just pop it in and use it. This phone brilliantly has two SIM slots so it will fit a micro and/or a nano SIM!I also like the design, features and speed, and since it is unlocked, most apps can be disabled if you don't want them draining battery power and taking up storage space.One feature I especially like is the blinking notification light on the front- so you can tell at a glance when you missed a call, text or app notification- many phones don't have this feature, my old one had it- and I know I would miss it if my new phone didn't.I had to do a software update when I first turned the phone on, took about an hour.

Honor 5X vs Nexus 5X and why the Honor 5X is 2 Stars,"Dont' buy into the hype of this phone. Sure, it feels and looks like an iPhone. However, the processing speeds are ridiculously slow. I recently purchased a Nexus 5X. I've found the phone at nearly the same price.The Nexus 5X shoots 4k video and DNG raw photos. It's literally an entire generation newer with respects to its camera. The processing speeds, even though it's a 6 core instead of an 8-core, are nearly twice as fast at every day tasks! I can hardly believe how slow the Honor 5X is in comparison.With all do respect to the order of my purchase and the reality that I've been dealt, I was so glad to have the Honor 5X. I did have the Honor 5X first. But, if I didn't have the Nexus 5X, I would have never of known that the Honor 5X is not worth any where near what it's being held up to and/or the cost that it currently holds.All that aside, it's easy to say that I don't like it because of the Nexus 5X.

I like the fact that you can choose between the regular layout and the ""simplified"" screen. The phone also looks much more expensive than $199, more like a Samsung.

Stuck on Huawei now.,"Just as a reference, I'm coming from a Samsung Galaxy Light which is about the lowest of the low when it comes to budget phones being priced at $100 when I got it. I simply adore this phone. Huawei really knew what they were when they made this phone. The screen is so clear and I have received so many compliments on the screen and camera. It is much easier to take pictures of checks to make mobile deposits than it was on my Samsung. The front facing camera is also very clear and the settings only add more bang for your buck.On the note of the processor and RAM, I just can't seem to slow this phone down no matter what I do. I'm not an avid phone gamer but I've had 7+ apps running and it still runs like a dream. 2 gigs of RAM is pretty standard and doesn't seem like much but I haven't overloaded it yet (it tells you how much is free in the recent apps menu).Battery life is much better than my Samsung even though I constantly listened to music through Spotify on both, the 5X sports a 3000 mAh battery and has some nifty features where it will monitor and warn you about power intensive apps as well as manage processing power and brightness to lengthen the run time on a single charge. Never use optimize function though.Fingerprint sensor is what attracted me so much to this phone other than price point as you really don't see this on phones priced at only $200. The reaction speed is very fast and convenient with the gestures feature and tasks that can be assigned be assigned to different fingers. My only problem is that it won't read your fingerprint if it is wet (I work in an environment where my hands are constantly in and out of water) and sometimes it doesn't read the finger correctly.Finally, the UI. Doesn't have the latest Android OS but I honestly don't care. The Emotion UI gets a lot of flack from people and they immediately download a launcher to get an app drawer. I have had both an android (for phone calls) and Apple (Ipod Touch for music before I got Spotify) so I really like the mixing of Android and iOS in this UI and became acclimated very easily.I love my new phone and hope that they bring high end phones as well to the US market because the Honor 7 has my name written all over it.",2016年3月21日 在美国审核

A Challenging Phone for People Who Like Challenges,"Those of us who have lucked into discovering the Honor 5X are fortunate that Huawei has jumped into the American market with a big splash. There seems to be little doubt, to me at least, that this is a top-drawer, quality phone that has been deeply discounted to both attract a consumer user base and draw the rave reviews it is presently receiving. The absence of commonly complained about features like NFC, a USB-C charger, a slightly outmoded processor and the like are just enough to keep the phone within the mid-range pricing category but not enough to dismiss all the other attributes that make this an outstanding phone as well as an outstanding bargain.Although most of the hoopla has centered around the superlative fingerprint scanner and the quality 1080p screen, I think the real build quality of the phone lies in its lesser, standard features like the FM radio, Mp3 music and MP4 video player, along with the excellent built-in flashlight, calculator and calendar. The FM radio, for example, is stronger and cleaner than the transmitter on both the Sony Walkman cassette player and the Xperia M that I own. Ditto for the MP3 player. And with an SD card (I'm hanging with a 64gb right now) you can have a film library of at least 30 on board movies at your fingertips that run crisply and cleanly on the 1080p screen. All in all, it's an impressive media experience.Some sissy reviewers have complained about the default Emotion UI, but that seems to be because they want the perfect immediate experience and they despise when they aren't instantly gratified. But if you tinker with the EMUI and you kind of see what Huawei is getting at, and anticipate where the may be headed with its development, you can kind of sense that it isn't all that problematical. I, for one, don't see the need for either a third-party launcher or an app drawer. But then again, I've never owned an iPhone so this UI looks pretty fresh to me. What I am especially finding intriguing and enjoyable is playing with and tweaking and finding ways to make EMUI compatible with my visual aesthetic, which mostly consists of viewing the many different themes available on Huawei's website and selecting the best one.I haven't tried the highly touted and versatile fingerprint scanner since the very cool double-tap feature suits me just fine for now. That, and all the other features of this phone, will likely implemented in due course. But for now, discovering all the things this phone can do has been interesting and fun.",2016年3月7日 在美国审核

It's just OK,"I needed a phone to handle 2 SIM cards because I wanted to combine my work and personal phones into one. After much research, this seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately there are very few dual SIM choices for the US market. Pros: metal back, fingerprint sensor, dual SIM.Even before I bought it I wasn't thrilled about the huge 5.5 inch size and I was right. It is hard to maneuver by one hand. Not only that but there's quite a bit of black bezel which takes up screen space anyway. EMUI isn't that great even though they've tried to emulate iOS. No app drawer either so I had to install Google's app. Processor/RAM speed are meh. No Gorilla glass that's why they already ship it with some kind of screen protector. I bought my own protector anyway.Battery life isn't that good. It has Snapdragon processor but no Quick Charge. In the very beginning, after charging it completely and going to bed with no apps running, it would lose 2% on its own while sleeping (7 hours). Now it loses 4% after 3-4 hours!

I was a really nice surprise that I loved this phone,"I actually bought this phone with no expectations at all, but for my surprise it it actually a really nice device. I had an iPhone before someone stole it and thought I wouldn't find a nice cheap phone to replace it in the mean time.I found there was an offer, and just clicked on Buy, and by the time it was on my hands I just hoped for the best.At first I thought 'Wow, this is really big phone', but once I got used to it, I really liked it. It has a nice alumium finish on the back that makes it look elegant.The fingerprint sensor works perfectly, and has other functionalities than just unlock the phone, I can control the camera, the notification panel, etc...I though,'well, it's brand new now, maybe when I download some apps and stuff It starts lagging or having problems', but not at all, I have it now for like 2 month with all the apps I need, and no problems at all, it works really fast.Other cool spec is the 2 sim Cards slots and the sd slot... I really missed having the freedom to expand the memory when I want, without having to buy a new phone.Battery is never ending, I'm not actually someone who uses the phone 24 hours intensively, like for games or that kind of things. Just regular use, calls, messaging, Social networks, News, Music, Word,Excel,Mail, Browsers, etc. with 4G always on, or Wi-Fi. For a regular day, by the time I arrive home I still have 70% of the battery, after like 10 hours away.(Obviously it depends on what I do that day) ...The only thing I'm not really happy about, is the camera, it doesn't have the best quality, sometimes photos are moved, or not focused. If you take your time, you'll have a nice photo, but if you want to take a quick photo, it's not that good. Usually photos taken by this phone have some noise... If you expect the iPhone camera on this device, it's not for you... But don't forget it's a 200 usd phone, photos are not terrible, just regular, let's say it's not it's best specification.I've noticed some people compaint about the EMUI software, I don't think it's terrible, or perfect, it just there, neutral. If you don't like it you can always download another launcher, but I had no problems with it yet.So, there are some of my thoughts... I really like this phone, and I really like the price of course, you can have everything you need for a good price, nothing to envy to other more expensive phones. I'm really happy with it, and I'm staying with it because it works great, and I really like it, it doesn't make me miss my iPhone that much.I even bought my mom one of this phones and she likes it too.",2016年4月17日 在美国审核

Can't Go Wrong With It.,"I got the phone today.I'm not going to tell you too much about the sophisticated build quality because enough has been posted on Amazon and YouTube. Feel free to read and watch. This review is my 1st day personal user experience. I also have to mention that this phone is unique in the sense that it is ONLY $200 and i'll be mentioning the price point frequently in my review.T-Mobile SIM card and 64 gig Micro SD card went in without any trouble. 4G/LTE on T-Mobile is flawless. And Yes confirmed, NO BAND 12.Phone powered and booted without any problems, Setup was a breeze. Screen quality is excellent, colors, brightness and viewing angles satisfactory considering the price point. Absolutely NO bloatware (Excellent Job Honor).Uninstalled two apps Facebook and Shazam without any trouble.The device lagged a few places initially when I was uninstalling apps I don't use and installing apps that I do.Lag is minimum and non-significant. You might experience some lag when you reboot the device and as you continue to use apps and network, lagging gets better. Not any different than my nexus 6 or my wife's iPhone 6+.The phone is very snappy and screen is very responsive. Changed the power setting to normal and added some more protected apps to run when the sreen is off as suggested by reviewers. Sound is above average and satisfactory considering the price point. Video quality is excellent. Finger print sensor is the winner and setting up finger print was easy and quick.Finally EMUI. The answer is ""it is different"". It is not bad, Just different. I actually like the different look and feel of the EMUI. It takes a little getting used to but nothing that you can't adjust to in a matter of a few hours. No fast charging but I used a different charger and was able to charge it completely in 1.5 hours. I think the original charger is slow. No NFC, but oh well. You still Can't Go Wrong With It considering the price.Lets be honest. For $200 bucks this device is a steal and can easily be used as your daily driver. Unlocked without any contract and no monthly payments makes you a winner in every way. Pick it up and you wont regret.Will Update Battery Life in a few days.",2016年2月3日 在美国审核

Even after applying all the settings to protect specific apps and modifying the power feature, it would still turn off some apps (Life360--which *must* stay running). The bluetooth didn't work with my son's bluetooth headphones.

Very Happy With Purchase,"Very nice phone, especially for the price. It was super easy to set up and this is coming from someone who hasn't had a new phone in 5 years. The first thing I did was insert my SIM card (T-Mobile) and a new 32GB SDHC card. This was accomplished by using the included tool to open the slots. Then I charged the phone completely. When I turned the phone on, it booted up fast. I was worried it would be a big hassle to replace all my apps but it went pretty well. I like the ability to customize this phone to my liking. It's easy to use and I was up and running right away. The sound quality is good and I like the auto-bright screen feature.I had no trouble going from my old phone (Samsung S2) to the Honor 5X and that was my biggest concern. I paired the phone with the Huawei Honor 5x Case (Black) and the phone looks really slick! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AQI8VBA?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00The phone is great looking and seems really well made.

Now, I am not the one who can tell you all about the specs on this phone, neither am I an expert on software; however I can say that this is the slickest, fastest, most efficient, user friendly, feel good in my hand phone I've ever had.The battery time on this phone is freakishly long.

I am so glad I chose this phone.The only 2 CONS about the phone:1. I don't like the little key to get to the sim card.2. Can't remove the battery.The cons are not enough for me to NOT recommend this phone. I highly recommend. I love it!This review is given by Kathy.",2017年2月6日 在美国审核

I really wanted this phone to work well,"Sigh...I had to return it. The phone is very nice, has a beautiful clear crisp screen resolution, it's light and has a shiny metal back. It has a high-end look and feel with many great features. Excellent camera. The screen is actually a 5"" rather than 5.5"", as the home buttons are on the actual screen rather than on the frame of the phone. So your actual browsing window is smaller. But there were real problems: right away the most annoying thing was the auto brightness that could not be disabled. The screen was dim every time the phone was awaken, and I had to disable the auto brightness (which was not bright at all), only for it to revert to auto the next time. I had to download an app that controlled screen brightness. But I could have lived with it. The critical part was Bluetooth that kept turning itself off at random throughout the day. Sometimes it turned itself off after just a few minutes, other times after an hour or two. It did not disconnect from a particular device (so you may think it's the device's fault) but rather Bluetooth was inexplicably OFF! Having the phone connected by Bluetooth to my VTech cordless home phone is essential, as I have no land line and only rely on cell phone with steady bluetooth connection. I wish it didn't have that problem, as I really wanted to keep it.",2016年3月2日 在美国审核

The Back gets scratched easily The Positives,Before I review the phone it is important to remember that this is a budget phone. That being said the reason I rated it low is:1. It lags a lot when I use it to play music on my car (Bluetooth) and Google Maps Simultaneously. I tried changing the launcher as suggested online to make up for the laggy EMUI software and even then the phone is slow.2. It occasionally hangs and struggles to do the most basic of browsing tasks.3. There is a function which monitors the power usage of the apps and you will have to disable this to prevent it from continuously popping up for each app.4. The Back gets scratched easilyThe Positives:1. The feel of the phone is really good with the sleek metal back.2. Looks real good for a cheap phone.3. The Fingerprint sensor is really responsiveOverall I would not suggest this phone for people who are big fans of multitasking. For othergeneral purposes it is a decent phone!,2016年12月15日 在美国审核

Great Except the Screen Protector,"I actually love my new smart phone (5 stars), but there is one issue that marks it down to four stars, i.e., the screen protector (see para 3 below).The Good: I started personalizing the phone right away and was able to put my old sim card ($100 a year GoPhone) into it after I trimmed the sim down.Hurrah!!! Also quickly and easily linked up to my WIFI network, which I intend to use for internet for the time being until I see how much I want to use data on the new phone.That probably sounds crazy to those addicted to their smart phones for everything, but for someone who only occasionally used her flip phone, it's a logical first step that doesn't require a big investment (just the new phone).I'm thrilled with how easy it is to text and, since I have over $300 of unused talk/text minutes, the fact it costs a lot for each text doesn't matter to me -- they are free since they just use my rollover balances. The fingerprint sensor is great (I took some online advice and registered as many fingers as the phone would allow) and the latest software update (which I did as soon as I linked to WIFI) is quick and gives you a screen similar to other Android devices (apparently the Honor 5X used to show something else).I was also able to download a detailed users manual for the Honor 5X and am walking my way through it as I learn my new phone.Other than the fact the manual doesn't tell me to double tap to save my choice of wallpaper (I single tapped numerous times and failed before thinking of that), the instructions are clear and helpful.I also linked the phone to my car after a couple of false starts (had forgotten I needed to make the phone blue tooth visible, which is under settings, and which I did on my last phone four years ago, so had forgotten).That's my fault, not the phone's, and it worked easily once I made it visible.Getting back to the screen protector, after using the phone for a few minutes the screen was covered in my fingerprints.I tried wiping them off and they tended to smear and were really hard to remove.I looked online and learned this was a common issue and some suggested just taking off the protector, cleaning the actual screen (easier), and getting a better screen protector online.That's what I'm in the process of doing, but I sure wish the phone had come with something better to start with.Note: After I removed the protector, realized I wasn't comfortable putting the phone in my handbag to go out, since I feared scratching the screen.So I re-cleaned the actual screen, then re-attached the factory-provided screen protector (only thing I have until the new one arrives).It was difficult to re-attach, lots of bubbles.I worked on it for a while and reduced the bubbles, then gave up since I know I'm just going to remove it again in a few day to put on the new one. Whole thing is a definite pain in the neck. So that is a definite area for improvement for the next version of the Honor 5X.Otherwise, it's terrific!",2016年3月20日 在美国审核

While everything worked fine for the first few months,"While I've only had the Honor 5X for a few days, I have to say that I'm incredibly impressed at the sheer quality of the device.A quick backstory: Before I bought the Honor 5X, I was using an LG G5. While everything worked fine for the first few months, eventually the phone started having major issues with overheating and the battery couldn't hold a charge. Before long, the screen started to malfunction and eventually stopped working altogether. Not wanting to pay the deductible for a new device that, at this point, I wasn't too thrilled about - I started researching unlocked ""third party"" phones and eventually found the Honor 5X.At first, I was extremely skeptical. However, after doing some research into Huawei as a company I found that they were actually fairly reputable. Many tech blogs have praised them for their competitive tablets and computer accessories and their phones have been no different.I purchased the Honor 5X and eagerly awaited the delivery of my new, unlocked phone. When the phone arrived, my first impression was of the really sleek packaging. It looks premium before you even unbox the item. The phone itself has a really nice weight to it, the brushed aluminum case makes it look as high end as it's major brand competitors.The interface, while an update or two behind on the latest Android devices, is very snappy and it wasn't difficult to navigate my way around and get the phone running up to my specifications. My apps and contacts synched and downloaded seamlessly and within an hour I had a phone that was, more or less, where I wanted it to be. There are some additional settings that are noticeable, like management of the optional dual SIM cards (even down to customizable ring tones and patterns for each card), but they aren't by any means in the way or a hassle to deal with.The most impressive feature, by far, is the remarkable battery life. I'm a very heavy phone user (one of those pesky millennials) and I use my phone almost constantly while at work for podcasts, music, etc. So far, I've yet to need to charge the phone during my work day despite my usage and even after a full day, I've been going to bed and setting the phone to charge with around 20 percent of battery life left. I've never had a phone work like that before.The camera is okay, nothing to write home about. It takes decent photos but nothing extraordinary.As far as cons go, the only one I can really think of is the lack of the fingerprint-proof screen coating. The phone comes equipped with a pre-installed screen protector (very nice) but it's a fingerprint magnet and I find myself cleaning the screen way more than I'm used to. However, for the price and the quality otherwise, this is a very small issue that can easily be outweighed by the positives.Overall, the Honor 5X provides most (basically all aside from the issue above) of the features and quality one would expect from a standard ""main brand"" smartphone for approximately a third of the price. So far, based on my experience - I'll definitely be sticking to the unlocked phone route from now on.",2017年2月22日 在美国审核

200 bucks? here take the money i love it,This phone exceeded my expectations. The screen quality is better than my old iphone5s and the metal body really gives you that premium feel and look. Rear camera is good but not as good as you would think for a 13megapixel camera. Front camera is also good snap chat and Skype will gets its use out of it. The battery also stands out above 800$ phones. I don't understand why they don't put 3000+ milliamp hour batteries. The phone is very fast and going through the apps is a seamless experience. My favorite part of the phone is the location and the accuracy of the finger print scanner. It is perfect. The speed is maybe a few milliseconds slower than the 5s but who cares its a 200$ phone. Lastly if I were to be honest I would say that this feels like maybe a 500$ phone compared to Samsung and apple 800$. Not sure what it is but its so close to feeling like a flagship. I am very happy with this phone and look forward to using a 1920/1080 screen and expansion of 128 GB cough apple cough. On their 6 gen and still no 1080p haha,2016年4月13日 在美国审核

I send my phone into them for repairs for 10-14 business days.....while I have no phone. This is not realistic.FYII am not a phone snob.I currently have a Galaxy Note 3 and have been looking to make a switch.However, I didn't want to spend $500 (or whatever) on a new Samsung or do the whole Next program with AT&amp;T.I travel a bit internationally and a foreign colleague of mine purchased the Honor 5x.What I like, you ask?It can use multiple sim cards.I transferred my US card to my 5x and I will purchase/use a sim card from the country I primarily visit overseas in the other slot.Perfect.Operates similar to my Note 3.Swipe to text. Android/Google.Play store is here, Kindle....literally everything my Note 3 has.This isn't a fair comparison because my Note 3 is 3 years old-ish, but the camera is better on the 5x.The screen is sharper too.I always get nervous about switching phone brands.I've been with Samsung for 5 years (Apple before that).So I really quizzed my foreign colleague about this phone and spend about an hour researching it online.I wasted my time.This phone is great.If you have any android device and want a great phone that is shockingly being sold for under $200 you'll love the 5x** Update**I've been using this phone now for about 10 days.Again, all comments are relative to my Note 3.The battery life is MUCH better.I even replaced the battery in my Note 3 about 4 months ago and the 5x is still significantly better.The screen is even more detailed when watching tv on the 5x.The controls are very intuitive.It took about 2 days to be fully comfortable with the 5x.",2016年6月8日 在美国审核

Got it and the second day it became so discharged it wouldn't charge anymore so I figured if I left it all night all would be good.. nope. So after hours of troubleshooting and trying things off the internet I finally got it. Now less than two weeks later it's doing again. Now I'm not saying these are bad phones.

Fortunately the wonderful support of Amazon was able to work with me without hesitation (the only positive aspect of my experience was Amazon support, seriously, best customer service experience...Huawei on the other hand....never again, was so rude and unwilling to work towards a logical resolution.) Anyway, end up ordering the same phone as I thought the initial was a software failure of sorts....within a week I was back in the same situation which I am still dealing with. A terribly crafted piece of technology that some $60-$80 phones well exceed the performance of. Don't buy this phone if you actually need to navigate anywhere, answer calls, or complete task that most phones should be capable of...and spending what I did my expectations were not that high, yet we're significantly less than satisfactory and met.Don't buy this phone.Just don't.",2017年8月16日 在美国审核

Not Good For Pokemon Go,"I bought it to use for Pokemon Go, as my last phone couldn't handle the game (Amazon fire phone). This phone doesn't have a gyroscope, but that wasn't a deal breaker. The biggest issue is the RAM. It only has 2Gig and with all the bloatware, system software, and regular apps, the phone runs incredibly slow and freezes when trying to play the game. The phone has about 0.8 gig available from startup and Pokemon will use 0.4-0.6 gig of RAM. I have to force close regular apps like Facebook, photos, mail, videos, voice to text, and anything else just so I can play the game. Now there are several apps that don't work properly, but it's either that or no games!!!",2017年4月18日 在美国审核

It just doesn't read the signal at all. Even at 2.4ghz, it has trouble picking up the WIFI signal. I had to restart the WIFI connection on my router several times for this phone to read it. I tried looking up the specs regarding the WIFI connectivity for this device, but it's not listed in the user manual or here on the site. I turn off my mom's data, in order to prevent her from going over the limit. She's always in an area with WIFI, but this phone won't even connect to my home WIFI 80% of the time.If I had to do it over, I would spend the extra few dollars and buy a One Plus 2 over this phone.",2016年6月8日 在美国审核

Don't bother.,"This phone performs poorly in the real world. It's plenty quick when you first get it, but install some apps and put a second SIM card in and it bogs down to a crawl. I used it for a few days before I migrated apps and settings over from my old phone, and I loved the performance. Everything changed when I tried to make it my fully functioning smartphone. It's got a small internal memory, and it doesn't allow adoptable storage. That was a big selling point for this phone. I assumed I would be able to expand the memory because I saw reviews that claimed it could be done, but Huawei seems to have disabled that feature since I bought it. You can't get much technical information on the device because the Huawei website is not aimed toward English users, and they have not responded to any emails requesting more information. The phone lags most of the time, then it will randomly zip along doing anything I ask. It's not uncommon to take 30-45 seconds for the browser or camera to open. I'm constantly monitoring the RAM, clearing cache, and restarting like I haven't had to do since Froyo or Gingerbread. I have about half the apps on it that I had on my LG G3, which never gave me any performance issues, but this phone is acting like it's maxed out. I keep deleting apps in hopes of finding a culprit that is not compatible with the phone and causing all these awful performance issues, but I think the problem is just the actual phone. I got it because I needed dual SIM at a reasonable price, but I am frustrated on a daily basis. It has some nice features, such as the fingerprint sensor, but it's just too slow and weak. It's glitchy, with regular random restarts. I think I hate this phone, but I am stuck with it for now, so I will keep tinkering to try to make it easier to deal with.",2016年11月24日 在美国审核

ONe trip to my university at Arizona from home with the phone in the pocket and guess what! The metal rim got bent!

Very impressed!,"Where do I even start? I've had my Note 2 since the first day it was released and I have loved it. Now that we dropped big red I wanted to get an unlocked phone as I don't want any contracts. I didn't know anything about this phone a month ago. Luckily I stumbled across it. This phone is amazing! EMUI is a little different, but like most people I threw Nova Launcher on it and for the most part all of the negative EMUI stuff is gone. I threw a ST sim card and a 128 GB SD card in it. Huawei wasn't well know very much here in the West until they produced the Nexus 6p for Google and everyone took notice. This company had figured out exactly what people want out of a phone. Sure there are some things missing like NFC and ghz wifi, but it does have a fingerprint sensor which I have viewed as a gimmick since they started putting them on phones. Now that I have one and not just any one, but this one, I don't know how I loved without it before this. Relocating the sensor on the back of the phone is so intuitive. I can literally unlock my phone before it's even out of my pocket. That is how good and fast the honor 5x fingerprint sensor is. The battery last a ridiculously long amount of time. Here it is past 3 am and I've been using it all day and still have 65% battery at the moment.I originally ordered the Grey version and they sent me the white version. Sent a message to customer support on Amazon and instead of me having to send the phone back and be without a phone they allowed me to keep the wrong 5x and send it back when I receive my Grey one. Very nice to see that kind of customer support.I don't really know what else to say except if you have reservations, don't. You'll be happy with your purchase.",2016年2月8日 在美国审核

Good phone but died after 9 months and company not helpful,"Bellow is my original 4 star review, it is still valid, except the fact the phone died for no reason after ~9 months. While screen quality is important, having a working phone is even more important.I've tried to contact the company (still in warranty) several times over ~2 weeks. They answer immediately and are very polite and professional, only one small problem, nothing actually happens. No phone, shipping labels or shipping instructions are actually sent, only promised.Original headline: great hardware, excellent price, EMUI (Huawei android)is annoying and hard to replace.In short: great hardware, excellent price, EMUI (Huawei android)is annoying and hard to replace.Got this as a cheap replacement for a nexus 5 that started dying, not needing or expecting too much. Was pleasantly surprised by the hardware, feels like a very good and solid build, screen looks (IMHO) better than the nexus 6 my wife has, camera almost as good and faster. 5.5'' feels like the optimal phone size. Can do out of the box everything a normal user will want from a phone, supports both micro and nano sims, expandable memory and has a good screen protector (not the usual sticker) already on it.Instead of usual android, Huawei (like most companies) had to change it may make it ""theirs"", called EMUI. I didn't like it very much, too much visual noise, things pop up at you for no reason (including a survey, pre-build into the system).After giving it a short chance, tried to replace EMUI with cyanogenmod (custom open source version of android, if you want big companies and the government out of your phone, it's a first step). Huawei (like most companies) promises an unlocked bootloader to enable that (wouldn't have bought it otherwise). This is where it get annoying. They make replacing it way too hard. Doing it on a nexus was a peace of cake. Here you need to open a user account (name, email etc') on their website to get a code to unlock it. Flash connections don't work well without their software (not just drivers) on your computer. No guide works, due to changes between subversions of the 5x, software versions etc'. It took me way too long to the this simple thing done. After getting that done, I'm again happy with a great phone, it would have been a 5 star review if they have just kept to simple android and an unlocked bootloader, something that would have cost them nothing.",2017年1月30日 在美国审核

No signs of tampering with the unit, no damage, box was sealed with the security tape.Went online and got the support phone number and they walked me through trying to revive it without success.I did a return to Amazon.",2017年4月24日 在美国审核

Amazing phone!,"This phone is amazing at an amazing price. It actually works better than my Samsung galaxy S4 which I ended up paying nearly $700 for. It is fast, it takes excellent pics, and has a great screen display. Bigger than my S4 for sure. I love it and will buy it again. If you want a quality phone without the expensive price tag, it's a no brainer.",2016年12月7日 在美国审核
