Good quality for being refurbished,"Despite the basic packaging, I was quite impressed with the condition of the phone, it looked brand new without a single scratch, which was one of my main concerns, when purchasing a refurbished phone. It also came with nicely packaged; headphones, aux adapter cable, and a charger. What I like the most about this purchase, was the fact that it was SIM unlocked(read some reviews saying it wasn’t). I was able to insert my AT&amp;T SIM card and have it work immediately without any complications, I was able to call/text people within minutes of activating the phone. I’ve only had this phone for a week now and so far nothing seems to raise any red flags yet, I’ll update my review if anything changes.",2018年7月4日 在美国审核
Just don't do it.,"Leason learned with this one.I received the phone a couple weeks ago, but waited for my daughter to get home from college for Christmas before activating it.After she activated it, she was having problems sending messages, etc., so she went to the Verizon store for help.She was told the serial number for the phone is blacklisted because it has been reported lost or stolen.When we tried to re-active her old phone, her number had been blocked for fraud associated with the stolen/lost phone.She and my husband were on the phone with Verizon last night for more than two hours trying to get this mess resolved.Don't do it.It's not worth it.Just get a new phone.",2018年12月15日 在美国审核

A great phone from a great seller!,"I researched the iPhone 6,7, and 8 as replacements for my aging 5s. I also sought out sellers with good ratings for this purchase. I settled on MyWit based on their reviews and their volume of sales. The phone arrived a day early and it is absolutely pristine. If it is a refurb, there are zero signs of that as there are no marks anywhere on it. Not even finger prints or dust. It came with a nice flex lighting cable and Apple charger (no sim as advertised).I put the sim card from my old iPhone 5s in it and went through the setup questions. I had a fully functional iPhone 8in 5 minutes tops.I selected the iPhone 8 over the 6 or 7 due to the advanced technology in the 8. It is worth the extra $100 over the same size 7.It is fast but the battery lasts all day without showing significant signs of needing a charge.I also purchased a Speck Candy Shell case for this phone. The iPhone 8 has a glass back for wireless charging and it is very smooth and slick to hold. With my dry fingers, it is difficult to even use the phone so a case is necessary to give it some grip. The Speck case is a perfect, anti-slip and lots of drop and screen protection. See this case here https://www.amazon.com/Speck-Products-CandyShell-Phone-iPhone/dp/B01K094IZ8Very pleased with the seller too and I would certainly use them for another phone purchase without question!",2019年3月28日 在美国审核

Perfect,"I usually seek refurbished products as it is a good way to get quality devices at slightly lower costs than buying them new. I found this listing and I will admit that I was a little skeptical about making the purchase because of how few reviews there were. I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way that I could be assured that this would be a good purchase. They were very polite and gave me all of the info on the warranties provided by both them and Apple.I received the product and it was in MINT condition. The phone had absolutely no sign of ware whatsoever. It has been working perfectly for 4 months now, and I could not be happier with my purchase.The packaging clearly wasn't original and the charger was not OEM, but this is stated in the product description so I knew what I was getting into. No big deal.If you're the type of person that is willing to give up a fancy unboxing experience to save about $100, this is an excellent option for you.Additionally, I had no problems switching this phone over on my Verizon account.

Basically Brand New,"I was looking for a reasonably priced iPhone 8 and happened to stumble upon this phone. I was skeptical at first because it was the cheapest I could find anywhere online, however, I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. The phone was advertised as a renewed phone that could vary on the degree of visual usage and battery health. Aside from one scratch on the back glass, the phone is flawless. The battery is also running at 100% capacity which was one of the most important categories for me when buying a new phone. I also checked the IMEI number and model number to find out more information. I was very happy to find that the phone was only 8 months old, and basically brand new with all original parts. This checked all the boxes and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. For any one that cares my order was fulfilled by CR Land, who has their orders fulfilled by amazon. You can feel safe knowing that if you have to return your item or have any issues you will be dealing with amazon directly. You will not be dealing with the store front who supplies the product which is a plus since amazons return process is relatively painless. I would definitely recommend this product to another person just make sure you watch the prices, they often change and you may miss out on a deal that is up to $40 less than what is usually offered.",2019年5月10日 在美国审核
Works Great But Here's A Tip For Straight Talk Users,"Have only had the phone a couple of days but so far it works great.It is an iPhone 8, 64GB model.It looks brand new and everything functions as it should.A note to Straight Talk users.That is my carrier and when I put my Straight Talk SIM card in this phone it works great but I went to the Straight Talk website and logged in so I could transfer my new phone and register it.The website kept giving me an error when I entered the phone's IMEI or serial number so I called Straight Talk support.<br>After working with me for a while, the rep said ""You can't use your current SIM card because you have an unlocked phone.You are going to have to buy a new SIM card and then register that and the new phone with our ""Bring Your Own Phone"" system on the website.""I asked if I did that could I keep my phone number and he said yes.I did some research online and got the impression the the Bring Your Own Phone is not for existing customers, but for new customers or existing customers with new phones who want new phone numbers.Not sure about that, but my thought is that since the phone works perfect as it is, I am not going to try to upset the apple cart by buying a new SIM and trying to register it with Straight Talk.I think they don't want us users to have unlocked phones and especially ones that were not purchased through the Straight Talk website or an authorized supplier so I am leaving well enough alone.The phone works fine with my SIM card, the only thing is that on the Straight talk website it shows I have a Samsung Galaxy instead of an iPhone 8.No harm, no foul.</br>",2019年12月31日 在美国审核

Great price! Phone works. A little wear. Works with Ting!,"The phone came as described in awesome packaging (as in, not just a cardboard box). The phone works great, it's fast compared to my iPhone SE, and was nearly flawless cosmetically. It had the signs of good use with a couple of scuffs, but that was covered up by the case I purchased. Besides, cosmetics don't affect the performance of the phone.Something I was a little leery about was the description, so here's my experience: The phone I received was unlocked and works great with Ting. The description said unlocked, but some reviewers mentioned that they received a GSM phone, and I was looking for CDMA. I received a phone that was unlocked that worked on either carrier network. I purchased from BuySPRY. I hope they don't mind I mentioned them.It is my understanding and from my research that unlocked and fully unlocked are roughly the same as carrier unlocked and factory unlocked. However, if the description specifies a specific network like ""unlocked GSM,"" then the phone will only work on GSM networks. Make sure to do your research on the phones before purchasing and contact the seller with questions. That's what I did and it worked out to my benefit.",2019年5月31日 在美国审核
"Better Than New, It's USED (A Good ""used"" Product)","""Refreshed"" is the new term for ""pre-owned,"" or ""refurbished,"" and if you don't need bragging rights for owning the latest and greatest high-tech device, this model of iPhone 8 might just fit the bill. Compared to the whopping prices demanded for the latest versions of the iPhone, while these are not cheap, they are certainly much more affordable, and these iPhones can perform the majority of the fancy stunts of the latest iPhones with a few differences, including having to make do with 4LTE, rather than 5G network speeds when it becomes widespread.The two iphone 8's we purchased arrived in good condition, one with a few minor screen scratches that we can live with, otherwise both intact and usable in every way, including with batteries that charged in the 90 percentile ""health"" status. The phones are unlocked and the two we received will work with both SIM cards on GSM, or on (non-SIM card) CDMA networks. We used the SIM cards from our old phones using the ""Speed-Talk"" (T-Mobile) network; these SIM cards came from cellular plans we bought from Speed-Talk on Amazon, and once the SIM cards were inserted, the phones worked perfectly.As of April 2021, the iPhone 8 supports the latest iOS operating system updates, and hopefully will remain on Apple's ""security update"" list for a number of years to come.Our experience with the two iPhone 8's, (used in conjunction with a late model Apple iPad), has us agreeing that Apple has created an excellent interlocking system for personal communications, which explains the popularity of the iPhone and its cousin, the iPad.It is worth mentioning that the function of ""iCloud,"" (Apple's server farms) which serves as a continuous (free for five gigabytes of space) backup system for your ""i""-devices; also works as a means to share notes, photos, email, calendars, and contact lists and can be accessed online using a web browser from any computer, no matter what the operating system. Appointments and contact information can also be added or modified while accessing the ""iCloud"" account from a web browser, adding a great deal of functionality to the iOS communications system. Absent from web browser access is the iOS ""Message"" presence, apparently because Apple does not want this popular message application being used or accessed on anything but ""i""-devices.The iPhone 8's were simply but sturdily packaged with a ""lightning"" charging cable and a standard USB to 110 AC adapter enclosed. Also, a tiny ""SIM card holder"" release tool was in the box, with a short prong about the diameter of a paper clip that will release the SIM card holder so you can insert your own micro SIM card into side of the iPhone. There was a walk-through brochure enclosed of how to charge and power up the iPhone, but if you are new to the methods of using one of these devices, you might want to visit YouTube where there are lots of videos about using iPhones. We had never owned ""smart-phones"" before, but we picked up the skill set easily without too much trouble or much of a learning curve. (Going through the multiple settings and options takes some time and thought, but that can be done at your leisure).With cellular networks turning off 3G and earlier network connection configurations, the iPhones were a good choice, with iOS ""message"" and ""Facetime"" options, as well as our use of a VOIP system that works through both the iPhone cellular and wireless network, allowing us to save on cellular minutes by using WiFi for sending and receiving phone calls.The ""refreshed"" iphones work well and we find they are quite handy, though we have, to date, refrained from the habit we see everywhere of people quickly pulling out their smart-phone at every opportunity and waving it around in front of their face. If we ever reach that point of insane phone-mania, we'll have to go back to using a taut string with two tin cans for our communications.",2021年4月14日 在美国审核
Reviews scared me... but was pleased with my purchase.,"I read the reviews AFTER I purchased and instantly got nervous. My daughter had her phone stolen from her so I was somewhat in a rush to replace it for her, and a refurbished iPhone 8 for under $200 seemed like a pretty good gig. First, I got the phone 2 days sooner than expected which was nice because I was able to set it up and make sure all was well before she was even expecting it. When first looking at the phone, it was in great condition. The charger we were provided wasn’t manufactured by apple but it definitely does the job. My fear was going to be that the phone wasn’t truly “unlocked” as some reviews state. But it was a relief when the phone company told me there was no problem at all and quickly set it up for me. Her phone was up and running almost as soon as it arrived on our doorstep (after stopping by the store for a new SIM card which wasn’t provided. No problem for us though, it only ran us about $10.) overall I’m thankful we purchased this phone because it saved me a lot of money and works just fine for my daughter!

"The ""Renewed Premium"" iPhone 8 is a great buy!","When the charging port on my old iPhone SE (first generation) went bad, I needed a replacement. But what? Any new phone from Apple costs a small fortune. Yet buying a used or ""renewed"" phone from third-party suppliers is always a gamble.<br>So with considerable trepidation, I searched Amazon for ""renewed"" options. I knew that third-party sellers' ""renewed"" phones came with an Amazon-backed 90-day guarantee. But then I discovered Amazon's ""Renewed Premium"" products. That's where hired techies put the product through rigorous restoration and (in the case of the iPhones) 20-point testing, after which Amazon offers a full year's guarantee, for any reason. That generous guarantee, and the fact that Amazon would ship the product directly, reassured me: I decided to buy only a phone covered by that ""Renewed Premium"" warranty.In choosing, I wanted a step up from the first-generation SE and the dated iPhone 7. I also wanted one whose battery could be recharged via a wireless charger, rather than those plug-in ports, which can wear out (it's happened to me twice).I settled on the iPhone 8 -- the silver model, 64 gb, fully unlocked for all carriers, and of course with the Renewed Premium guarantee. Its product page promised me ""a like-new experience."" I figured that was probably a bit of an exaggeration -- that any used/renewed phone must have SOME deficiency, if only minor cosmetic damage or a less-than-100% battery.Well, I'm thrilled to report that by ""like new,"" Amazon delivered me a renewed iPhone 8 that looks and functions as if it had just come fresh off Apple's manufacturing assembly line. I mean a gorgeous, pristine-looking phone with ZERO defects, scratches, or cosmetic blemishes on its screen, edges, or back. After swapping the SIM card from my old iPhone SE, the iPhone 8 powered right up, and -- as far as I can tell after several days of use -- it functions perfectly in every respect. Furthermore, even though Amazon only promises that the phone battery will charge to at least 90%, mine charges fully, to 100%. In short, it's a phone indistinguishable from a brand-new one -- but at a far-more-affordable price of just a few bucks over $300.Let me add that the phone wasn't casually swathed in bubble wrap and dumped into a cardboard shipping box, either. Instead, it came packaged in a sturdy ""Amazon Renewed"" box -- one that was custom-designed to hold that model iPhone, its charging cable, its wall plug, and a SIM tray opening tool. Each item was individually wrapped in plastic and fit inside its own designated slot in the box. This extra care in secure, well-designed packaging was much more than I expected.I've experienced many good transactions for a lot of great products on Amazon. However, this iPhone 8 purchase may be my best experience yet. (Okay, except perhaps for the purchase of my own thriller novels, published via Kindle Direct Publishing -- but hey, I'm biased). I eagerly recommend this particular model of the excellent iPhone 8, purchased under the ""Renewed Premium"" option. With that guarantee, there's absolutely no downside risk, and I think you can confidently expect to enjoy a truly ""like-new"" phone.--Robert Bidinotto, author,The Dylan Hunter Thrillers Series</br>",2020年8月21日 在美国审核
"Looks, feels and functions like a new iPhone!",I needed to replace my old iPhone 5S because of the slow processor speed and not so great camera.The iPhone 8 was priced right and I'm very happy with it.The hardest part of the upgrade was getting the sim card tray to open on my old phone.My previous phone was also a refurbished unit which worked flawlessly for nearly four years.I've had the new phone for about a week now and there is a lot of new functionality that I have yet to use so it will keep me entertained for a while becoming familiar with them.,2018年10月29日 在美国审核
Renewed Premium is the way to go,"Upon opening the box there is a packet of information with ""Open me first"" on it.If you do that the set up is flawless.Once you turn on your new/used iphone and enable bluetooth and set it next to your old iphone it pretty much transfers all your settings, address book and apps in a matter of minutes, it could not have been any easier. You then use the tool provided and put your sim card in and it's ready to use. On the renewed premium phones the battery health is supposed to be at least 90% or better, to my surprise it's at 100%.The iphone itself looks like it's a new phone, not a scratch on it, it even has a month or so left on the original Apple warranty from whoever owned it before.I've been wringing it out, texting, taking pics, making calls and using all of the new features this has to offer that my old iphone 6 plus didn't have and so far so good.While I liked the bigger screen on the 6 plus I could never get used to the size and wanted a smaller profile with more processing power and this fits the bill for me.I don't know if all renewed premium phones are like the one I got but I'm really impressed, better yet I have a full year to put it through it's paces.I wanted to upgrade to a newer faster model iphone without breaking the bank.My hats off to Amazon and the tech., MM in New Jersey that tested and signed off on the 20 point inspection certificate, nice job on an outstanding phone.",2021年3月5日 在美国审核

Outstanding value!,"I wanted to change to a new carrier that did not support my current phone. The carrier supports less than 20 phones and the iPhone 8 is one of them. After looking at all the phones that would work I started narrowing them down by cost and power. This phone at 256gb of internal memory for less than $300 was by far the best value. After reading the reviews I was a little concerned about appearance and battery life but that is definitely not a problem. The phone that arrived looked brand new, not a mark on it. I do not use a phone heavily, a little bit of internet surfing, a few calls and a few texts. Before setting the phone up I left it turned on in standby mode for 48-hours and it still had most of the battery life left. When the new SIM card arrived I gave the phone and full charge and started the setup. After setting up the phone, icloud, carrier, synching to old phone, downloading new apps I wanted and leaving phone on for 36-hours there was still over 60% battery life left. That is more battery life than I am likely to ever need. The only drawback I have found so far is the camera. When using indoors, photos have a yellow look and are just terrible. The camera does seem to do a really good job on outdoors shots. This is the first iPhone I have had so it may be the camera in the renewed phone is just subpar and not indicative of all iPhones.Pros:memory, touchscreen sensitivity, fingerprint sensor, included applications, screen visibility, appearance, ease of use, wireless charging compatible and price.Cons:camera is awful, my $50 Alcatel took better indoor photos.Overall: Camera notwithstanding, I would recommend this phone to anyone. A coworker just bought the same phone new, with half the memory and paid $200 more than Amazon's renewed price.",2020年2月18日 在美国审核
Exactly as advertised.,"The Iphone 8 was in prefect condition with not a scratch to be found anywhere.It had the exact memory as advertised.I could not be happier with it.T-Mobile on the other hand was terrible.The first store told me that the phone was not compatible and that I should go get another one.Even though it displayed T-Mobile when it was turned on it wasn't compatible?Really?The next store took a really long time to add a SIM card and the customer service support for the stores is as bad as the ones we get when we call.One guy ""accidentally"" hung up on us after half an hour after it was clear that he didn't know what he was doing.The next person got the phone going but assigned the SIM to my existing phone.Now we had two phones that didn't work.The next rep couldn't believe that we didn't do this on purpose but was able to get them both going.So the phone is great T-Mobile is not.",2022年1月2日 在美国审核
Excellent Phone - The extra storage is very helpful!!!,"Dislikes:1. Because this was a refurbished unit, the battery life is not that of a new phone.2. The Wi-Fi hotspot loses connectivity - at times it is better to is the Bluetooth connection, which eats more data.3. I came from android, so the inability to put widgets on any multiple screens is disappointing. This makes the ""Home Screen"", which is the only place you can put widgets, useless. I want my weather widget on top of my most used apps on the first page of my phone. Apple offers very limited widgets. Most apps do not have one.4. There is a glitch in the iPhone 8 that causes it to very frequently turn the volume all the way down at random times.Likes:1. Not requiring anti-virus is nice.2. Siri is worlds better than Google Assist. (waiting for some developments that would allow additional voice activated options, like ""Siri, read me the content of website xyz"", etc.). Siri is the main reason I switched from android. It is awesome!!!",2020年11月4日 在美国审核
"Good deal, almost new phone","First time buying a refurb phone. Daughter needed a replacement for her old one that looked as if someone had taken a sledge hammer to it. How does a phone get like that? Works great. Delivered with a good battery. It was at or very near 100% life. No dings or scratches. With 256GB of storage I will never hear again about running out of storage. Came with used protective glass installed which had a few chips in the corner but no big deal. Have not got to it yet, but easily replaced. Also bought a silicome cover and replacement glass. 9 months, so far, so good.

Great Refurbished iPhone 8 from TRADEMORE.,"Purchased two rose gold iPhone 8’s from the company TRADEMORE. The phones arrived in two days and in great condition. Everything seems to work as it should including the cameras, speaker, microphone, and touchscreen. The battery health is above 80% on both phones; which is great for a used/refurbished phone. There is no cosmetic damage to be noted, and all functions worked upon installing my SIM card.<br>TRADEMORE sends the phones in their own packaging and includes a Verizon wall pack with an 8 ft usb to lightning cable. Inside the packaging included a flyer that ensures a 90 day warranty. I’m pleased with the phones and would buy from this company again.</br>",2021年2月12日 在美国审核
Awesome purchase!!,"Bought this for my son for Xmas, came way ahead of time, looked &amp; felt brand spanking new! Finally got it on my Tmobile plan &amp; it really is a perfect Amazon Renewed phone. If it came in an actual iphone box it would be flawless &amp; my son wouldn't even have known it wasn't actually from an Apple store. This seller also sent an extra 365 day warranty card with the device &amp; only asked for an honest review.

Small but not out of date.,"I've never owned a iPhone before, so i decided to go the refurbished route due to this, and I'm significantly impressed. this tiny guy was a hassle to get used to screen size wise initially but after a week or so, it was easy.Also being refurbished there were a few things to note.1. This unit originally was a SPRINT CDMA model, with a Qualcomm radio inside.2. It was fully unlocked however. Works with both Mint Mobile and Verizon3. If it matters, benchmarking speed tests oddly made this unit max out at 200mbps no matter how many times i tried.and 4. battery capacity for me was 96%, and this unit holds about 5 hours of charge with low power mode enabled. 96% battery with 230 charge cycles.Translation.. a 1821mAh battery, with a 720p screen, grants you 5 hours of screen on time, somehow.. Just don't play games with this, it'll kill the battery quickly.5. probably not that important, but the display, camera and touch ID sensor were all replaced which probably meant whomever had this device originally probably shattered the screen.So all in all its hard to get used to. I'm so used to needing a 4000mAh battery in my old phone to give me the same all day battery life, yet this one with under 2000mah gives me 1.5days of battery life easy.oh and i would go and buy the apple smart battery accessory as well. it increases your battery capacity to 4100mAh total, and this phone usually lasts about 4 days on a single charge. its nuts.

A rocky start -- but then just fine,"I purchased this iPhone 8 (with the Renewed Premium Guarantee) for my daughter.It arrived in excellent condition.However, the first day she had it, the phone would crash and restart when the battery reached about 40%.This happened again over the next couple days.I went into the battery settings (see attached screen shot) and found that the battery was seriously degraded, even though it was supposed to be in ""similar to new"" condition with a guaranteed capacity of at least 90%.So I called Amazon Customer Support for a replacement phone.It was a cumbersome process.The Amazon representative had to contact Apple, and he and I were on hold with Apple for about 20 minutes.When the Apple representative got on the line, the Amazon rep left the call.The Apple rep remotely ran battery diagnostics and confirmed that the battery was failing.She then told me the phone was out of warranty and wanted to quote out-of-warranty pricing to me for a new battery.I objected, stating that Amazon was guaranteeing this phone for a year and wondering why I had to pay for anything at this point.She then had to talk with her manager, and again I was on hold for several minutes.She came back and said that I would have to talk with Amazon about the phone.So I took the case number she gave and called Amazon back.I was on hold again for a few minutes with Amazon, but when the customer service rep came on the line, I explained the scenario and she took care of the replacement immediately.I received the new phone the next day.It arrived in excellent condition and thus far seems to be working perfectly.Everyone I talked to, both at Amazon and at Apple, was very nice and easy to deal with, it just took a lot of my time to resolve the problem.All told, I was on the phone for about an hour and five minutes just to get the phone replaced.I am satisfied with the replacement, I just wish the process would have taken less time.",2020年9月16日 在美国审核

"Arrived in good condition, but maybe change the packaging.","At first I thought I got scammed because the box it came in was just a generic smartphone box, which sounds fine at first, but the box had the details of a completely different phone so I was sweating a bit when I saw that. The phone was correct, though, and came in good condition. It wasn't perfect, as you'd expect from a refurbished phone; there was a tiny scuff in the metal on the upper right corner, but that doesn't bother me one bit since it's covered by my case. I think that $280 is a good price for a well-refurbished iPhone 8, since it also comes with the trust that it's in top renewed condition versus buying for less from FB marketplace or something like that. I also purchased the protection plan which covers drops, cracks, water damage, etc. and it is well worth it to me. After the initial $50 payment, paying $29 to have my phone repaired or $49 to have it replaced in the case of it breaking is a great deal of a protection plan to me.",2020年2月6日 在美国审核
I could have never told you this wasn't a brand new phone,"I actually accidentally ordered this product when I meant to only add it to a wish list. I contacted the seller and they agreed to work with me to return it, but I decided to actually keep it, but kudos to the seller for being great! The phone was in perfect condition. It came on a recent but not the newest version of iOS so I had to update it before using it. No dents or scratches anywhere, battery health was at 100% when I checked it too. It does not come in original packaging or with Apple cables to charge it or to connect 3,5mm audio cables. It does come with a MFi (Made for iPhone) ac power brick and lightning connector cable and a sim eject tool to help you change sim cards.I just want to share some insight about GSM vs CDMA models. This is a GSM model phone, however I am a Verizon customer-- which is a CDMA network. GSM model iPhones have all the LTE bands that Verizon uses (I think Verizon's mainLTE band is 13 or 14 if you want to look up compatibilityyourself). So even with a Verizon sim card in this GSM only phone, I can still access all of Verizons 4g networks and have phone and text service, as well as LTE and voice over LTE. If I ever go out in the middle of nowhere I won't be able to make calls likely because I won't have access to Verizon's CDMA bands, but it's just as good as any CDMA model for most peoples uses, just don't expect to have cell service while camping or in some state/ national parks if you are a Verizon customer. 4g and LTE is rolled out very wide so you shouldn't have any issues.",2019年7月5日 在美国审核

It does what it claims and doesn't seem to have a lot of stuff running in the background depleting the battery and causing overheating like Androids I've had.

Can't tell it from a new one!,"Even though I purchased a renewed phone, I can't tell it from a new one and am very impressed with quality.I didn't rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition because I haven't (and probably won't) use those features.The battery life is sufficient for my activities, so it gets a 5-star rating.I don't play games or watch videos on it so far (since I'm an old geezer, lol!), but I do have a few, favorite apps I access from time to time.If you're not really tech savvy (like me) and can't figure out how to close the apps, just google the question and you'll find the answer.Closing the apps saves the battery, naturally.(I read where some were complaining about the battery life and, if they're not closing the apps, this may be the culprit.)<br>I had an old Android before and would never go back since purchasing an iPhone.I've read the iPhone is much more intuitive to use.Now, I have demonstrated such to myself.The camera is quite an improvement over the one in my Android.(The Android couldn't flip the view in order to take a selfie for one thing.)I've taken some really beautiful, true-to-color (imo) photos with the iPhone 8--comparable to my expensive (for me) Canon Rebel AND I don't have to change lenses for closeups, lol!Phone camera seems to take care of shake automatically, too.I'm still learning all the features of the phone (not just the camera) and will get more proficient over time.I really, really, love my ""new"" phone and wouldn't hesitate to recommend seller or purchase from them again.This is the first time I've purchased a used phone and was a little worried about purchasing a used/renewed phone, especially over the internet.I had absolutely no problem activating it (cell provider even gave me a free SIM card) and no malfunctions for the two weeks (now) that I've been using the phone.The only thing I would recommend to some reviewers/buyers (who say their phone won't charge) is the plug will fit into the phone either way.I found out it will only charge one way, however.So, I marked that side of the plug with a dot of magic marker and have had no problem since.(The plug in my old phone would only fit one way, so I couldn't screw up, lol!)Also, there's a way to put the battery indicator (life percent and charging indicator) on the front of your phone (at the upper right corner).Just google how to do this, too.Easy-peazy!That way, you always know if the phone is charging (by the lightning bolt on the battery symbol) and the percentage of charge.(I think my old Android had this feature on the front as a default.I had to direct the iPhone to do this.That's not a complaint.There may be others reading this who may not know they have to do this, either, if they want it on their front screen.)</br>",2020年10月12日 在美国审核

The phone aesthetically looks great. Scratch free as far as I can tell. No trouble operating. Needed updating to the latest iOS. The only disappointing part is the Battery Condition. These Renewed phones are guaranteed to come with batteries that have at least 80% capacity left. Mine came in at 81%. So technically its acceptable but unfortunately I will be spending another $50 soon for a new battery because it does not last under a day of light/moderate use.

Great Condition and Easy to Set Up,"I've been an iPhone user for the past 13 years, and while I love the interface and design, I do not like paying the high price for a new phone. Last month, after dropping my iPhone 6 (I know I'm very behind on the models, but it still worked well!), I made the decision to upgrade. I love that I can use Amazon Renewed to find a iPhone at a fraction of the price of a new one.Many of the reviews made me nervous about making this investment because the phones they received had some problems. Since the seller Hybrid IT had great reviews, I felt better about taking the risk. (To be noted, I initially bought a iPhone 6S from Hybrid IT, but then returned it after deciding to upgrade to an iPhone 8. The return was easy and the seller was helpful!)The phone I received was in great condition, and I had no trouble setting it up with my AT&amp;T SIM card. I've been using it for the last three weeks, and I haven't run into any issues.There are a few things to add, the phone came with a generic charging cord with a wall plug-in. It did not come with headphones, so if you are buying an iPhone 8, you'll have to buy Bluetooth headphones or Earpods with the lightning connector, which are about $29 on the Apple site. Finally, the battery health is at 84% according to my phone, which is expected with a refurbished phone. It does last me through the day, but something to note if you are in the market. I hope this helps!",2020年6月10日 在美国审核

The Best Purchase I could have Made...Hands Down,"I thank the seller because I was skeptical about the purchase and debated for a bit before taking the leap and purchasing. I am so glad that I did. I can understand why the seller is listed as the Best and are ranked as #1. Just like others who purchased this phone, I expected it to have issues and not be worth the purchase. However, I received the phone 5 days earlier than noted. It also arrived literally looking brand new and it works as if I had just purchased a brand new Iphone. Let's just say I am overly excited that I got such a deal and an amazing purchase. I am ready to buy all kinds of cases and accessories for my new phone! Yay!",2021年2月12日 在美国审核
Almost can't believe it's a refurbished phone,"I used to be an apple fanatic and then I switched to Google Pixel. Recently had a bad experience with a refurbished Google Pixel 2 phone because I failed to read the buyers reviews (always read them folks especially when buying refurbished phones) and I decided to go back to Apple because, why not.I didn't want any of the latest models because honestly I don't care for them so I was looking for an iPhone 8 in good quality and with significant storage. I came across this one and I was able to find a 64GB gold iPhone 8 through Verizon pre-owned. Honestly, highly recommend buying from Verizon pre-owned because not only did it accept my Cricket Wireless SD card effortlessly BUT, the phone is literally intact. It basically looks brand new. No scratches, not even on the corners. Clean screen and back of the phone. The fingerprinting works perfectly. All of its features work as if it was a brand new phone! Plus battery life so far has been doing incredibly well. So if you're thinking about switching over but are skeptical, try looking at Verizon pre-owned and their reviews and purchase!Looking forward to continuing taking bomb selfies with this phone.",2020年4月8日 在美国审核
Risk and reward,"I was very concerned about the hit or miss reviews from a used iPhone by others but I’m glad that I decided to take the risk.

"What I like - this is ""like new"" as promised","When I bought this used/refurbished phone, I was just happy to get an ""upgrade"" from my ancient IPhone 6; what I needed was something secondhand, affordable and still usable.I was pleasantly surprised to receive this order in a condition like new—even pristine, as promised by seller.In terms of functionality, the sensors and controls feel as though I've bought a new phone. All 256gb was available. The speakers, microphone and display work very well.When I was switching out the sim card from my old IPhone 6, the IPhone 8 started detecting the switch and offered an immediate transfer, without my activating the migration function - very cool. The transfer was so near perfect that the IPhone 8 migrated all my WhatsApp messages, which I was expecting to lose (because I don't use icloud). The migration was near perfect because for some apps or platforms, I needed to type in the initial passwords again (even though they were transferred to and saved on the IPhone 8) - just the slight bother of retyping a few passwords one more time.By the way, I am a Singapore buyer, and this order was routed through an Oregon transshipment facility, before it was shipped to Singapore.What's the takeaway I can offer in this review? Buying a secondhand product could be a lucky draw: there is a chance you may get a dud. In this order, I am happy to say that I got exactly what the seller promised. So here's my 5-star thumbs up!",2020年7月5日 在美国审核

IPhone 8 looked and worked like a brand new phone,I picked up the phone to replace my wife’s iPhone 6. Prior to buying an iPhone 8 through this method I read through a bunch of reviews. I admit that I was a bit nervous about buying the “renewed” device. I took the chance and bought it. The device was in really good shape. These phones are all glass. There wasn’t a scratch on the thing. It is pristine. My own 8plus has been in cases the entire time I’ve owned it and it looks more worn than the 8 I purchased here. There are zero signs of wear on the lightning port . Battery was at 90% health. I updated it to iOS 13 (it had 12) The phone looks and runs as if it were brand new.I can safely recommend this product and seller.,2020年4月24日 在美国审核

Choose seller wisely!!!,"Alright so I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review on our phone (in case we came across any problems with it). Fortunately, we’ve had our IPhone 8 since December now it’s January and have had zero problems with it. The phone actually came in pristine condition, no scratches or blown out/distorted speaker or any other problems! I do see that there’s others here that, sadly, have problems with their phone from the minute they receive it and I think it has a lot to do with the seller.

Worked for me and as advertised ,I read many other bad reviews but mostly because of the seller they got them from I heard the phones not being unlocked or in a certain case 1 blacklisted and some just down right complained about features they didn’t include such as headphones (which was in the description not included) mines came in this generic normal box and had like 2 very small scratches very unnoticeable til I looked hard while I cleaned my finger prints off the phone but I tested the for carrier lock or black list and the phone was in great condition unlocked as advertised 92% battery this phone almost looked brand new just be cautious of your sellers because when u chose a phone different options of sellers provide your choice as well but other than that I ratefelt like I got a great deal for a great price very satisfied,2020年2月5日 在美国审核
Exactly as described at an excellent price,"Shipping was super fast, arriving a day early. The phone was in good condition, as described. There is an area of scratches on the screen, but it’s in the top right and not on the actual touchscreen area; with a screen protector they’re not even viable. Everything works perfectly so far, and battery life is superior to my previous phone’s battery that was only about a year old.I was absolutely thrilled to find they included a screen protector in the box. I don’t remember seeing that mentioned in what was included, but it absolutely made my day since it meant I didn’t have to run out to get one or order one and wait for it to arrive.

Worth buying refurbished,"I bought this iPhone in March of 2020. I had always been an iPhone user before, but decided to try a google pixel… I hated the android phone. I didn’t want to break the bank on a brand new phone which at the time was the iPhone 11. I purchased the 8 because it was very reasonably priced, and I just wanted an iPhone again badly. I didn’t know what to expect from a refurbished phone, but I’m very impressed. The phone works just like you were to buy it at a retail store. Camera, fingerprint, apps, phone, and texting all work the way they should. My only complaint would have to be the battery life, but I kinda expected it to be somewhat lower than what the standards are today so I just charge it on my lunch break and I’m good for the rest of the day. I will continue to buy refurbished phones on Amazon probably for the rest of my life.",2021年11月27日 在美国审核
"Very pleased with purchase, just one little detail...",The phone was beyond my expectations and I love it so much. I was a little hesitant with the idea of it being refurbished but it hasn’t let me down so far.ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: apparently phones that are sold/to created in Chinese and other markets have a feature on the phone where it’s actually illegal to not have the shutter sound go off when you take a picture.

AMAZING! I recommend it...,"I am a 12 year old girl, and I payed my own money for this phone. It came in the mail on the last day that it said it would, so kind of on time.

The fingerprint reader doesn’t read your finger when your hands are sweaty, but that is the only time. I put in my left thumb, right thumb, left pointer, and right pointer into the thing and all of them work 99% of the time. The battery life is good, but I leave it on dark mode, True Tone off, and I always like to keep the brightness down.

It's a yup from me ,"I gotta be honest I didn't expect to get a damn near perfect iPhone 8.It was sim locked to AT&amp;T but less than 15 minutes after getting an approved unlock from their website and restoring the phone I was able to insert my sim card then use it on the CricketWireless service.There is one small tiny paint blemish on one of the edges but honestly it really isn't a problem because a case would cover it up easily. Other than that the phone has no scratches or dings anywhere else, battery is great, no Cloud lock and everything functions normally.I don't know if I got lucky or people are writing fake reviews but I am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that it comes with a 90 day warranty is a plus.Thank you for blessing me with a phone I could give to my mom cuz she loves having TouchID and having some newer features like wireless charging is a plus too (even though she's never going to use it).",2020年3月1日 在美国审核
"Risk Paid Off -- Take the Plunge, People--Also, Buy a Protective Case","I almost never write reviews--I think it's worth doing so here.Many of them here scared me.But, given that it was half the price of what my mobile carrier sold, I took the plunge and bought the product.I waited with morbid curiosity for it to arrive after seeing all of the negative reviews here.It arrived several days early and had one very small crack on the bottom left-hand corner that I really had to spend some time looking for to see why on earth it needed refurbished in the first place.Within 48 hours, I made a larger blemish to the poor R2D2 when I dropped it screen-side-down on my hard floors in my apartmentLuckily, the relatively small cracked section that my spectacular feat of juggling awesomeness caused didn't affect the visible part of the screen and added my own personal touch to the party,I guess, so the disaster mostly was avoided.This experience made me come to terms with the fact that it's only a matter of time before this device accidentally ends up in my commode.Pro Tip: I highly recommend ordering a case as soon as you order this so you don't end up like me.The iPhone has no issues whatsoever absent its operator, who is a darned klutz that never should be allowed to handle electronics absent close adult supervision.In all seriousness, I am thrilled with this purchaseApple designed them to be slippery.See that you buy a screen protector.",2020年6月1日 在美国审核

I have two boys that both have the iPhone 8 Plus and it’s consistent with their Battery Health. I put my daughter’s Verizon SIM card in the renewed iPhone 8 and haven’t had any issues.

I used a piece of painters tape kinda like a black head strip to remove this. I used a toothpick to get the tape in around the edges around the opening. I did this several times.

Great service,"I bought the iPhone 8 256. It looked like new when I received it. It did not come in the original iPhone box. It came in a cardboard box with the plug in to charge it and the little metal piece for SIM card. It worked great in every aspect except that I noticed the sound quality was not as good as my iPhone 5s, the sound was more “tinny” sound, probably not noticeable to others, but it was for me. I don’t know if it was a defect or how the iPhone 8 was made. It just startled me when I would use it for an alarm clock playing music. I did not have any problem at all returning the iPhone. The package came with a card that had their phone number and email address, backed by Amazon. There is a 90 day warranty and I turned it back in shortly before the 90 days was up. When I spoke with the customer service, they were really nice and just wanted to know what was wrong with the iPhone. I was sent an email with the return label and I sent it back with no problem and got a full refund. Even though the phone did not work out for me, I would still recommend this company because of their great service and following through with what they say they will do.",2018年10月15日 在美国审核

"Awesome , MetroPCS Compatible",Apple asks you to verify account login with the phone number you originally started your iCloud account with and unfortunately for me that was about 4 numbers ago so I couldn’t gain access to my old purchases or pictures.

I should've expected what I got,"I ordered 2 phones, and should have expected the worst since what I got wasn't all that. One phone has a bunch of mini screen scratches, a few deeper ones, and an extremely deep one that was unavoidable (photos attached just of this one phone). Along with that, the phone came with a few dents and scratches around the edges anyway (which was ok and what I expected). The other phone I got had very very very few screen scratches and the minimal amount of expected dents on the side. On top of that, the way the home buttons felt when you pressed them felt different between the two of them. Both phones turned on fine, sound worked and touch screens worked normal. However I didn't even bother setting them up since I was going to return them.Since this item is $150 less than a new iPhone 8, doesn't come with Apple charger or headphones, the price difference wasn't worth it in my opinion and I ended up returning both of the phones. I'm leaving two stars since one of the phones was in decent shape and since I expected to possibly return these phones anyway. Just expect the worst but low-key hope for the best because in my case with was pretty much night and day between the two phones.",2019年11月20日 在美国审核

"As advertised, except for the model number!","I specifically sought this US-based model number A1863: it is listed as such.Awesome.I instead received a Japanese version model A1902 (apple p/n MQ782J/A).Did you know that the Japanese model doesn't allow the user to silence the shutter sound effect when taking pictures, or the beeps when starting or stopping video recording?After some embarrassment in front of clients at job site surveys, I researched the model number and learned why it was happening.I ended up downloading a non-Apple camera app, in order to avoid the sound effects.If I was sent the A1863 model as listed, this issue would not have cropped up.That is why I am taking off one star from this review.To the seller's credit, the phone arrived a day early, was packaged well, and was in excellent physical shape.All I had to do was put my SIM card in it, and load in everything from my iTunes account.I've had it for several weeks, with no hiccups.AppleCare coverage was obviously expired and the battery reported its maximum health as 88%, but this is obviously a used phone.Still a good value for me.",2020年7月4日 在美国审核

COMPANY LIED IN THEIR ADVERTISING - PHONE WAS NOT FOR VERIZON AS ADVERTISED!!,"(I bought this for my son to be placed on my current VERIZON network plan) ...so..ok, let me start by saying that i received the phone via 2-day Prime shipping. Phone came in a generic box, but sufficient for transport. It included the charger and 3ft charging cable. nothing else. Unboxed, the phone was in EXCELLENT cosmetic condition, not a single scratch anywhere. I powered it on, the display was beautiful and worked as it should. At that point I ran thru the setup and got the phone all setup for my son (its his b-day present) ... then I took the phone to VERIZON STORE and had them put a VERIZON SIM in it for activation and to be added to my current verizon plan ....WELL GUESS WHAT... this phone is a model A1905, and it is ONLY GSM carrier compatible, NOT CDMA, which is what verizon is.... but yet, this phone was advertised as "" FOR VERIZON"" , which is the ONLY reason I went ahead and bought it. The Verizon models are A1863 &amp; A1864. So I have given the review 2 stars because of the great cosmetic, great camera and fully functional condition , but because they LIED, and DID NOT send me what I purchased (a phone for VERIZON networks), I do feel that this is unacceptable that tey are allowed to Advertise one thing, then send you another. Where I come from we call that a big fat LIE!!! and I DO NOT put up with LIARS, therefore Ireporting themfor FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and hopefully they will be kicked off of AMAZON",2020年6月4日 在美国审核

You’ll like it,"This is my third week with this phone. Its perfect but there’s a tiny few problems. First of all what I hate with a passion is the camera shutter sound which I tried everything I possibly could to turn it off but nothing at all worked. Then after some researched I learnt that all iphones from Japan are like this because it’s illegal to take photos in public on silent. Last thing is the battery life. It came with 97% capacity which is amazing but it goes kinda fast like my old phone but after watching some YouTube videos I think its just how iPhone 8s are because of all these running apps and stuff so I did turn siri and some few things off and it surprisingly improved my battery health a lot. So I don’t know if that’s how the iPhone 8s are. And also if you wanna buy this get the red one its beautifullllll. Mine came a with 0 scratches very neat with the charger( not original but its still very good) all nicely in a white box and you can buy this with confidence because you know there’s a 30 day or i think three months free return. And also I wanted to use this with simple mobile but it didn’t work so I currently use h2o wireless which is bum a**. Hope this review helped itspercent honest.Edit- you can fix the camera sound by downloading apps such as Microsoft Pix which allows you to turn off camera shutter sounds, other than that you’ll have to jailbreak your phone.",2019年10月5日 在美国审核

Excellent phone at a reasonable price.,"I bought this phone to replace a cheap Galaxy J3V which ran out of storage space after a few videos (16 gig vs 256 gig).I saw the Iphone had a different size SIM than the Galaxy so I ordered a new SIM from Verizon at no cost and got it one day after I got the phone.I charged the Iphone for several hours and started the activation.Wouldn't activate and I talked to 4 or 5 Verizon people over two days (and long waits for a tech).The last guy said he could see the phone and the SIM on his system but there must be something wrong with the phone, so I sent it back and said I would try another (the people at KISS were nice and got me a different phone).Both phones were in excellent shape and the second one had a nice screen protector already installed.Guess what?Still wouldn't activate.After over an hour wait on Dec 26, the Verizon tech said I needed to get a strong signal from a tower instead of a wifi signal.This immediately made sense to me (why didn't the other Verizon techs figure this out?)After a seven mile trip to a parking lot near a tower, the phone activated in about 15 seconds.Amazing, right?Not exactly.I got back home and couldn't do anything over wifi.The next morning I got to speak to a techright away but no solution.The next level tech told me he also lived outside of cell area and used wifi and knew the problem.Guess what, I had to go back to the tower to get a strong LTE signal to activate wifi.The phone works fine now and I'm very happy with it.KISS gets good marks and Verizon needs to know some people don't have cell service at their home.",2021年1月2日 在美国审核

I should've paid closer attention to detail,"I didn't pay attention and assumed that this was amazon refurbished so I didn't read the reviews.

I’m very content with the condition of this phone and it was easy to set up with the existing sim card I had in my old phone through Verizon! I will never buy a brand new phone from the store again! I do need to invest in a converter or some new headphones for the new port.,2019年6月13日 在美国审核

Careful of the IMEI,"A word to the wise, have BREED check the IMEI of what they're sending you. IMEI's are specific to GSM or CDMA, and even if the phone is fully unlocked, if the IMEI doesn't match, it won't work. For example, Verizon and Sprint have compatible IMEI's, and AT&amp;T and T Mobile are compatible.<br>I got a phone, and the IMEI did not work with my network, which is how I learned about all of this.A word on BREED, though. They are very easy to talk to, and very helpful. I doubt you will have any trouble reaching someone who can help you get the right phone for your network. I returned my phone with no problems, and they were very understanding about the difficulty.</br>",2019年7月7日 在美国审核

Almost as good as a new one....,"I was impressed with the phone.The battery lifespan on the phone when I got it says 90%.Not bad at all!No scratches, no dents, looked pretty much new.Saved hundreds and now I have the phone I wanted with 256gb to download anything under the sun which is why I replaced my old phone that only had 18gb.My work would only allow us to get the 18gb iPhone which really annoyed me but I understood why.So I took it upon myself when the battery started going to get my own phone &amp; just pay for it myself.We use AT&amp;T as a provider at my work, so all I needed to do was take out the SIM card from my old iPhone and put it in this 256gb beast....I’m so happy I did.So far so good.I recommend this seller for sure. Great product! I will update this review down the line if I end up having any problems out of the ordinary.Hope this review helps as I was very skeptical in buying used and saw some reviews that aided me in making this purchase.Also, I purchased using my Amazon credit card which allows you to make 12 monthly payments around $30/month at 0% interest.I can’t lose!!!That’s the cost of 10 coffees at Starbucks a month.I’ll enjoy my own brew for a year to offset the costs.Okay, I’m done.Now I just sound like a bag of hot air.",2019年8月30日 在美国审核

Good...the second time around.,"UPDATE:After I returned the first iPhone, I ordered a second one.The second one came very quickly as well.This one came with 81% battery capacity and much less pitting and wear than the 1st one.Since these are used phones, I guess it really just depends on the luck of the draw.I did notice the price increased a few dollars when I purchased the second one, so maybe there's something there? Anyways, adjusted my review from 2 to 4 stars.The second phone deserves 5 stars, but since I had to go through the process of returning the 1st one, which forced me to switch phones 2 weeks later than I would've liked, I say 4 stars is fair.ORIGINAL:To note: I am obviously returning this product, but will give time for the seller to make things right.I will change/delete my review if the seller can remedy the situation.To the seller's credit, this phone was delivered much faster than expected, almost a week early.However, what good is a phone that arrives early if it isn't as advertised.One of the only guarantees this product comes with is that the battery capacity will exceed 80%.That's directly from the description from the listing.Imagine my disappointment when I go to settings and see the message ""Your battery's health is significantly degraded..."" ""Maximum Capacity: 76%"".This is worse than the iPhone 8 I currently have and was trying to ""upgrade"", and keep in mind I had my current iPhone 8 for about 4 years now.Completely unacceptable.If even after all that, you still decide to purchase one of these, I should also mention, if you look close enough, you can tell you bought a used phone.This isn't to knock the seller or the product, it's clear you're not getting a new product, just shows minor signs of wear and tear.",2021年3月14日 在美国审核

Big dissapointment,"I was really excited to order an amazon ""premium renewed"" iphone. Sadly, the first phone was unable to update, and therefore I was not able to restore the backup from my previous phone to it. So I sent it back and amazon sent me a replacement. However, the replacement was a Iphone 8 ""plus"". When I called to ask why they sent the plus-sized phone, they told me that the regular size was out of stock...and therefore they gave me a $90 dollar discount to just keep the wrong sized replacement. I was okay with this, but within a day found out that the microphone on the replacement was dead and I had to yell for anyone to hear me when making calls. I called the ""premium renewed"" amazon support staff and was told that they had no replacement to offer me as the plus size phone was also out of stock. I sent the second phone back and got a full refund. At the end of the day, buying from ""amazon premium renewed"" was a big disappointment.",2020年10月1日 在美国审核

Renewed? Yes but almost perfect.,"I ordered this iphone specifically becauseits advertised as renewed. The condition of the iphone i received was, to the untrained eye, half renewed. Upon inspection, i saw the top left of the display where the mute switch is located, to be slightly lifted. I thought the worse, a bad, swollen battery. When i would press into the screen it looked as if something was pushing it up. Confused and worried, i went ahead and turned the display to full brightness to see if the batterywould drain too fast, surprised to watch netflix on full brightness i got 3 hours untill i hit 5% battery, so i shut off the phone, and proceeded to take apart the screen. What i found was astonishing. Firstly the battery was healthy and slim looking. Second, i tried putting the screen back on correctly but i couldnt snap one side in without the other getting caught on the inner frame. Upon further inspection the screws on the side that hold the display were extremelyloose and preventing the clipson the side to go in and snap into place. I tightened them up on both sides and lined up the screen top side first, and it snapped into place perfectlyflat. I am disappointed the phone didnt come as advertised in the pictures in accordance to claiming the phones being renewed. Summary, yes its an actual iphone, yes its fully functional, yes it looked new, no scratches, however, its obvious the phone screen was taken apart to either replace it, or replace the home button, or whatever reason to make it look new. But attention to detail was skipped with the loose screws that hold the lcd panel, and no new screen adhesive was applied to seal the phone and keep it looking actually renewed. Im lucky i alreadyhad a smartphone repair toolkit from home depot, to continue my phone ""renew"" procedures, any other customer who doesn't have the toolkit, or is afraid they might ruin their purchase, would probably give a not so constructive criticism review, but rather an upset, anger induced review. All in all im happy with the device and the quickness of the seller to ship the phone with fedex, from Maryland all the way to my place in california.",2020年5月3日 在美国审核

I took this picture for Amazon member elchamber.  27 November 2020,"I do not want to be negative about this iPhone 8.When received it looked like ""new"" condition.I was pleased with that.Day 1: Generic charger (included) did not work.Even I was ok with that.I had another from an iPhone.It worked fine so that is how I know the included charger ws defective.I was impressed with the packaging.It was so nice &amp; neat.I charged battery to 90% and, WOW, could not believe rapid it discharged (about 3 hours).I figured I had too many apps running in the background.That didn't solve the issue.Few features I set my preferences did not retain.After powered off and then on, my preferences were not saved.I do feel the phone is a value for the price and it does what it is intended to...Make &amp; receive calls.Bluetooth signal is great.I was trying to be ""thrifty"" but will just purchase a new iPhone (w/Apple Care coverage) and pay it in 24 months.I will be returning this phone.Again, for a younger, maybe school aged child it is a great phone.The Messaging/Text is fine and I was able to receive a small photo attachment.If I had a child, this would be the phone they get (from me) before I would buy them a $700 + phone!So my review is 3 stars and my main concern is the BATTERY LIFE.",2020年11月9日 在美国审核

It's an okay phone but..,"It's my first iPhone, always been into galaxy. I was pretty disappointed with some features overtime, makes me wonder how Apple is so rich with these bad decisions they've done for their phones. Android is way superior. I upgraded to the galaxy S21 Ultra and it's amazing. The iPhone was okay for the time being, but it only got worse at the last month I had it, i think my iPhone 8 was defective cause over half the time no one could hear me speak on the phone, sometimes better or worse on speaker, I'm so glad I'm done with this. I'm giving it a 3 out of kindness cause I had some good times with it mainly with music. But even then, putting music on an iPhone is stupid too. They're still stuck in 2008 relying on an app to transfer music (itunes) while Android is the future. Also couldn't edit videos on Sony Vegas cause that app doesn't support their stupid .mov files, so converting is necessary and I didn't wanna bother, so glad this phone isn't necessary no more, but if I had to say anything good about it, it's okay for the buck and if you like iPhones.",2021年3月15日 在美国审核

I don't think Kanga Supply does a very in-depth quality assurance,"By reading some other reviews and based on my own experience I feel as though Kanga Supply, probably doesn't do a very intensive quality assurance on their products. If I could guess, they get a lot of refurbished used phones, which for the majority of the time work fine, but there are going to be quite a few phones that are faulty. The phone I received wouldn't even turn on, despite trying to charge it with 3 different chargers. I guess it's my fault for not looking at their website, where they make no guarantees that their products work. If you need a phone immediately, I wouldn't suggest buying from here, unless your willing to wait 3-4 business days for an exchange or refund.",2018年11月8日 在美国审核

2 PHONES SENT NEITHER ONE WORKED PROPERLY,"I ordered the phone as a Christmas present and it arrived looking brand new. However, the sound did not work. She couldn't hear the person on the other end of the phone unless it was on speaker. I requested an exchange instead of refund. Within 2 days, I had the 2nd phone in hand and it was in pristine condition BUT it would not read her SIM card. I took the phone to AT&amp;T thinking it was a SIM card issue. However, it was a device issue. So while in AT&amp;T, I just chose a brand new phone to save myself the hassle of trying to get a working ""renewed"" one through Amazon.

Barely Functioned,"I should have known better- as soon as I tried to turn the phone on to set it up, there were problems. The phone was not responding to charging or me pressing the home/power buttons.I finally got it to turn on and assumed it was just a freak occurence (I was mistaken) and began to set up the phone. The phone kept resetting itself or shutting down completely throughout the night. Again, I blamed it the amount of data I was transferring from my old phone. (mistaken again)I used the phone for a few days, and it reset or shut down probably an average of 5 times a day. Sometimes the phone would freeze completely and become unresponsive to any buttons, touching, or even my attempts to force it to shut down. I would just have to leave it alone for an hour or until it reset itself again.I ended up returning the phone, and asked to exchange it for one that worked. The company faied to do so and sent me a refund instead. Now I am without a phone right before the holidays and must scramble to find a new one. I will not be buying this phone ever again and I recommend that you don't either.",2018年12月12日 在美国审核

Didn't work out of the box.  2nd one is working.,"I bought this phone to replace my old iPhone 6s, because the battery wasn't keeping a charge all day, any longer.When I got it home, I thought that my wife (who also has a 6s), might want to try it out first, since hers was having the same issue, but after thinking about it for a few days, she told me to try it out first.Well, first I had to find a YouTube video to figure out how to change the SIM card, since I hadn't done it in many years.Then, after carefully replacing the SIM card, I go to turn on the new/used phone, and -- nothing.I had charged it beforehand, so I knew the battery wasn't dead, but the Home button didn't work!The return process is pretty simple; but it's just a drag to get something new/used, only to have to send it back and get it replaced.I'll update this review after the replacement arrives.10/03/21 update: The replacement arrived a week ago and voila' -- this one works -- so far, so good!It seems the Home button on the iPhone 8 has a different ""feel"" than the iPhone 6s, which has a more positive ""click"" to it.Battery life is OK, but doesn't seem to be quite as good as a brand, new phone. Everything else seems to work OK, so my wife wanted to upgrade her 6s to one of these, since her battery wasn't lasting either.We just got hers &amp; transferred the SIMM card, so we'll see how that one does.",2021年9月20日 在美国审核

Buyer beware - shutter sound can’t be turned off!,"Everything about this product has been perfect. The quality was indistinguishable from new, it has functioned reliably and perfectly since I received it. This would have been an easy 5-star review except for one thing:This is a refurb unit from Japan, which means that the camera shutter sound is hardwired in and cannot be muted, turned down, or turned off.That one little thing is enough to make this unit borderline unusable for me, as I primarily (used to!) use my phone camera for wildlife photography on hikes.

No disappointments with the product or service,"My iPhone was scheduled to be delivered the day after the long Labor Day weekend, but it actually arrived the Friday before, which was an unexpected surprise. There were no scratches at all on the body or screen of the phone, it looked to be in virtually perfect cosmetic shape. Once I got it running from my iCloud backup everything seemed to work exactly as expected, and now a week later still is functioning perfectly.The camera takes excellent photos, the screen is slightly better than my iPhone 7 it replaced, and wireless charging seems to work perfectly- no excess heat, not overly slow. My only possible complaint with the phone is that it came in with a slightly lower battery health percentage than I was hoping for- 89%. I was hoping I'd get something in the low to mid 90's still for battery health, but I get a full day with moderate to heavy use so can't really complain about that.All in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the phone or BuySpry",2019年9月7日 在美国审核

Was leery to buy a used phone for the 1st time but totally worth it,"I bought a used iphone 8 and it was amazon certified. I opened it and saw no scratches or any damage whatsoever. I wanted to use it for a while before I did a review. I have had it about a month now and I havent had any issues at all with the phone's performance. Battery lasts a long time, no dropped calls and fast internet connection regardless of wifi/no wifi.I was so leery about getting a used phone. I've always gone new. When I saw it was only $200, it's worth a shot vs spending $800 on a new phone again. They gave me a 90 day return policy as well for the piece of mind. So far, this was the best bang-for-buck deal rather than buying a new phone. As long as I dont have any issues in the near future, I will continue to buy used phones from Amazon that are certified.",2020年4月6日 在美国审核

Battery health was 79% after opening it and using it for 2 weeks...did we check that status before...no.The seller says it should always be above 80% and will gladly refund, return and replace it or pay for battery replacement if I visit an authorized Apple store.I chose the easiest for everyone and scheduled a repair and replaced the battery.Seller not only reimbursed the total amount, it was actually more that the receipt I sent, maybe for my time and effort?In any case, totally happy with the purchase, completely satisfied with customer service and highly recommend this seller.Phone looked perfect and still acts 100%, like-new, 3 months later.",2021年3月10日 在美国审核

Like new,I was a little concerned by some of the reviews. I bought this for my daughter.The phone came with a charger in a generic box.The phone looks white to me but the order said silver. It came with a tempered glass screen protector already on.I have not seen any scratches or blemishes. I would count the phone in new condition.We took an ATT SIM card from a Samsung Galaxy S7 and plugged directly into the iPhone. It immediately worked with no issue.All features work and software is up to date.Battery life has been good. We have been using it for about 2 weeks so far.,2020年1月23日 在美国审核

Great phone,It came a couple of days before it was expected to which was great. Opened the box and it was just the phone and a charger like advertised. I’m very surprised at the look of it. The phone looks like it’s brand new. It works very great. It is unlocked and was easy just to pop in my sim from my iPhone 6s into this iPhone 8. I upgraded from the 6s to the 8 because I have had the 6s for 5 years now and never gotten it cracked or broken or anything and it works fine but in the last couple of weeks to a month now it seems like the 6s battery isn’t lasting as long after a charge so instead of finding a place to try to get it replace for god knows how much I figured it was time to upgrade my phone and now I’m glad I did.,2020年5月2日 在美国审核
Not worth the price.,"I thought this was a good buy but quickly found it had flaws.The first thing I had trouble with was it didn’t recognize my fingerprint even though I registered it several times.The same touch button was difficult to work.I had to touch several times to get it to work.Finally, in the middle of a conversation, my party could not hear me but I could hear them fine.It was like I muted it but it was not.At this point my 90 day warranty had expired two weeks ago.At $255.

Good value for money,"This iPhone 8 was great value for money. I do not use it as my primary cell phone, but as a house phone. The quality is great. The battery life is only 82%, so just over the 80% mark. This is not too much of an issue for me, as the phone stays on the wireless charger all the time. There is also a screen placed over the front of the phone, which is great, but as a result, the home button is not flush with the rest of the iPhone, with feels a little wired and takes some getting used to.

Beware of refurbished iPhones - Disappointed,"The good:1. The phone was delivered in a timely fashion just before Christmas.2. It looked perfect, no physical defects.The bad &amp; the ugly:1. I discovered the phone came from Japan where the camera sound cannot be turned off, by law. Took it to the Apple Store, and said they couldn't do anything about it. I take a lot of photos, and the loud click is a pain. But, that was a minor detail for the price.2. Most importantly, the phone locked up suddenly. The Apple Store couldn't unlock it. The only way was to wipe it clean to factory settings. Lost everything that wasn't stored in the cloud, including my photos. The phone has a 256 GB memory. Didn't want to bother with paying extra storage space in the cloud. Let's hope this doesn't happen again...

Poor Battery Health,"Phone looked great. However, battery health was promised to be greater than 80%.

NOT even enough to replace the battery, which I am going to have to do this week because it literally goes from 30% to dead in 10 minutes. Not very pleased.

No!,"The phone seemed well at first, all outside conditions were great other than minor scratches. But the phone would sometimes shut down as if dead when could be at high charge. When it would power back on it would say it was completely dead and would only let me be on it for a few minutes before restarting the pattern. Phone wouldn't charge during these moments so there was literally nothing i can do. And sometimes when the phone would do this is would go right back to its normal charge and work as normal until the sequence started back up. This was extremely annoying when i would be busy on my phone. One morning i woke up and the phone would not power on at all, even when tried charging with multiple chargers. I sent it to apple thinking this was a simple battery problem and i could pay a cheap $49 for a replacement but later got a message saying that the phone was completely defected an the problem was far beyond just the need of a battery replacement. Refunding immediately.",2019年11月16日 在美国审核

Terrific phone after a second delivery!,"The phone I have now works so well, it's in seemingly perfect condition! For what I paid for a used phone, I feel the seller deserves praise for the product at the end of the day. I wish I could give four stars. There were several communication issues/ product issues that I felt took this order in a wonky direction. 1.) The order was sent to my address with signature required. When I asked to remove the required signature (I'm not home all the time), the package was sent the next day to a location one state away. Rather than spend another four to five days without a phone, I chose to drive a half hour through a different state to pick up the package at the FedEx facility. Okay.2.) The first phone stopped working after a few weeks. Believe me, being without a phone for a few days can be a risky issue (I don't even have a phone at home, what if I had to call 911? My employer? Etc.) They gave me a VERY quick and flexible response, saying they would replace or return the phone. Amazing response! They told me to remove my iCloud info and delete the email app, which was impossible because it wouldn't even turn on, but no problem, they removed the iCloud account and email when I turned it in somehow. However, they did not mention that I would have to hold onto the SIM card!So they sent me a new iPhone, nice model, everything fine, except- no SIM card. 3.) No SIM card. By this time the world was in the middle of an epidemic crisis, my carrier was closed except for in one location (fine) but the carrier veritably chased me away yelling at me to call because they had no functioning service (not fine - no phone.) After all the drama I figured out how to call them without activation on my own. A few days later I got the SIM. Anyway, the NEW phone works outstandingly, the exchange was smooth, they were very fast at messaging and did a terrific job of offering me an exchange immediately with no extra fees. However the lack of notice about a signature requirement upon delivery, the first phone battery stopping completely, and the lack of communication about holding my old SIM card backed up my phone use. I'm all set now though. Four stars.",2020年4月16日 在美国审核

90 day return policy very good,"This was a beautiful phone and a very good price. Everything worked great on it, except, unfortunately, the sound. I could hear everything just fine, but people I called said I sounded like I had my head in a bucket. I ended up returning it, so it might seem strange that I am reviewing it, but just wanted to let buyers know that the 90 day return makes it easy to take a chance on a renewed phone. No questions asked, no tricky stipulations. Just make sure you keep all your original materials and stay within the 90 days. The next phone I bought seems to be perfect, other than it isn’t that cheerful red. I did subtract one star because I think it could have been more thoroughly checked out prior to sale.",2019年11月2日 在美国审核

Good so far!,"For those of you trying to suss out which seller is best through the aggregated reviews, I ordered my from Electro Wireless. The phone took about a week to ship out, but to be fair I ordered just before the Fourth of July and I can see how that would gum up the works. It arrived within a day of being shipped though, so that made up for it.The phone looks immaculate (no scratches or dents). So far I've had no issues (though it's only been 24 hours). I booted it up, put in my sim, placed calls, sent texts, changed display settings, tested the speakers with my music, etc....anything I could really think to test I did. The phone came with the tool to open the sim tray, a USB plug, and charge cable (the plug and cable are not Apple products, which I expected, but since some reviews act surprised, I'll confirm for those of you who think that really matters).There are two minor downsides. The battery capacity is only at 89% right now. While that's still entirely useable, at 80% the battery is essentially dead/needs replaced. So I've only got 9% to use, though I'm not sure how long that will take me to run down so maybe that doesn't matter. The second downside is they also send a tempered glass screen protector, BUT, it's unfortunately the wrong size. Not sure if it's for the 8S or a newer iPhone, but it sure isn't for the regular old 8. I ordered a case anyway, so it's not really an issue for me.",2019年7月11日 在美国审核

Battery is well over 85%. Great purchase so far. It came with a 90 day warranty. If any issues develop I’ll report with an updated review, but I anticipate all will be good.",2020年3月25日 在美国审核
Like new but….,Phone looks and works like a new phone. My only complaint is the batteryhealth came at 84%.

Vendor dies not honor their guarantee. Cannot be trusted.,After requesting a refund because the phone literally fell apart they said they would refund my money when they received the phone. Upon receipt they refused my refund because the phone was apart. Amazon refunded my money. DO NOT TRUST THIS VENDER. A repair shop told me it was missing various parts that actually held the phone together. I had the phone 2 weeks before it fell apart. Their guarantee says 90 days. It’s a great guarantee if nothing goes wrong with the phone,2020年8月31日 在美国审核
Phone arrived not working. Amazon Support was terrible,"I will never buy a phone from Amazon again. This is the upgraded refurbished phone you’d think it would have been fine or at least the support would’ve been good but the whole experience was terrible. As soon as it arrived the camera kept freezing on me then stopped working all together. Getting support was a joke. I spent over an hour total with two different support people walking me through every solution they could think of. Press this button, hold the sleep button, now try this and that and 100 other things. What a waste of time! I gave up and said can you send me a replacement and they never even acknowledge it just kept going with this and that to get it to work. I finally just submitted a return.

Doesn't work well on Verizon,The phone itself is fine. My issue is the fact that it was advertised as being unlocked for Verizon. It doesn't have signal.

Pretty Sure It's From Japan,"The camera will always make a shutter sound, even when on silent, which leads me to believe it was refurbished from Japan.

I purchased the phone in 2020 so I wouldn't be surprised if it needed a new battery by now.

I didn't test any other phone functions thus have no comments whether other features are in working order. Since the phone did not perform as described, I had to give it lower rating.

Used and refurbished iphone 8,"I got the 64Gb iphone 8 used and refurbished. It's unlocked, and my (att) sim card had no issues with the phone. All iphone 8's should have the capacity to take the various sim cards, so I wasn't too worried. The battery capacity is at 88%, which the seller advertised would be above 80% so they are true on their word. The phone looks good, it's clearly used, and the charger cable may not be genuine apple and the plug is definitely not an apple product. That's all in their description as well and I don't mind that at all.Overall I'm very please with the phone. It has only been a week, so it may be too early to tell. I will update if the satisfaction changes since some reviews report phones going dead within 3 months. Honestly if this phone holds, for 270, it's a great deal and I'll definitely buy again.Update: the previous review stays, however I am sending the phone back and deducting a star because I do not believe it was unlocked.

Defective. Not worth paying $380.,Received a defective phone:1. The boot screen would display a line either above or below the Apple logo occasionally. It would either show as a green line or a static line2. There was occasional lag when swiping through home screens and opening apps. I compared it to a friends iPhone 8 and the problem was specific to the phone I received3. The touch screen would not respond occasionally4. The battery would not display correct percentages. I once had the phone charging for 20 minutes and the percentage did not increase at all. After restarting the phone it showed the correct percentage.This also happened while using the phone — the percentage would not decrease until restarting the phone5. The speaker sound quality sounded poor compared to my friends iPhone 8,2019年6月13日 在美国审核

Great phone!,"I almost returned it after I couldn’t get it to read my SIM card. But after multiple attempts, a tiny piece of metal fell out onto my lap and I attempted once more to insert my SIM card into the phone and it slid right in, where as before it must’ve been being blocked by that tiny piece of metal, and the compartment that holds the SIM card wasn’t being inserted all the way and was actually protruding out of the phone, but it wasn’t that noticeable until i compared it both mine and my sisters iPhone, and those were both flush with the phone. I’m extremely happy with my purchase after that issue was resolved. I ordered the silver case, its white on the back side not silver, but I still like it. With a case on all u can see is the silver Apple and I guess the white makes it stand out, otherwise it doesn’t seem like it would. The circle around the home button is silver though.

Good Iphone8 fair price,"This phone arrived in pristine condition, like new. The setup took about an hour because the phone required IOS 14.1 to be installed before any data transfer was allowed.

Through blue tooth the phones do all the communicating. The only thing I needed was my Apple ID to log through the transfer and my entry phone from my old phone.The company that provided this phone literally had thousands of reviews and most favored 4 stars or better. Although the phone has only been with my one week, I am very pleased. I went through 3 Iphone8's to get this one. The quantity of reviews and the quality of reviews really sold me. Another plus is the company included their phone support number and a scanner code if I ran into trouble, which the other three companies did not supply.I added an Otter Symmetry case and a glass protector and overall am pleased.This is not a honeymoon feeling with the product, just very happy with the product in and of itself.",2020年11月3日 在美国审核

Hit or Miss,"11/21/2019I bought this phone in August, arrived in original packaging with an Apple charger- worked great with no problems! Like new, camera worked great, absolutely no issues. However, my phone got stolen from me at the end of October. So I ordered a second one- complete opposite experience. Came in a small, dirty box with some weird charger. Had obvious scratches on the screen, and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality. I had been waiting for 3 weeks to replace my phone so I gave it a shot anyway... the microphone did not work at all. When people called, I could hear them and they couldn't hear me- which I had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from AAA, who hung up on me upon my ""lack"" of response when I answered the phone. Took it to T Mobile and chatted online with Apple to do some troubleshooting- turns out it's just a bad refurbished phone, so the only answer was to return it. Disappointed overall- good luck with your order...12/2/2019Increasing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Still leaving off one star for the 1 busted up phone, and 1 star for the inconvenience and 3 weeks of waiting to replace my phone- as well as both times the shipping delayed, (however only by 1 day each time, but I think I should mention it since it is listed ""Prime FREE Delivery""). I ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone. THANK GOODNESS IT PAID OFF. I got another phone, quality as good as the first one. I leave this review after 1.5 weeks of phone 3 with no issues. I will update my review if anything changes but currently I am relieved it worked out.",2019年11月21日 在美国审核

A good renewed phone but not perfect.,"This renewed iPhone 8 arrived in good condition, there were no visible scratches and overrall the phone works great!<br>However, the battery does not hold up to the &gt;80% capacity claim, after a few days of first activating it, the battery declined from 80% to 77%, although the charge still lasts quite a bit. Also, this specific unit seemed to have had the screen replaced at some point in the past, considering the brightness and pixel density is definitely NOT what is expected of an iPhone. The phone works internationally and is not locked to any specific carrier. However I would've still loved for the seller to be more honest with the battery capacity claim.If you don't have the budget for a new iPhone but still want the Apple experience, I'd recommend you to go ahead and purchase one of these renewed ones.

No, in fact the phone had a protective film installed (probably by the original owner).- Is the battery in good shape? Sort of. Battery Health, Maximum Capacity reports 82%. That's the only disappointment. I imagine that battery health will vary.",2021年4月14日 在美国审核
Disappointed,"The product came with a scratch and little divet on the screen. When I first got it, it had a screen protector on, so I thought the screen protector had the divet- nope.After accidentally dropping it, my phone screen cracked right through the divet. I have not had this phone long and am pretty disappointed as It is not even usable now. Now the screen shows many lines of colors. I should have sent it back at the beginning when I saw the divet but was willing to work with it. Make sure you do your due diligence when you first buy it to send it back if there is any issues with the screen!It’s a true unlocked Apple phone. Worked with at&amp;t and Verizon (we switched carriers).",2019年4月25日 在美国审核

The listing stated battery health guarantees at least 80% and that is exactly what my phone indicated. So, I will have to get a new battery installed immediately to make my “new” phone useable. So, now I’m over $300 after the $60 battery replacement cost.

I have to insert and re-insert the Lightning wire several times, hold it just right, carefully place it at an angle and set a weight on the phone by the connector. Only then will it charge. Unfortunately, it is out of warranty and I'm sure it will be too expensive to fix. So I guess when I can no longer find the sweet spot to charge it, I'll look for another refurbished iPhone.On a side note, for my daughter, I bought an identical refurbished phone at the same time (different vendor, but I don't think that matters here), and it's working perfectly.",2020年12月19日 在美国审核

The rep also asked for my passcode, and when I explained what happened, he checked the number and said it was not an AT&amp;T number. He took my IMEI and ICCID numbers and was able to unlock my phone so I could call out without going automatically to that number.

Camera is broken sorta and touchscreen is too sensitive,I want to like this product but the calibration or something is messed up because the camera constantly shakes. I cannot take pictures because all of them shake and come out slightly blurry. Also the screen is so sensitive even when the screen is locked. I end up taking pictures while it is in my pocket.

Disappoi,For almost $200 iPhone 8 regular I thought was not too bad of a price I mean honestly I think it’s still high. But we needed a phone so I bought one for myself and one for my husband. Mine you’d have to have the charger adapter for to the phone set a certain way just so that it would stay charging. Half the time the charge would be down with his a few minutes. Not having. But there were no scratches no dents came in great condition. And like I do a lot of telemedicine and my doctors either couldn’t see me at the time or couldn’t hear me so that’s gonna go into a trade-in program or donated to veterans,2022年1月25日 在美国审核
It does not work on all carriers!,"I gave this phone a 1 only because the seller is not describing it properly.It is a gsm phone and, as such, does not work on Verizon or Sprint the same way a Verizon or Sprint phone will work.Those carriers use CDMA phones, so a gsm phone will not get the same coverage.It worked in as far as I could get it activated to make calls, receive texts and be fully functional, but only in certain areas.I had an iPhone6 &amp; an iPhone 4 before that, both with Verizon &amp; both of those worked all the time at my boyfriend's house &amp; never once lost service in 6 years.Then I bought this phone &amp; had service fine until I got to his house &amp; then my phone said ""no service"".It did this repeatedly for a few days every time I went to his house &amp; stayed that way the whole time I was there even though my boyfriend's Verizon iPhone 8 worked in the same house at the same time &amp; never lost service.I called Verizon &amp; they said this phone was a T-Mobile phone &amp; is a gsm phone &amp; explained that if I want the same level of coverage I had before I need an unlocked phone that was originally a Verizon phone so that it is a CDMA phone.I guess an original Sprint phone would work, too, since those are CDMA phones.I told Amazon that they need to require the sellers of cell phones to identify the phone as gsm or CDMA.",2020年2月8日 在美国审核

Ok at first but ended up being bad buy,"Phone was “renewed” but arrived looking brand new and with 100% battery capacity. Sadly, it has not turned out to be a good buy. Shortly after the return window closed, the phone began having audio and messenger issues. I am now only able to talk in short intervals of 1-5 minutes before the outgoing voice capability drops. I can still hear the person on my phone but they cannot hear me. A quick redial and all is ok again but only for a short time. First few times it happened, I could shutdown phone, power up and the problem would disappear for a few days. Not so any longer. Comes back as quickly as first call after power up. Haven’t been able to discern a pattern for length of call. Seems to randomly go out. Sometimes it will last 5 minutes, sometimes 45 seconds. iMessage also randomly converts to SMS. Quick restart seems to correct that issue but phone doesn’t seem to recover iMessage function without restart once it drops. Everything else seems to (at least right now) work as it should. Tired of dealing with it so I am back in the market for a new iPhone.",2021年6月17日 在美国审核

Honest opinion,"Hi guys, I got the phone, it was unlocked as advertised, no problem for my carrier and I am in Europe. The phone works good for me, I've had it for a couple of days, although the battery capacity is at 89%, it can hold up to 2, 2 and a half days with talking and surfing, no charging. It doesn't restart, as some comments here say, which was what I was worried about and really the value for money is great. Apart from a couple of dinges on the side, visually the phone was great, it even had a protector on. For the people complaining that the battery capacity is not at 100%, just go change it, it's like 20 bucks and don't forget this is not a brand new phone, so for a refurbished phone that I got I can say I am pleased.",2019年7月23日 在美国审核

PHONE'S IMEI NUMBER BLACKLISTED AS LOST/STOLEN,"The phone initially worked just fine and I was able to make a few phone calls after getting a sim card from my carrier.

The representative informed me that the phone's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number had been blacklisted as lost/stolen and that I would be unable to use the device until it had been removed from the blacklist by either Apple or Verizon (the former carrier). This is unacceptable considering I paid for a fully unlocked phone. On top of that, the headset speaker sounds tinny as if it was damaged from playing music too loudly.

The ups and downs of a renewed iPhone 8.,"Okay for beginners this would be a wonderful refurbished iPhone to start off with, you still got one of the greatest tech apple made, and the prettiest design... but for those of us who have more of a expectation then I would recommend buying new, you won’t get the best battery life in the phone industry, and with the device having been renewed you do lose things like battery capacity with the age of the device. Also buttons like mine will lose there tack-tile feed back and become more mushy and hard to detect if you pressed it or not. Last but not least the SIM card tray was handled with less then desired care as mine did come bent where you enter your sim tool into... all these problems can be fixed with off the shelf parts, but might cost you more the. You desire. Over all shipping was a great success and came early, device does come completely unlocked including iCloud unlocked, and does include a third party charger and power brick.",2021年3月3日 在美国审核

"Be careful of this ""certified and tested"" Amazon qualified supplier!","The camera sound (the “click” when you take a picture) cannot be muted, not even if you switch off the sound with the button on the left side and you activate the Silent Mode. I went to the Apple store to verify if it was a hardware issue and it could be repaired, but they said no: they informed me that this is not adjustable as the phone comes from Japan and this is one of those countries where the sound of the camera cannot be silenced. I found it extremely disappointing, as I would have never bought it if I knew in advance – and I am very surprised that this is an Amazon “certified and inspected product”: did not you realize while inspecting the phone that the camera sound could not be muted? At least you could have advised that in this particular device the sound could not be turned off.As a loyal customer of Amazon (Prime too) from several years now, I found it extremely shady: you sponsor a product as certified and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier and you should be transparent while describing the product and its specifications, given that Amazon is an international platform and your buyers are based all around the world. I am based in the USA and knowing that the product would have come from Japan and the camera cannot be silenced, I wouldn’t have completed the purchase but switched to a different supplier.This is a lack of primary information that should have been disclosed by Amazon and would have guided and helped me in the purchasing process.Lastly, the battery is weak – it lowers down very quickly and I have to charge it at least three times a day.",2020年3月1日 在美国审核

I read the negative reviews about the battery life not lasting and thought that was just part of owning refurbished. But wow, this is RIDICULOUS. Do not buy from this seller.<br>The iPhone 8 generation itself seems like a good buy if you want something newer (I did, because I had an iPhone 6 so I needed an upgrade). I've always bought refurbished and factory reset, because I've always been thrifty and as a now stay-at-home mom of two I need to be thrifty on a budget. I also need a reliable phone when I'm home alone with both kids or out driving and god forbid need to make an emergency call. Anyways- to the point- saving money was not worth this piece of garbage. It worked great for about six months. I bought the phone at the end of March- it's now mid October and the phone will not work unless it's plugged directly into the charger. If I take said phone off the charger- even at 100%- within minutes the phone dies. So now I don't have a phone and cannot afford to replace it, because in my house $300 is a lot of money. I would just advise carefully researching and do not choose this seller.</br>",2021年10月12日 在美国审核

Phone battery was only at 80% but phone is working fine,"So far so good! The only qualm I have about this is that the battery was at 80% capacity, which is when Apple recommendations replacing it, so I had to spend an additional $70 to get a replacement put in at a local store since I need a phone and sending it in and waiting for it to get back to me isn't an option.

Better than a iPhone 7,"For those who are on the fence about upgrading to a refurbished iPhone 8, this product works just like it should! For a phone that is.

Watch out for third party screen replacements,"My daughter’s renewed phone had weirdly washed out colors with a blue tint to the screen. Found out that cheap third party after-market screen replacements are (unsurprisingly) not nearly as good Apple’s original screens, and you can find out which yours is if under Display &amp; Brightness there’s a toggle for True Tone. Sure enough, no True Tone option on her new phone. My eyes are too used to the vibrant screens to be comfortable with the weird ones, but they accepted my return without problem. Bought a renewed one from a different company on Amazon, and this one had True Tone. If this is something that’s going to bother you, beware.

Needed a Battery Replacement Done,"It was still a good value.

Settings, the app itself recommend servicing.So I took it's advice and got the battery replaced at an apple certified bestbuy near me. Luckily they had the battery in stock and it was done in a few hours. The service cost $49+tax. They informed me that apple's replacement iPhone 8 (which is actually new and was circulated for the purpose 'totaled' claim replacements/insurance) was $350.At the end of the day, I have a phone that functions just as new and I came across it a tad under 80 bucks less than brand new sealed package iPhone 8.

Unexpected strong disappointment with “renewed” IPhone 8.,"I purchased this renewed iphone8 in December 2020 for my wife to replace a very old previous one. It’s operation has been far less than consistent owing to increasing occurrence of dropped calls, inability to reach attempted calls, and generally declining performance. I purchased this phone on the basis of having a great experience with buying a renewed iPhone 8 Plus from Amazon.Anyway, we’ve had this phone since December 2020 knowing it is technically past a warranty/return, but nevertheless, given my very long and strong status as an Amazon customer, I’m hopeful some form of remedy may be possible for this failing phone.",2021年5月15日 在美国审核

Performance Yes Appearance Iffy,"I have a love hate relationship with Apple. I will not buy a new product from them ever. Why? They brick phones with updates. That's shady. They smile while they do it too. So? Well it matters because that makes me a repeat customer of these second hand phones. Prices seem to be set competitively so that doesn't affect my choice of where my cash goes. What does have some weight in my decision making is customer service. I pay the asking price I get a device as advertised. Simple enough right? You would be surprised or maybe you wouldn't. The local places offering these devices have people behind the counters that don't seem to get what good customer service is. So.... okay. Get to the point right? I got a phone that works as advertised at a good price and I didn't have to deal with anyone so that's a plus. However, the appearance of the item was ummm .... acceptable had they not been sloppy in a weak attempt to cover up a blemish on the surface of the screen with a very cheap slapped on at the last second screen protector. The peeled backing of the protector was discarded into the corner of the box looking confused and I'm sure feeling slightly used.Have I mentioned it prior to this post? Nope. It really wouldn't matter had it not been so obvious of a weak attempt to cover something that wasn't as expected. Customer Service guys. Don't just don't. Will I buy another when the time comes?

PLEASE READ,"This is going to be an accurate, unbiased review of the phone, so hear me out.<br>The phone's that are received by each person will most definitely be different. My experience went as follows.Upon receiving the phone the right side of the screen was popping up a little, and if it was pushed down into the phone it would cause a blemish to appear in the middle of the phone. No biggie, I just need it to perform basic actions and not die. Here's where the second issue comes in to play. Upon receiving the phone the battery was already at 70% integrity. After the 90-day warranty that integrity was below 50, and now my phone has turned off and refuses to charge. I still have my old phone so this isn't too much of an issue, however now I'm out 240+ dollars and an iPhone.I realize beggars can't be choosers, but you're honestly much better off getting a refurbished phone from a store.</br>",2020年6月11日 在美国审核

Make sure to thoroughly test phone on arrival,"Pros: Everything looked great (much better than expected like new, 83% battery health). little to no scratches on screen even looking at it close up.Cons: I went to make a call and the earpiece isn't audible on max volume so I have to return/exchange. I wasted a few hours setting up the phone and return process isn't the super smooth qr code drop off .You must hunt down a printer (who has one of those these days!) and affix the label yourself.Maybe avoid unless you have a gambler's personality like me with too much time on your hands? There is a non-zero chance the exchange I get will also have a problem if they aren't even checking if you can make a call and hear the person on the other end. Everyone is different and if you get a great deal go for it, just realize you might have to return it for something more than just regular wear but a functional issue.",2021年6月29日 在美国审核

The speaker to hear anything is so quiet I highly regret buying this phone ):,I didn’t leave my house for the 2 years bc Covid and bought this iPhone bc I was about to be leaving again and needed a phone. This was a huge mistake. I didn’t start using the phone till about a month ago so I didn’t notice that the speaker sucks. When I get phone calls or call out it’s so freaking quiet even on what should be loud speaker phone. The battery life is absolutely amazing but the speaker to hear doesn’t work so this phone is useless to me. I am older and don’t need much phone use but to call when i really need to but this phone does not fulfill that job. Super duper sad bc the return window is closed which is stupid. If you are going to buy this phone don’t just assume that since everything else works that the speaker will be loud. Oh also the bottom of the touch screen doesn’t work so I have to use the talk to text bc the space bar doesn’t work and the bottom row of letters. I do not recommend!!<br>Updated: the phone no longer charges.</br>,2022年3月22日 在美国审核

Bad Amazon Prime Services on this Renewed Device !!!,"This product is Renewed by Amazon but is sold by a third party vendor. I received the IPhone and attempted to set it up from transferring from another IPhone. During the Process it required me to update the software from 14.1 to 14.4. Doing so 'locked up' the IPhone to the point Restore or Updating was useless. I called the seller and notified them of the issue. I was told I would have to Return the item and Buy a new IPhone to replace this Defective unit. This is where it gets crappy. I submitted the online return thru Amazon and labeled the item as Defective with description and printed of the shipping label, only to find out that the shipping label requires the Purchaser to PAY return shipping, even though the product is defective. I called Amazon Renewed number because they 'guarantee' 100% customer satisfaction, and I was told that I will need to go out and pay for return shipping, call Amazon back with the amount, and then will have to mail-in the receipt to be reimbursed. Not really sure if this is what is meant be 100% customer satisfaction if I have to do all this work for a Defective product.Do yourself a favor and buy only from Amazon Prime and Free Return shipping.

Apparent faulty facial proximity sensor from the first use.,"Poor refurbishment; it appears that the proximity sensor was faulty despite the phone being approved by 'quality control'.All kind of interesting things were occurring on my newly refurbished iPhone 8 from the first phone call to all subsequent phone conversations.The screen was staying active and illuminated when I was speaking with someone and I found myself often explaining to others that I hang-up on them, muted them, sent them a random pic, etc... with my face.The phone was returned and my money was returned as well.I understand that it happens occasionally but it was a waste of time that was a gift to my mother for xmas.Another was purchased from a different refurbished and it works just like you'd expect an iPhone 8 to perform.",2021年2月21日 在美国审核

"NO Manual, NO Sim card, NO Customer Service","These phones require a special sim card - something you won't know unless you spend three days online with your service provider troubleshooting the phone. I paid $5 at one Boost store. Wrong sim card. Bought another one at a full Boost dealer and the card was $15, but required another $26 to activate/change my plan. Oh, but it didn't end there. The Boost agent didn't enter my address, phone number or email address - all things my internet security relies on. It's been a week now and I'm STILL trying to get Apple to release my password on this phone so I can get into my Internet accounts - which are MY BUSINESS. I have two-factor authentication activated and THAT relies on a PHONE that is properly working. No idea how much it's cost me in lost time, customers, and money.Customer service is poor to nonexistent as they believe once they sell you the phone it's up to you to figure out how to activate, what SIM card (5G) to buy and so on. They do NOT include a manual, or even a one page QuickStart facts about your phone. Cost to them? PENNIES to print out the simple facts you need to get started.It's a nightmare.

Phone died after 4 months exactly.,"Phone died after 4 months exactly. Went to an Apple store as well as to an independent lab. Both said battery change won't help and nothing can be done.

We have to follow the policies and procedures under the Amazon renewed program in order to be able to sell on this platform. Amazon will not even allow you to send the device back because it is out of warranty and we have no control over this nor can we circumvent the system.""So either the seller did not renew the phone properly, or it's amazon's fault and their ""Amazon renewed"" program is bad.

Disappointment (you get what you pay for),"In the end, this was a headache. At first it seemed to be okay, but when I went to check battery health, it was below the 80% that they committed to. I asked for a replacement battery, and I had to keep reminding them until it finally came after 1 month. But it was worthless; they sent a battery that did not keep charge for very long. So finally, since I had already had all my software installed etc., I just bought a new battery ($50 added to the price).Had that been the only thing I would have been OK. But a few weeks ago, after just 6 months of use, the WiFi stopped working. So now I'm buying an altogether different unit. In other words, I was penny wise and dollar stupid.A much better deal seems to be buying not the ""renewed"" but rather the ""renewed premium"", which comes with a 1-year warranty and an battery guaranteed to be at 90% or more. But you can probably end up being unlucky there too.",2022年4月21日 在美国审核

I submitted a request for a replacement, which has now canceled out 2x even after contacting Amazon directly.

Meeehhh!!!,This product came in good shape but with a completely bad battery. The phone would work until you got to around 50% and the. Would randomly shut off! I had to buy a battery 1 day after I received it and it cost me another $70.00... I bought the 2 year warrant and paid an extra $70.00 for that! I use my phone for business and don’t have time to send it in for warranty so I just paid outta pocket to prevent the inconvenience. I am always worried about buying used things online for this exact reason. With that said the phone works perfect after the new battery was installed.

Battery was a dud making the phone unusable and a non-responsive seller.,"I will admit that I did not open the box and use the phone until 94 days after purchase. My wife got during Christmas time as it was a good price and gave it to me for Vday. That said, it had battery issues right from the get go. Unfortunately, it was past the 90 day window for the Amazon warranty. I reached out to the reseller but heard nothing back. Long story short, the phone is unusable unless I take it to the Apple store and get a new battery. It goes from 98% to 54% in a matter of 3 minutes. Battery health from settings says your battery health is significantly degraded and to replace it. This should not happen 95 days after purchase and honestly in my case 1 day after actually beginning to use it. Stay away from this reseller.",2022年2月25日 在美国审核

I called and explained the situation to these guys, and they couldn't get me off the phone fast enough. Since we were out of warranty, they just said ""nope, no exceptions."" I understand that technically they don't have to work with us to solve the problem, but seriously, in this day and age, great companies who care about customer service will be reasonable and help find a solution. I'm even willing to pay a little for them to swap out phones, but they were completely dismissive and rude to me on the phone and 100% unwilling to help. I'd recommend taking your chances buying a phone with another company. If you ever run into any problem, these guys clearly have zero interest in doing the right thing.

Hi,"The phone could of been a nice phone but I had to take the simCard from my iPhone 7S and install it into the newer iPhone 8 , it caused the 8 to have all of the same problems that I was replacing the 7s for .

I thought it would of come with a new SIM card but since it didn’t I have a newer phone that has all the old phone problems . So was really a waste of my money . Idk whose fault this was? I dk if it’s a defect in the I phone 7s or the 8? Idk how to go about getting a new SIM card and who to get it from bc the 8 didn’t come with oneso the man who sold me the iPhone 8 prob doesn’t owe me one so not sure who I get one from .to put into the8 tofix it .",2021年11月28日 在美国审核

Waste of money.I have replaced the SIM card with a new one, but that makes no difference. The cellular connection repeatedly goes from 4 bars to no service without me moving around. I cannot make a phone call without the connection dropping. The battery lasts takes less than an hour if I use Safari on a WIFI connection. if I am using the phone. And the charge port is so loose, charging the phone is unreliable. Attempted to get a resolution from the seller, but the seller hides behind their 90 day return policy. Never again will I purchase a phone like this. Better off dealing directly with Apple or Verizon.

Not a good working phone.,After purchasing this as a spare (I travel frequently) 11 months ago I finally found myself in a situation where I needed it. After unboxing it all seemed well... Until I went to use it. The service is absolutely horrible and it constantly dropps calls and shows 1 bar of service where my previous IPhone 8 that I purchased from apple worked perfectly.

Sketchy quality refurbished devices,"Got the phone in July, but was not able to begin using it until August due to the carrier failing to unlock the device before sending it out to us. After numerous trips to the T-Mobile store, eventually we had the employees call CellCow and ask them to unlock it - which they claimed they had already done, but until we called they could not add the line to my account.Fast forward to October and the entire phone dies. We eventually took it in to an apple authorized repair specialist and they informed us that it seemed like the logic board just died.Reached out to CellCow and they refused to do anything as it was outside of the 90 day amazon guarantee window. Waste of $360~ or so for what is essentially now a paperweight.Overall I wouldn't suggest doing business with this company unless you're willing to risk devices breaking JUST outside of the warranty window and dealing with poorly handled device unlocking.",2021年12月6日 在美国审核

An unusable item that turned out to be stolen,"The phone I purchased proved to be unusable as it was stolen and blacklisted from network use. When I contacted support, they simply did not acknowledge that the phone was stolen, and after three days simply asked if I'd received shipping labels to send it back, which I took as a tacit admission that they are well aware many of their renewed phones are from unscrupulous sources. I never actually received the shipping labels to send it back anyways.I strongly advise anyone reading this review to head over to another seller because this one has not proven very dependable, at least for me.

Misleading Product Description,"Not Happy with this “renewed” IPhone 8 from AE Cells. According to Amazon, this should be like new, but all 4 corners have damage. The back is heavily scratched. The screen has been replaced with an aftermarket product. The battery health is at 80%, barely meeting the minimum requirement. There’s nothing about this phone that is like new or refurbished. It just looks like someone’s old beat up used phone. Amazon needs to either change the product description or get rid of some third-party sellers.",2020年3月12日 在美国审核

This is a well made specimen of this species and I will very happily recommend them,"There are 10 of these in the pack. They fit perfectly well with my iPhone.I tested their sturdiness by trying to bend them and found that unless you are wilfully trying to bend them, they will retain their shape. This means that you can leave one of these in your wallet, along with the coins, and they will not lose their shape. Particularly handy if you travel and need to change your SIM cards.The surface is well rounded unlike some cheaper products. There is no chance of cutting yourself with these.All in all, these days it is perhaps the simplest 'tool' in the world — a piece of metal used to push! This is a well made specimen of this species and I will very happily recommend them. As there are 10 of these in the pack, you can afford to lose a few here and there.

About 1mm short from being able to do the job.,"Bought a pack of these after I realized the one I had on my key ring had disappeared just in case I might need one at some random future time. Random future time occurred when I found an SD card I had forgotten while setting up new tabs for my sister's kids and thought this was as good a time as any to test the tabs' SD-card slot and these replacement tray ejectors.Well, these pins are too short to make the tray pop out far enough to grab. With some extra force, the opposite side may come out barely enough to slip a fingernail behind the tray's edge to pry it out some more. Need at least an extra 0.5mm to be really usable, 1mm for comfort.Also, while the ejectors may be sturdier than I expected for how thin they are, a tiny bit more thickness for stiffness wouldn't hurt.",2021年10月19日 在加拿大审核

Fantastic Value! Great Phone!,"I am impressed! I'm not a smartphone expert. This is my first, although I've helped my wife with her Android and her Iphone 5. I have built many computers and I am an IT specialist who provides help to others at work, but I had no real need for a smartphone. Most of the time, I sit in front of both work laptop and home desktop. However...friends had Blu phones and loved them, and I know all flavors of Windows, and I like the idea of sharing all my stuff between computer/tablet/phone/Mom's laptop, so I bought this. Runs everything quickly. Beautiful. Thin. Bright Yellow! Comes with flexi rear protector case, hands-free buds/microphone, installed screen cover and an extra and charging gear. Holds two sims, one micro, one mini. Unlocked. I like WP 8.1. Performs flawlessly with email, texts, calls, surfing, GPS, navigation. All this for $179. Stupid good value. For less than $200, I have something that outperforms my wife's Iphone 5. I've paid more for a meal for four. I'm a value-obsessed (read: CHEAP) person, and someone finally made a phone for me. I absolutely recommend this phone for anybody who wants a great value with everything you really need. Thanks for reading this!",2014年10月3日 在美国审核
From an iOS User,"My previous phones were Apple's 3GS and 5S. I develop software for many platforms including mobile devices but as a user, I'm not into tinkering/jail-breaking/customizing my phone experience. I just want it to work as an appliance. Also, I don't take a lot of pictures/videos with phones. I'm a long-time hobbyist photographer and have the cameras and lenses for that passion. I don't even make a ton of calls. I use a cell phone for consuming information and content mostly. I'm also a cheapskate, I can no longer justify over $500 for an unlocked phone, that's just me.So I sold my Apple 5S as the 6's came out and got a great price from a buddy. I tried getting by with my iPad 3 LTE but there are times when I just didn't want to lug it around. I really needed something decent and cheap. I have extensively used all the major modern phone platforms including iOS, Windows, Android, Blackberry - in that order of preference.I was surprised to see such a highly spec'd device for so little money, especially unlocked. I took a chance and I am surprised by what a nice phone this is. Here's my pros and cons:Pros1. Great screen - highly saturated colors, extremely bright, wide viewing angles and great resolution.2. Responsive - tapping, scrolling, flipping, rotating screens are all quite snappy and lag-free.3. Very good call quality with a loud and clear speakerphone.4. Comes with case and two screen protectors. They are decent enough that you can just get by with what's included.5. Dual SIM support - not something I need but kind of a bonus, especially for the price.6. Battery life seems adequate. After a work day of constant use, my phone is still at 70%.7. Windows GUI - I like it A LOT. It is very slick and didn't take me long at all to transition to it for daily use. But keep in mind I work with mobile platforms as part of my job so I tend to adapt to new systems quicker than an average user.8. Decent earbuds.9. Specs - 1GB RAM, quad core processor and GPU. Very good for the price. Perhaps omitting the LTE chipset and associated licensing fees helped put more money towards the rest of the build.10. Value - I cannot fathom how they can sell this phone for such a low price. Bona Fide Bargain.Cons1. Lack of app support. Hey it's not iOS or Android, so you've got to be willing to accept this fact. Google and Microsoft aren't the best of friends so you're not likely to find great integration with Google's services.2. I understand the screen is not Gorilla Glass, meaning more likely to scratch, nick and crack.3. No LTE support, so no Verizon. Not a big issue for me as I prefer T-Mobile and this device supports up to 42 Mbps downloads.4. Back cover is quite thin and feels like it can be easily bent if you're not careful. Popping it on and off feels risky as if the tabs might snap.Unknowns1. Camera performance for stills and videos. The iPhone 5S was pretty great here, with slow motion and panorama shots of exceptional quality. But even then, I didn't use the 5S camera after the first week. Taking pictures with my phone is just not my thing.2. Gaming - again, I love to play games, just not on a phone or even my iPad. I need physical controls and real display.3. Durability - this is a concern given the price. I hope it lasts.In summary, this phone is way better than it has a right to be at this price.",2014年11月27日 在美国审核
Said I'd never own another Windows phone.  Never say never!,"I've only been using it a couple of weeks, but so far so good!This is my second Windows phone.After the first one I swore I'd never have another, but I'm giving it another try.My other one was a N 520 W8.It exemplified everything I've long been bothered by with Windows.I hadn't had it long when it started spontaneously rebooting.Middle of a phone call - reboot.Reading an ebook - reboot.Looking at a map - reboot.No rhyme nor reason to it, just like a Windows computer.(No hate, please, I've been using Windows since 3.1 and I've lived through what I'm talking about!)But my fancy Android phone decided that it couldn't connect to its own camera any more.Repair shop wouldn't touch it, sent me to T-Mobile, who wouldn't touch it and sent me to Wal-Mart, who said I'd have to send it to ...So much for the warranty!I started looking for a new phone.I certainly wasn't expecting to get another Windows phone, but I saw it in the Microsoft Store and I liked the form and size, and I liked the price.So now I'm the proud owner of a new Blu Win HD!I'm just hoping that the 8.1 OS works better than the 8 did!Setting the home screen up wasn't really difficult.When I gave MS my phone number while registering it, they pulled out the setup I'd had on the Nokia and put it on for me.All I had to do was update it a bit.Uninstalled a few apps, installed a few others, sized and arranged a bunch of tiles, and it was ready to use.The tone quality is very good, both receiving and at the other end too.The ear phones that came with it are good, but the Skull Candy set I have is better.About what you'd expect.Battery life so far is not bad.It'll go a couple of days, but I'm not a Millennial power user, either!Because of the screen size, I am using this for more things than I have on any other phone, even including some light surfing.The interface is pretty easy to work with, so I'm using the Calendar now, something I've never done.Having a dedicated tile on the Home Screen is so convenient!! It's also nice not having to carry a planner anymore.The silicone skin that's included is ... nice.It's not armored by any means, but it provides a good grip.Only nit with its use is that the USB/charger access hole is smaller than the microUSB connector, so it's kind of tricky getting the plug in right and making sure it charges and stays charging.I haven't used the camera much, but the pictures look good for what I want to do with them.If I want to do serious photography, I have a serious DSLR.For a convenient camera, this one is just fine by me!Overall, so far my experience with it has been all positive.",2015年5月26日 在美国审核
It is worth only half the price they are asking for !!!! Spend your money on a actual durably phone BY BLU!!! OR ANOTHER PHONE.,I had this phone for a year til my dog got a hold of it lol. let me tell you the pros and cons!PROS_ #1: It has a huge screen the screen is a perfect size. #2:Cortana is better then siri from the i phones in my opinion and can do more. #3: You can customize it to how you like your phone to be set up. #4: The battery life lasted me a whole days even with heavy video streaming. #5: TheBACK camera had a GREAT picture looked very professional like very nice crisp pictures I got from it. #6: The phone was easy to use and run apps on. #7: the color is eye popping loved the color (PINK) would show pic but like I said my dog got a hold of it. #8: The instructions where great to help you get started. #9: The buttons where in good places that didn't make it confusing- the screen looked HD like it said in the description the images where always crisp and clear. #10:8 gb of storage was enough for me could hold a good 130 pics for me including the apps I had downloaded :)NOTE-(The phone case fit and was the same color as the phone ONLY THING IS ITS MADE OF LATEX I'M PRETTY SURE BECAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO LATEX AND IT BROKE ME OUT I had to take the case off and throw it away but as you will read in cons this was a bad idea! .but if your not allergic to latex then you should be fine.)CONS_ #1: The windows 8.1 itself was a pain in the butt updating all the time. #2: My phone would shutoff still even after they fixed it but it wasn't as frequent. #3: After 10 months of having my phone I started to notice when I would go on the web my screen would go slightly to the left which left me having to keep refreshing the page or I would only be able to see 3/4 ths of the page. #4: This phone is made of plastic so I advise to keep the case on at all times and a screen protector it cannot take a hit or fall to anything. #5: The FRONT camera sucks very badly its not even worth opening for a selfie or anything its very low quality. #6: The speaker on the phone was great til about 9 months and it started to cut in and out and didn't have the high tech sound it had when I first got it also the head phones you get are very uncomfortably and are cheaply made. #7: You can't find cases for it any where !! as I had noted it broke my hands out very badly where they looked like they where sunburn and my skin peeled a little so I didn't have a case on it which of course lead to it getting scratched a little and me having to baby it !OVERALL I NEED A NEW PHONE !! BLU HAS OTHER PHONES AT BETTER PRICES WITH BETTER REVIEWS I SUGGEST YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE. I WILL BE GETTING THE SAME BRAND BY BLU JUST NOT THE WINDOWS ONE AND FIND A UNIVERSAL CASE.,2016年4月23日 在美国审核
"Something to Rival everything else, for a fraction of the price","This is broken into a few parts, so pick through what you need:Reason for Purchase:I bought this phone because my previous phone was old and I needed a new one. I have had two Windows Phones before, and I was most impressed with my first one.Why THIS Windows Phone?This is a question I am often asked in public. They see my phone, one which I see very few other people have, and ask, ""why not an Android, or an iPhone, or even a better Windows Phone?"" Four years ago, I got a Nokia 710, one of the first Windows Phones. It ran on Windows 7, or their version for the phone, and it was smooth as hell. It was my first foray into the world of smart phones. I love that phone so much, that when, two years later, I dropped it and shattered the screen, I was devastated. To be honest, I would have bought five other versions of that phone to keep forever, because it was so simple and good. Anyway, I then got a Nokia 521, a cheap version of the 520, and was relatively happy with it for a few months. Then Windows 8.1 came along, and my phone went from okay to unresponsively slow in a few days. Because I didn't have the money to buy a new phone, I kept it until a few weeks ago, when the power button went out. I was both happy (that I could finally get something better) and anxious (because I didn't want to spend a lot and I didn't know where to look).What I was looking for:I wanted something familiar; something I could pick up and get right into, almost without missing a beat. So I kinda wanted a Windows Phone, but I've been wary of their decline in the last year or two. I also wanted something which wouldn't break the bank, and also looked nice as well. In addition, I didn't want to start a new contract.What do I like about the Win HD:While I've only had the phone for a few days, I can already pick out a few of my favorite things:- it does calling and texting well. A staple for any cell phone, and by that merit, it's already passed the cell phone test- the screen size is great, and doesn't go over into the phablet category- it's also a thin phone, giving that nice, sleek look- it's got a flash, which is a great bonus for when you need it for photographing, or when you just need a flashlight- the camera is decent on this phone. As an artist, I like to document my work over time, and I don't need a 13 MP camera on my phone, but I also want to make sure my images are relatively clear. This phone does that very well.- it has a simple, graphic UI. Windows Phones have always been this way, but they are very well designed and don't make you feel like you're using something with a stick up it's ass. It doesn't beat around the bush here, and I like that.- it's responsive. This is a big thing I noticed in my last phone, when they release Windows 8.1, and the new OS update killed my phone's responsiveness. I'm HOPING that this will not happen with my Win HD.- it comes with some nice accessories out of the box: a charger block and cable (a must, really), headphones (which I haven't seen included with a phone in awhile), a screen protector (and a good one, at that), and a silicon case (it won't protect against super nasty falls, but it does keep the case from scratching), and of course the directions.What I'm Not Crazy About Just Yet:- Cortana. She's still in her Beta form, but works pretty well. It's like Siri, but a bit more stripped down, and I'm okay with that. The thing that's weird is that, for the most part, I am able to search just as fast by typing as I am just saying it to her. However, the more I dabble with it, the better it'll be, perhaps.- I don't like that I'm stuck with the additional tiles, which were introduced with 8.1. I wish I had the option to put it back to the original, two column design.- the speaker on this thing is not that great. So if you plan on playing music from your phone, get a pair of headphones or an external speaker.- The color vibrancy on this phone also is lacking. My two previous Windows Phones had an option to change the color temperature and vibrance of the screen, and this one does not. This may be introduced in a later update, but for now are missing.- adding custom ringtones is a pain, so if you know where to look for them, or are okay with the default ones, ignore this. But I like my custom ones.- One BIG glaring defect of the Windows Phone is the lack of apps on their marketplace. Because of this, there are many third party apps, which are not bad, but are not fantastic either. If this is something that worries you, check below, as I have a list of my favorite apps I use on my phone. - - - These are all very nit-picky things, but they do stick out to me as negatives, so I felt I would list them.- - -Overall:This is a great, cheap Windows Phone which does a great job asked of a smart phone. I you've never used one before, they're very easy to get used to.My Favorite Apps:- 6tag: this is a third party Instagram app, and it is WAY better than the one Insta makes for Windows Phone- #1 Toolkit: need a flashlight, or a mirror, or a protractor? Maybe even an accelerometer or a level? This app has all of those and many more.- Camera Sight: The stock camera app on WP is very lacking in terms of changing presets and filters. This one does that well and is responsive, too.- Flipboard: A great way to see news articles without subscribing to a service.- Wunderlist: THE best place to make lists of all the things you need done. And it's cross-platform compatible.- VGBC8: Basically, Virtual Game Boy Color. Ever wanted to play those awesome Game Boy games, but lost the console or games? Well, if you're handy with emulator files (use at own risk), you can run those files through VGBC8. It's a great way to play Pokemon.- And as always, there are the standard apps made by the developers, which do run very well; Pandora, Spotify, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, Weather, Skype (already installed), Dropbox, Amazon, etc.",2016年2月17日 在美国审核
Well worth the money! Every cent of it and More!,"There are so many things that I liked about this product, that it is an easy spend for me. Here are the Pros and Cons:Pros:* Screen resolution is fantastic. I really wanted my phone to be 1920x1080, but even if this phone is not, the ppi is high enough to give a crispy look.* Bought myself a 32gb Micro SD card, I have been able to load most of my apps and songs without any problems.* The device has dual SIM card, which is quite useful as I travel quite a bit internationally, and don't have to sit at airports and change SIM cards.* Speaker on this phone is quite good! To a point where I listen to music just like that! (without even headphones)* Battery life is superb! Fully charged phone with about 40 - 50 minutes of call and the data line ""ON"" all the time, lasts for about 2-1/2 to 3 days. [Yes, I prefer to use Cell phone only for the purposes of quick communication and not as a long time use device for phone calls. That is what land lines are for :-) ]* Windows 8.1 Phone works very well on this device.* Comes with the Gel Cover, which really protects the device and fits snuggly. No need to spend another $10-$15 on that.* Looks very nice too, thin and weighs very less! People do take attention to the phone!Cons:* The processor is a low-end processor which does affect the performance when dealing with laborious tasks. (for example, when using OWA, if there are 200+ mails on the inbox unread, zooming in or zooming out takes a few seconds of delay (whereas, I don't see that issue in my Nokia 920). Similar problem when using ""swipe"" keyboard.* Doesn't support LTE, which reduces its use for me when I am in US (AT&amp;T Network)* I am not sure how the device software update is going to work, will have to wait and see -- since it is not carrier attached.Overall, great worth, and would whole heartedly recommend to any one!",2015年4月22日 在美国审核
First Impressions,"I bought this to replace my Nokia Lumia 520 mainly because of the Dual SIM feature, so I'm already familiar with Windows Phone 8.First Impressions (12/7/2014). Around 1 week of ownershipPros1. BIG Screen when compared to my tiny Lumia 520.2. Dual Sim. SIM 1 is Micro. SIM 2 is Mini (regular big size phone sim)3. Big battery4. Does not come with Bloatware5.....But does come with freeware in the form of a screen protector, case, headphones. I'm sure you seen this in everyone else's review.6. The screen is good to the touch response.Cons1. Vibrate isn't strong2. Touchscreen is basically unusable when it is charging. You basically have to mash the screen for the touch to register. Otherwise, you just have to uncharge the phone for a few seconds to use the phone and charge back.3. I don't really like the back cover. It is very secure to the phone with click locks all over, but the cover itself is thing and a pain to put back on.4. Can sometimes double touch when scrolling.5. Low Brightness doesn't feel low at all. (I did compare it to my Lumia 520).6. Placement of Power Button. I would like it lower. Sometimes accidental screenshots occur when pressing the power button and Up Volume button at same time.7. When scrolling, it can sometimes be slightly skippy.The accessories1. The screen protector they have already installed on the phone is a fingerprint magnet. And I don't really l like the feel of this type of screen protector. I prefer the Armor Suit Military Shield types.2. The headphones aren't really good quality.3. I got the Orange version of the phone. The case is of a light orange color. I wish that the case was clear so the original phone color can be seen. I prefer using the case as it makes the phone thicker so it doesn't feel like I will drop the phone.Verdict: The cons, in my opinion, weren't so bad that I would get another phone. As a Windows fan, I appreciate the Windows 8.1 OS, and the big screen at a budget price of only $150. Dual SIM in my case is THE reason why I bought this phone.----------------------------------------------------------------------Update 12/20/2014: Windows 8.1 Update 1 was installed. It seems touch response is much better, mainly fixing the problem with touch response when charging.Update 1/27/2015: After having this for two months. Two things stand out. The low/automatic at night brightness setting is too bright at night, for example looking at phone before sleep. Second, sound settings aren't so loud, headphones or speakers. And no I don't blast music.",2014年12月8日 在美国审核
"The worst part is finding the right specifications &amp; close, 15 Dec 2014 update","Note: I am putting that last notations first, closing this commentary. 15 December, in the end I sent back the HD ;/The audio volume up key stop functioning.This is a big deal if you need to do a print screen. Thevolume and power physical buttons become theprint screen buttons, there's no alternative mapping possible.I became attracted to spending the "" big money"" on the Blu after I fell into repairing a windows 7.0 phone [Lumia].After repair, it had updated itself to version 7.5, which was intriguing.Then it updated itself to windows phone version 8.0.It was this versionthat made me realize what I was missing.As Blu HD was not announced early Nov,2014,I got one of the cheap Lumia 635 units.Seeing this low end windows phone was enough for me to buy the Blu HD without thinking ($179) the day it hit. I immediately enrolled in the developer program with it (before using).8.1.1 shipped to Blu HD customers today, December 15, 2014.This is what I was using with the Blu.I certainly did not experience unusual behavior from the touch screen, as well as no issues using it while charging by the USB port.I did not use the supplied AC to USB adapter.As a matter of course I find all of them to be suboptimal in delivering the juice I desire.Amazon has high current and Intelligent multi port adapters that save me a ton of grief.For GPS do know that it is not satellite based.It gets its location by triangulating on cell tower locations.This could be an issue in some mountainous terrain.While my windows phone focus is primarily concerned with productive in the IT workplace, I like music too.Certainly, I had missed the free mix radio from the Lumia.And as of December 2014, there are several good music apps without buying the monthly service for the professional version of the mix radio.I was able to successfully use a 64GB UHC1 Micro SD, only needing about five GB inside the HD for the operating system and very few apps that insist on being carried on the internal RAM.The free applet Storage Sense makes short work of getting stuff on/off the internal RAM.Possibly because I was using software in advance of its General Release,my experiences with the Blu HD were 99.9% a delightful time (great battery time). Ifthe VOL button had not quit, I probably would not have gone further up the price scale to a Lumia 1520. It is so light you can forget you have it.If I ever find myself needing a smart phone in a suboptimal situation, Iwould not hesitate to get a short term SIM from Air Voice Wireless and the Blu HD.If you find yourself having to support a Windows environment and ever need to be "" Johnny on the spot"", you will not find a better mobile phone anywhere that does RDP (free beyond any airtime charges ) at any price point until you get to the Lumia 1520.From a purely RDP POV, that is a lot more money for one more inch of screen size.Another reviewer trashed the camera.Well, everything is relative.Certainly the camera on the Blu HD is not a Lumia 1520.And it beats the pants off of the flash less (sans flash LED) rear camera and zero front facing camera on the Lumia 635, and it's smaller lower resolution screen.HD owners can now use the Lumia camera, free.Finally a thought not mentioned elsewhere.The HD Blue windows phone is not 60 days old and they put out the latest and greatest software release.It was my money, I would certainly be comparing not to say, Verizon wireless.This would be the wireless carrier that sold customers Microsoft Windows phones (on contract) and will not bother to update the software.It appears the new windows phone entrant behaves quite responsibly.Yes, I am happy to answer specific questions that you pose.Other stuff like carry case is further down, older discoveries.HTH, Tcat Houserearlier commentary: mid-November 2014The worst part is finding the right specifications. Contrary to some reports, this specific entry Does have A-GPS.AndThe camera does auto focus.No GPS would be a deal killer..I like the fact they designed the extra stuff in like a silicon bump case and screen cover.I won't miss the the great Nokia Photo software as $10 at the MS phone store with replace camera360pro and proshot for example(many great finds -15 Dec)This DOES support a 64GB micro SD card.Software supported digital front/back zoom.. Auto focus.No NFC. No compass.Certainly not the build quality of Apple or Nokia, and certainlya fraction of the price.All that I'm missing is some sort belt holster.It ships with a sort of a case, and screen protector (1 installed, 1 spare).Moving from the Nokia was pretty invisible. MS handled the details of dumping my SD card, associated apps, yada-yada.Time to see if the Lumia apps that moved will function. ___ No! Ms deleted Nokia apps after sync. No matter the store has some great apps... the trick is keeping up with the changes.20 Nov 2014 update.$7. belt case [China-Eba-. com for a blu android studio 5] on the way. (I'm keeping it handy since @ current pricing, I will buy one for backup, I think).Sure the Nokia built in are great and independent work is more interesting and featured.On my home page I made a tile that groups tiles into a set of full sized of launchers of different camera 75 apps built to different specialty [burst mode, time lapse, editor, video, Yada-yada].Maybe too much for some and I suspect many reading here can apply the expanding folder idea. Yes multiple folders and lots of apps per folder.

Nice Dual SIM Windows Phone,"This is a great bargain phone.I have an ATT work sim and a cheap TMo personal sim (the $30 Walmart special) and I can use both with this phone.- I have had good luck with battery life, but I am not someone who is constantly fiddling with my phone.- the screen is IPS and looks good for a 720p screen.- the cheap processor hasn't been a problem, but i'm not running any heavy games.- it comes with a great set of accessories: case, headphones and screen protector.- its well made, and fit and finish is good (I've read some reviews that this might not always be the case)- Some people have complained about touch responsiveness, I have not had that problem.- it has SD expansion (see cons)Cons:- typical sub $200 phone camera.Outside with sunlight its fine, if you are doing low light you you results will suffer.- Snapdragon 200 is not the fastest processor.If you have tons of stuff running in the background you will notice.- stated limit for SD is 32 gb.I have read people are getting 64gb cards working but use at your own risk.I'm using a 32.- be careful when you set the phone up.You have the option of installing the same programs you have on any other phone you already have linked to you MS account.I have a Lumia 1520 and I said yes without thinking.The Win HD only has 8gb with lots already used by the OS and other system files.I had to manually move programs to the SD, change the settings to automatically store programs to SD and reboot to finish downloading and configuring.All in all I am very happy with my purchase, but make sure you understand the limitations of this device.Its not a Lumia 1520 or Icon replacement, but with the nice fit and finish and the possibilities the dual sim enables its a nice device.",2014年12月22日 在美国审核
Wonderful phone but the hardware is unreliable. Faulty battery? Lasted 2 days.,"My BLU Win HD Windows Phone bricked after two days of use, and two updates that were installed from the pre-existing out of the box 8.1 mobile OS (factory).For the price, this phone does so much and it overshadows any Nokia Lumia Windows phone I have used in the past.The sleek design, ease of use, and overall build quality can go toe-to-toe with the wide variety of flagship phones out there.I'm very picky about phones.I have used iPhones, Android phones, and my most recent phone was a Nokia Lumia 920.I was more satisfied using the BlU Win HD in the two days of use than I was with the Nokia Lumia.It is too bad that the phone bricked.Well, I think it was the battery because it would not power up.Long story short, I was texting a friend and all of a sudden the phone turned off by itself.I attempted hard reset and battery re-sitting methods, but no success.Also, I tried plugging the phone through USB and power outlet.Nothing.When I wasn't paranoid of whether this phone would continue to function properly, it was a great phone and it did everything I needed it to do and more.It's too bad that the hardware is unreliable. I am sending this defective phone back and I was told by Amazon that I will receive a refund (within 30-day refund/replacement window). I placed a new order for another BLU Win HD because I like this phone a lot, and it is the reason why I gave it 2 stars and not a 1 star.I think it is only fair.All in all, the BLU Win HD is a great phone despite its shortcomings in hardware and reliability.You'll never know when that day comes when this phone decides not to work and or function properly.",2015年8月23日 在美国审核
Homegrown windows phone,"Nice thin light weight device. Love the colorful bezel and back. The package contains a whole host of accessories, Plastic case (same color); battery, two (2) screen protectors (one pre-installed); headphones and wall charger. You don't nee to run down to the mall to get protection for your phone everything is there. I haven't had it long but have noticed a bit of a stutter when scrolling through the live tiles at times. I absolutely love Windows 8.1 (I actually have the 8.1 Update version through the Preview for Developers app).The rear camera is so so, the front camera is ok. but you will need to make sure there is a lot of light in the room for clearer shots.There are two SIM card slots and the only annoying thing for me is that you cannot remove the icon at the top of screen for whichever slot you're not using (either 1 or 2). I've also noticed that when I'm looking at my contacts, there is a setting for SIM 1 and SIM 2 to make your call on, with the default being SIM 1. Again, no big deal unless you're using slot #2.I cannot give you detailed information on the battery life yet but, can say it was a bit of a hassle when getting it connected to MetroPCS.MEtroPCS and T-Mobile are listed in the description so the assumption was that it would be an easy setup. I had to go to the store as the tech over the phone was unable to get me up and running. I still am unable to send receive MMS/picture messages.This may be a setting and not a limitation on the phone itself.So far I amthinking i got what I paid for. The phone does the job, I like win phone 8.1 a lot especially with cortana included. but set your expectations a little lower where the sound quality/level and screen brightness is concerned.All in all an OK device running a stellar OS.

So Disappointed,"I've had this phone for 9 months now. I was really excited to have a ""real"" smartphone finally. it had an impressive sounding processor and adequate memory for my needs. I have not been crushed by it's lack of performance but I have often been disappointed. I work with several much younger twenty-somethings and their phones seem to zoom through loading and playing videos with minimal delay or fatigue. This phone was supposed to be at least comparable but it is so disappointing. Surfing the internet is difficult and time consuming changing pages. Often I wait until I am home because I don't want to wait on my phone. i lovethe screen size. The picture quality is great. the camera seems limited. It doesn't have an easy or obvious screen icon to zoom in on a subject. Video quality is good enough for me.I'm not one that wants a million features on his phone but I want the ones I use to work well. The limits on the phone and the limits on the Windows OS app availability surprised me. Also, I've given up finding a case that fits it. Blu doesn't even have one! What company makes a semi-expensive product and doesn't care if you have any way to protect it. Very shotsighted... I bought a cover for the Studio HD because it had the same size screen. I thought maybe it would match. I had to cut out the slot for the power plugin. Theplaces for the power-on button and the volume controls don't match at all. It is a little embarrassing to have to rig up something juat to protect my phone. What were these knuckleheads thinking?!!! I am a quite disappointed in this Blu branded phone.

My Kids Love Them!  And I Love The Price!,"I just purchased this phone for my 14 year old son.I'm giving this phone 5 stars because for the price, it's a 5 star phone!My kids go through a lot of phones (my daughter just got the Blu 5.0 C after destroying her iPhone 5).I normally buy them used/refurbished phones, but I won't do that anymore now that we've discovered Blu. These phones are cheaper brand new than most used/refurbished phones in its class, and they work/look just as good.MY KIDS LOVE THEM!My kids use StraightTalk's AT&amp;T Service/SIM card.It was very easy to activate online.The phone is a nice size and feels good in your hand.It doesn't feel like a cheap phone by any means. The quality of the screen/picture is really good and reminds me a lot of my old Samsung.The camera could be better but this phones picture quality is definitely better than my daughters Blu 5.0 C phone (in case you're comparing, go with the 8.1).I'm an iPhone and Mac user so I'm not familiar with Windows but my son really likes it.While I was setting everything up for him I played around with it some and it was very easy to navigate.It responded well and there wasn't any lag.My son got the orange phone.In the pictures the color looked darker and we were expecting more of a burnt orange.This is not the case though...It is very bright orange!My son still loved it though.I will update this review periodically.I am interested to see how well these phones hold up over time.",2015年9月5日 在美国审核
A very good Windows phone for the price.,"This is my second smart phone; the first was the Lumia 521, which is Lumia's lowest cost Windows phone.Naturally, I expected this one to be better, especially as far as opening apps, and with a higher mega-pixel camera.I have to say, this is a great phone, especially considering it's unlocked, and under $150.The screen is a perfect size for me - bigger than the 521, which is great for browsing the web and running apps.Very responsive and fast as well; it easily opened apps in under half the time as the 521.Having a quad-core CPU and 1 GB of RAM rather than 512 MB no doubt is the main factor in that.The camera is pretty good, although I haven't taken any with the front facing camera, but the 8 MP takes decent pics.I've had this phone for about a week.Like others have said, it takes a little getting used to having the volume rocker on one side opposite the power button on the right side.But I've trained my fingers after a few days as to where to hold it so that I don't keep either turning down the volume or taking screen shots.The battery life is very good.The only somewhat disappointing thing is the vibrancy of the screen.The Lumia beats out this one, and it's most telling on the lock screen photo I have.But that's a pretty minor thing.Overall, if you're looking for a decent smart-phone that you can buy without having to be under contract with anyone (I use mine with T-Mobile), this is a great choice.",2015年5月6日 在美国审核
Great Low Cost Smartphone with Unusually Knowledgable Tech Support.,"As a Windows Phone developer I was initially somewhat reluctant to purchase such and inexpensive Windows 8.1 phone. But I felt that it was necessary to have one in our arsenal of Windows developer phone for testing compatibility. My first BLU HD Phone arrived DOA. But Amazon was quick to replace it. The second on quickly arrived and I activated it on T-Mobile since I have worked directly with them and know the tech support people. They inserted the SIM card and the phone was activated it about 3 minutes. I did have some question about development on a dual SIM phone. But a quick call to BLU in Miami, FL quickly got me in touch with amazingly knowledgeable technicians who were able to explain in great detail technical aspects of the phone. This technical support is available not only to developers but to anyone who purchases a BLU Win Phone.I think BLU is probably a very upcoming company with a great future in the Windows Phone market where we have seen so many companies leave for the free Android UI since it is running on a Linux shell which is in the public domain and Google gives the UI away free to phone manufactures. Resulting in the inferior Android domination of the Smartphone market even surpassing the IPhone sales numbers in the past year. If you want a really advanced and logical UI Smartphone, I highly recommend this company and its Win HD Phone.",2015年10月22日 在美国审核
it was an amazing phone,"the phone in general is good the color is a neon yellow, the hard part was to put the sims card since we didn't know what carrier was good for this phone this phone as two slots for sims card and a slot for memory if you go to the mall there aren't any cases out there for this phone just yet since this phone is the latest in the windows company, this phone works with AT&amp;T and / or T-Mobile (that is a maybe on T-Mobile) we did try Verizon but they said the phone wouldn't work with there system, when you put the narrator on this phone automatically locks this to a impossible to get the narrator off, you have to follow so basic steps since i googled and seems every windows phone has gone thru this once you put your password, you go to the search button type in ""Ease Access"" there you can turn off the narrator lol all this takes time since you have to hit twice each button. the phone in general on calls, texting, work amazing good the camera works just fine even tho makes my sis or me look a bit pale, if you download kik, Instagram, or anything else makes the phone runs slower not sure if its the actual app or the internet or the phone it self. the phone is big like a IPhone 6 plus so you can have an idea how big you get it. the screen savers that came with the phone was a bit bigger then the actual phone screen. the phone is a gift for my sis she loves it better then her IPhone 4.Do not drop the phone once you do the screen won't work this is an update she didn't drop it to test this it was an accident fell down 15 carpet stairs we went everywhere to fix it but the total cost will come out as the same as a brand new phone we have the phone the bottom part works the top part doesn't sad but she really adored that phone and i am usually the clumsy around the house be very careful once you drop it you might need to check everything since the liquid of the screen is the one that spilled over :(",2014年12月29日 在美国审核
Color:Orange,"I love it! i got it today, i had a bit of a problem trying to set it up but besides that i just love this phone.Im now updating this review. I still love this phone more than anything. it does have a lot less apps than that i was use to with an android but I really don't care because i found better apps than the ones i would use for photo collages and stuff. I can get google maps but I think its actually harder to navigate on a windows phone than an android. I love how much space is on this phone! I went to an Imagine Dragons concert, I had about 4 GB of memory left before the concert and I took about 150 pictures plus about 12-13 minutes of video all together and still had tons of space left. I'm super taken away by this only because my previous phone could hold 150 pictures and 4 apps (besides all the apps already on the phone). I can definitely say that this is the best phone I've ever had and I would tell you to get it because its the greatest upgrade I've had so far. Plus as far as I know it takes any kind of plan as long as you have your sim card because I have the Walmart family plan and like i said in the beginning it was kind of a pain in the butt setting up but if its not working just turn it off then back on and after about 5 minutes it should work perfectly fine.",2015年5月29日 在美国审核
Great phone much better than expected with the budget price it doesn't feel like a budget phone!,"This phone is well worth the price! Everything worked right out of the box with no hiccups, nice and smooth. Upon powering it up It updated all the apps once connected to wifi and also the latest windows update 8.1GDR1. The screen is nice and vivid with great colors, it does come with a pre-installed screen protector which is fine but I will be replacing with a Tempered glass screen protector, FYI the Mybat tempered screen protector for the HTC ONE M8 found here on Amazon is an almost perfect fit for this phone I already tested it. Calls are clear and I get 4G connection with AT&amp;T so it is plenty fast surfing the web and watching videos. I'd say if there were any negatives it would be the speaker placement, it is on the back of the phone near the bottom but in all honesty it sounds fine. I inserted a 32g micro SD card and it found it instantly and asked if I wanted all media and apps to be stored on the card.I haven't really tested the camera yet just a few shots in low light and they were fine.FOUND THE PHONE ON SALE AT MICROSOFT.COM AND AMAZON CAME THROUGH AND ISSUED A REFUND FOR THE DIFFERENCE $30!",2015年1月14日 在美国审核
I'm disappointed to say the least...,"Several things annoy me about this phone. The speaker is way too low. The media speaker is a little louder but still horrible compared to iPhone or HTC. It especially sucks with headphones in. My basic android phone had a better one...The screen seems to intermittently zoom in, the only way I've figured out how to fix this is to turn the phone off and then on again which is so agravating. I have issues with how sensitive the swiping mechanism works on this phone. You barely touch it and it goes to a completely different screen. What else?! Oh the app store sucks! Also with my old iphone, even when it died I could immediately plug in to charge and use my phone. With this one, if it dies, it takes at least 15 min worth of charge before it even powers back up. I think this phone is pretty wimpy. They talked it up like it was gonna be great but alas, it isn't.I'll be upgrading to another Iphone for Christmas and giving this one to my 10 yr old to use with the wifi at home for games and videos. seems like it might be a better phone for kids or a teenager maybe?",2015年10月26日 在美国审核

4.5/5  Windows OS is excellent; Nice phone,"Software Pros:- Windows Phone 8.1 OS is excellent; I've used/owned them all, and WP8.1 is simple, rich feeling, fun, and has a ton of character. It's hard to pull off all four in my opinion, but WP8.1 manages to. I prefer it to Silk, Android, and IOS (which are all pretty nice too).- Live tiles are a nice interesting feature to me; very modern and current feeling.- Cortana actually worksSoftware Cons:- The Microsoft App store is slowly growing. I like that they've eliminated most of the redundant garbage apps (as found in spades in other app stores), but still have the main stays like Kickstarter, OneDrive, Flipboard, Netflix, Facebook, Twitter, Sub Surfers, Temple Run, Instagram, Spotify, Pandora, ect. With that said, the store could still use more apps. Amazon Cloud Music for example.- Original Camera app sucks- Initially, the touchy main screen. (Mentioned below, seems to be fine with update)Hardware Pros:- High quality build, great feeling in hand- lightweight- nice screen- great battery- excellent viewing angles- very bright- phone, speaker, and camera all decent for the $149 price tag- Good looking phone.Hardware Cons:-I don't like the placement of external power button. With the case on, too many accidental screen shot for my tastes. Maybe move power button to top?- Charger gets warm- Navigation buttons should be illuminated, but aren't- I liked the ability to double tap the screen to wake my last Windows phone, not an option hereSome notes:- It's not perfect, although close, and could be made perfect (for this price point) by BLU very easily with a couple small updates.- A free photo app from the app store (Camera360) helps the camera immensely. Better pictures, more color, and the ability to zoom.- Preview for Developers (a free Microsoft app) sorted out the sometimes hyper-active screen touches for me. Maybe a software issue; feels better now.- Screen protector came installed and without any bubbles. Thankfully, as I hate bubbles.- Body has no noticeable flex- Phone works while charging, although typing/scrolling isn't as fluid for some reason- Extra accessories tossed in box are a nice bonus.(Case, 2 screen protectors, ear buds, USB/wall charger)- Processor feels plenty fast, although I'm not a gamer- BLU should be selling accessories for this phone on their website like every other manufacturer does. Or at least on Amazon.- I'd recommend this phone to family/friendsQuestions? Ask away!",2014年11月30日 在美国审核
Very decent phone,"First off, I got the orange phone. Very vibrant color! I wish I would have gone with green, but at least it is unique in its own way.Okay, the screen is huge. Love that. But its super sensitive, and I can't figure out how to calibrate it. It works great, perfect for what I needed. I love how you can personalize your start screen. Super fast internet, network or wifi. Good battery life.A few flaws: The camera isn't THAT great, but still useable.I would definitely use the charger it comes with. I used a different brand charger, and the keyboard would not work properly when I tried to text while charging.It comes with a charger, one screen protector, a cute gel like case,and earphones. The earphones are oddly shaped, but still work great.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase!",2015年10月19日 在美国审核
Cannot beat this Blu Win HD for all that you get at such a kick-ass price!,"I purchased and received my Blu Win HD in May of this year.Historically, I am hard on phones - and while I am working on that it remains so. Also, while visiting my daughter in Kansas, my granddaughter would borrow it for a couple of hours to watch umpteen videos. She would leave, I dunno, prolly 25-30 videos on there that I would have to exit from. Blue never missed a beat. I drop it, sit on it (trust me, I am not a small girl) laid it on something wet and it has not let me down. What's amazing is what you're getting for the price you're paying...it almost seems like committing highway robbery the price is so reasonable. Only two things that I would consider the least bit negative: the back cover is way too flimsy, about as thick as a cheap plastic plate. I am pretty sure my debit card is thicker.Secondly, I believe I have heard this before: the volume and on/off switches are at the exact same place on either side of the phone. Unbeknownst to me before owning this phone, if you push them at the same time, wallah! You have a screen shot.Yesterday, I deleted 62 screen shots from my pics.Today is my beautiful granddaughters 6th birthday. Would anyone like to guess what she got from her Mamee (das me)? A Blu Windows Jr. - not for texts or calls but for those blamin' videos! She was completely overjoyed.So, yeah, I would suggest this wonderful phone to anyone, anytime. Way to go Blu!!",2015年9月30日 在美国审核
From Android to Windows.,"This is my first Windows Phone.Prior to this I had a Samsung S5 Gold, I switch because my S5 I had from Rent A Center and wanted to save some money by eliminating that payment and figured I would give Windows Phones a try since I missed the Amazon Fire being on sale for $199 and the Windows 10 update will be free for the first year for all 7, 8, and 8.1 devices. I am very impressed with this phone for the price. Cortana is very useful.Its a very organized phone not much room for customization but makes up for it in the fact that you have no reason to customize it because its extremely quick and efficient.One downside is if you're not using 2 sim cards the symbol for missing sim card stays at the top also make sure which sim card slot you're using (yes the slots are labeled) is on the home screen so when you try to make a call you're not trying to figure out why nothing is there (the app for each sim slot is labeled 1 and 2).Camera is great.Screen resolution is only 720 however IMO their is little to no difference unless you're actually trying to notice the difference. Comes with a screen protector preinstalled and a backup for when you need it.I do wish it came in black as all of my TVs are black my custom built PC is black my external hard drive is black, if you can't tell I like black and things that match.Another complaint about the phone is the lack of cases the only cases around are the wallet cases which I don't only cash, debit cards, and phone all in one spot especially since I have a Elder Scrolls Online wallet that I like.It does come with a silicone case that easily slides on which will work.App store is not nearly as stocked as Apples App Store or the Google Play store.However I don't use the many apps mainly just the CNN, Amazon, Facebook, and several games (which before I had games on my Android but never played them but with this phone I'm actually playing the games I download). One last feature I love over Android is the easily available updates no longer having updates come out for one device and waiting for them to come out for mine.Overall great phone not going back to Android any time soon, prefer the organization and look of my Windows Phone.",2015年2月11日 在美国审核

I love these phones as they not only look nice,"This is my 3rd Blu product purchase.I love these phones as they not only look nice, operate well but they have dual sim card slots which is a definite must for me.The price is also great for any of their phones.I purchased this new Win 5 HD so I can be ready to upgrade when Windows 10 comes on the market as I use Windows platform for all my devices.So far, I really like the phone and seems to work pretty good as I've only had it a few days.I am hoping the power/usb plug on the phone doesn't go bad like it did on my other two Android Blu Life Play and Play X.That was disappointing to me.Plus the battery life on them was not very good.Will probably come back later to give usage updates and status.But so far, so good.",2015年5月27日 在美国审核
Definitely worth it,"I purchased this phone and had it for about two weeks after I discovered the Blu Vivo Air. Anyway, I was surprisingly satisfied with this phone. I was never aware of Blu, so I was a bit skeptical of their phone quality and their prices. So I looked up some unboxing videos on YouTube, and by reading the screen cover on the phone, the unboxing geeks said that the phone would have slow performance because of the ""dragon software"" and other terminology I couldn't understand, and that the phone would not be capable of performing at 4G network speed. They also mentioned that it wasn't ""true"" 1080 hd because one of the description labels on the screen cover gave it away. I ignored these things and bought the phone and boy, was I in for a treat. The graphics didn't look too good in the videos, but the graphics are awesome. In my opinion, this phone displays true 1080 hd. The phone's performance is splendid. It has a front camera (with sucky quality but hey, I have a front camera). The main camera produces clear images. The phone is lightweight but sturdy, I dropped it a few times while it was unprotected and had no dents or scratches. It also comes with screen protectors and headphones and this phone looks great. For those of you that are a fan of Windows, this phone is definitely worth it.",2015年4月15日 在美国审核
Awesome phone,"I cant say enough about this phone. I love the fact that not only are you paying for a phone, but a screen cover already put on, ear buds with radio antenna, and phone case cover. I have had a hard time finding an extra cover for the phone but so far the one that came with the phone is holding up very well. The screen is nice and big. Cortona is much better that Siri. Cortona figures out all the things and places you like as well as remind you of things you need to do. Unfortunately not all apps are open to this phone since it is a windows, but there is a very good selection of apps that are available. Sometimes the screen can be a little touchy but after you start using it, the phone adjusts. The one thing that I had to get used to was the moving tiles. You don't have one main screen but rather a background that the tiles show. Getting my phone set up for AT&amp;T was pretty easy. I just went to the local store near me and they had me all set up.",2015年8月9日 在美国审核
Two Stars,My first smart phone! Very impressive!This is an update: The Blu phone is a good product but the windows software is AWFUL! It took me 2 months to get group text to finally work on win 8.1. It was upgraded to win 10 and never got to get group text to work again. Windows has no support at all! Win10 was to handle android apps. Forget it. I would download an app. When I installed it Windows would tell me I need an app for that. Never tells you what app you need just says you need an app! A waste of time. I will never buy a windows phone ever again!!!!!Now the Blu phone itself is worth the price. Colors a good. Never had a problem making calls. If you buy one get the android one.,2015年9月18日 在美国审核
GREAT windows phone,"This is quite an attractive phone.It is fairly fast though it does slow down on some games.I purchased this as an extra phone that I could have a personal number not just a work cell, and keep all of my private stuff private.I love the design, having the camera and speaker OFF the glass part of the screen is ingenious because it makes the screen protectors only have to be a plain rectangle with no holes to line up.The orange is bright and ""happy"", with a matching semi-transparent orange case that comes with it.I also wanted a dual SIM so that when I take trips to Europe I can have a separate SIM and number to use over there.In the US I use the T-Mobile package that has unlimited data and texts with only 100 minutes talk time because I talk on the other phone and this $30/ month plan gives me all the data I want on this phone.",2015年2月26日 在美国审核
"Pretty good low cost unlocked phone, with Dual SIM!","After about a week of using the phone, I would say it is a good replacement phone. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles you will get with a Nokia Lumia (of which I have the 920 model as my comparison), but it works well. The BLU Win HD is a Dual SIM phone, which is great. The model I have has the 1700 frequency which with my T-Mobile SIM I was hoping would get me decent data speeds, but haven't seen that yet, in my locations its been on the low end of 3G speeds, 1-3 Mbps, I was hoping for closer to 7 when I was on HSPA+, but haven't seen that yet. But I'm not too concerned as I don't need super data speeds when I'm not on WiFi, since I use data mainly for emails and occasional web browsing.Once thing that I've noticed is that the touch screen sensitivity can be iffy at times. Sometimes when you are scrolling it is super sensitive and will result in a touch selection instead of a swipe for scrolling. Other times its as if it didn't recognize you touched the screen. But I need to use it a bit more to see if this is just a matter of adjusting to the device coming from the Nokia Lumia 920.Not having the 3 buttons at the bottom backlit (back, windows, search) like they are on the Lumia is a drawback, since it is hard to see the buttons when you are not in a bright lit room. But I guess you eventually get used to where the buttons are and don't need to see them. Not having a Camera button is something to get used to.The position of the volume rocker on the left and the power button on the right can be tricky at times. Both buttons seem very sensitive. But because of their position on the top sides of the phone, when I'm holding the phone I've been unintentionally taking screenshots (power + volume up) because of the sensitivity of the buttons.The camera doesn't seem to have any zoom, and the auto-focus seems slow at times. Photo quality is average. You won't have the ability to install any of the Lumia specific camera apps, so keep that in mind.Having a microSD slot is a big plus since the internal storage is only 8GB.So as a backup phone, or a cheap replacement when something bad happens to your high end phone, I think this works. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on an unlocked phone and still have a quality phone I would recommend the BLUE Win HD.UPDATE 12-18-2014BLU pushed out an update a couple days ago that seems to have improved the sensitivity of the touch screen, so now it is a bit better for me. The camera also seems to be working better, they've added zoom capability, and the autofocus seems improved as well. I've been using this phone now for a few days as my main phone, and I can say the battery life is great. Keep up the good work BLU!UPDATE 2-18-2015This phone has now replaced my previous Nokia Lumia 920 as my main phone. After starting to use it as my main phone back in December, I haven't gone back. The battery life on the Nokia became horrible with the WP 8.1 update, requiring me to charge the phone after half a day of no usage. I even purchased a brand new replacement battery for the Lumia, and the result was the same, there must be some hardware flaw in the Lumia or one of the Lumia specific applications drains the battery, and battery saver doesn't show it. The only thing I miss from the Lumia is the anti-glare screen, using the BLU Win HD in sunlight is a huge challenge. But other than that, it has been great and every update they push seems to resolve any minor issues that might have been present. They pushed an update a couple weeks ago, for which I didn't notice anything different with, its been working great for me. I would love to see BLU create a high-end Windows phone similar to their higher end Android models.",2014年12月9日 在美国审核
Great Phone for the Value,"I absolutely love this phone. I hate to admit that, as I abhor how people are always on their phones, but, to be honest, I can see why they are. I have, so far, up to 4 e-mails linked up to my phone, which is nice to be able to have available when I need it. The phone volume isn't very loud, but I have a set of Bose ear buds that I have been using for strictly for my MP3 player. Well, the Bose ear buds work amazing with the phone! The answer/end button also plays and pauses MP3's on the memory card. I'm still discovering everything I can do on this phone, and expect to find much more later on. I do also love the fact that it has two sim card slots, because if I do plan to go over seas to travel, I can still pop in a prepaid sim card and use my phone with out removing my original. Overall, I am very happy with this phone, and can see why people never put down their phones. The only challenge I have now, is trying to not become one of those people.",2015年2月19日 在美国审核
"Great for the Price, Does just about everything I need it to. Battery replacement needed after +1 year, though.","I really like this phone.Considering that I'm coming off of using a more basic/no-touchscreen phone this feels like a huge upgrade.The interface took a while to figure out but it's pretty simple once you get used to it.Pros: I love the color of the phone, the Windows app store has pretty much anything I'd want, the camera works beautifully for me, video looks great from youtube and games, with a flashlight app the LED is bright enough. Cortana, though still in beta, is very helpful. I'm hoping that with further development the voice recognition and additional voice commands will improve it's performance, but still very cool.Annoyances: Volume button is on top left and unlock/lock button is on top right. Pressing both at the same time takes a screen shot. Because of how I hold my phone to press either of those buttons I wind up pressing the other and so, inadvertently, have taken many accidental screen shots. Not a huge deal since it's easy enough to delete the picture, but there should be a way to turn off this ""feature"".Cons: The only issue that's been really nagging me is the headset microphone. Many people on the other end have a hard time hearing me, though the mic on the phone seems to work just fine. I feel like I'm shouting anytime I use the headset.I haven't tried using a different one to test it out though to see if it's a phone issue or just the headset itself.One other con I have though you would think of as a pro is the two sims.I have an old sim card (mini sim) that I wanted to use. There is a slot for this in the phone's ""Sim 2 port"" which I thought would be no problem.The default Sim, however, is the ""Sim 1 port"" which takes a micro sim.I didn't want to bother with getting a new Sim or risk destroying my Sim by cutting it, or spend the $5 for a cutting tool I'd only use once, so I just left that slot 1 empty.Well, if I want to dial a number that I see in Internet Explorer, or that Cortana brings up in searches it will only try to make that call using the Sim 1 port.Since I don't have anything in there it tells me that it is unable to make the call.There's got to be a way to change your default Sim to port 2, but I haven't seen it.So I have to copy/paste or memorize the phone number and dial it manually. This seems more a software issue so I hope in Windows Phone 10 it will be fixed.EDIT after +1 year of ownership:I've owned the phone over a year now and have really enjoyed it. I bought a JVC headset that works perfectly so I don't have to yell into the OEM headset.I've also learned to live with the dual SIM card issue. I am running into problems, though, with the battery now.It hasn't been holding a charge very well lately. I popped the back off to see and the battery has swollen, so much so that the back of the phone can't close completely anymore.I sent a message to Blu services and waiting on a response.I can't find an OEM battery so am considering purchasing an aftermarket battery here on Amazon by Cameron Sino.Really love the phone, would hate to lose it.",2015年7月6日 在美国审核
The Perfect Pink Phone Tons of Features...,"Did some research on this phone and was not disappointed when it arrived. Very high quality, fast, and colorful phone.

What was impressive was the call quality and the sound from the built in speaker, super clear sound.

GO BLU,"I was never interested in getting a windows phone, but the Blu Win hd 5-inch Windows phone was a great introduction. The phone is very responsive I enjoy the fact you can put all you more frequently used apps on one screen. I haven't had any problems with dropped calls or my bluetooth not connecting. The camera is good for close up it doesn't take good distant pictures.The screen has 3 levels of brightness on high it will light up my bedroom but on low its hard to see outside. The size and weight of this phone is unbelievable, I'm very hard on a phone I've dropped this phone from as high as a second story balcony to as low as my back pocket and no damage to the phone or screen. I had a Samsung Galaxy 3 second day I had it slipped out of my hand screen shattered.

Great phone at a great price!,"This is an almost perfect Windows 8.1 phone and is far better than some reviewers have said it was. I've had mine a little more than a month. Sure, it has one or two minor flaws but that is in the operation system and not the equipment itself. Nothing is perfect, after all. That said, and after having Android phones for the past 5 or 6 years, it's certainly very nice to finally have a very good Windows phone that works like it should.BLU has released a great phone with the Win HD (W510u) and at a very attractive price. While I'm not much of a fan of Windows 8.1 on a desktop/laptop computers, I think it works very well on this touch screen cell phone. The only drawbacks are the slightly different workings the OS has on this small platform vs a larger one such as with a standard desktop &amp; monitor. (Touch screen monitors for desktops are still a little pricey for the average user.) But those drawbacks are small and will not be a problem at all after a month or so more of use. Battery life for me is very good but then, I don't use a phone as a constant entertainment device. i do have a couple of minor games on it for time killers while waiting for a doctor appointment, etc. Other than phone use, it will otherwise be used more for reading than games, whether it be the latest news or a book, again when needing to kill time. Cortana also works very well and is very good at speech recognition. I like the fact that the voice programmers added a bit of humor to make her likable.As long as BLU, or others, make such Windows phones with the quality as good as this one, I'll never go back to Android which I always found lacking in some ways. I never did like all the scrolling needed in Android with so much useless crap coming preloaded on the phone. If you want a Windows phone, this BLU Win HD is a great starting place at a great price!",2015年1月10日 在美国审核
Surprisingly Windows 8.1 Phone...And it is 4G!!!,"Ordered the phones as Christmas gifts for my children and on for myself. These are primary phones for the kids and work phone for me. The phone is surprisingly fast, not as fast as my Nokia 1520, but for an entry level Windows phone, it is made well. The specs are far better than any of the other budget windows phone to date, and with the update from BLU and Microsoft, the phone is more responsive. Many reviews have complained that the phone is only 3g, which in reality it is indeed 4G as stated by BLU. We are on MetroPCS service and intially when the phones were activated, the phones only recieved 3G and HSPA+ service. Made a phone call to customer service at MetroPCS and had them reset the phone service to 4G. Made sure that MetroPCS had the phones set as HTC windows phones and viola!!! 4G service!!!If you see in other reviews of people complaining about only 3G service and that calling BLU to compain or returning for refund because of such, please ignore and follow my above suggestion. It has the 4G channels for T-Mobile, MetroPCS, Cricket, AT&amp;T, and other USA cellular providers.Please use SIM1 slot as your primary SIM in order to use the primary functions of the phone.As far as features, the main camera takes good pictures after the update. Video chatting works very well. Playing games also works well, again, ignore other reviewers about the type of processor. It is a bit dated, but it does get the job done for an entry level phone. The kids can now be more productive in school with MS Office on the phone. Now the household, with the exception of the wife, are all Windows Phones and loving it.The phones look top notch and the screen is beautiful. Some people complained about HD video playback, and from what have tested from Youtube, Netflix, and personal videos, all played well at 720p. Again, this not a 1080p screen. Video recording at 720p was flawless once I installedhigh speed microSD cards. I tested 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB and had no issues with storing and recording.It comes with the screen protector already applied from BLU. I love that it comes with an extra screen protector, headphones, case and of course charger. Call quality is good and music sounds nice when using better quality headphones/ear buds. If I had any gripes, it would be that the screen is very sensitive at times and when using the power button, you wind up taking screen shots by accident because it is opposite of the volume buttons.Overall, the phone is, IMO, the best in it's price range with the looks and features of more expensive phones.**Update**After the update, video recording is at a maximum of 864x480. Nonetheless...video is pretty good for an entry level phone. I wish people would stop complaining for what the phone isn't and see it for what it is designed for. You a great deal more as apposed to other budget phones...5"" HD(720p) screen, a camera with flash, and a front facing camera!!! There are hardly any other budget phone with these features included and at this price point.I'm just saying...if you want a phone with high end features, then you have to spend high end money.",2014年12月28日 在美国审核
The first thing I noticed was the beautiful HD display,"Pleasantly surprised. A note to MetroPCS customers, if you are upgrading from an old phone take a look at the SIM card. If it begins with ""890"" you should be okay, if it doesn't, you'll have to buy a new one for about $10 at your local store.Now onto the phone! The first thing I noticed was the beautiful HD display, it is awesome! I was trying to find myself a used Nokia Lumia 920 but so many people don't know what ""unlocked GSM"" means and they are unwilling to call their provider and unlock the phone for you. These bad boys are unlocked by design.Snapdragon 200 processor isn't as powerful as the 400 but the phone is just as snippy as anything I've used.At first, I was concerned about build quality because the back plate isn't solid, it's definitely flimsy but once it was in place I was reassured and after my fiasco with the SIM card I had to take it off and put it back on many times. It stood up to at least 10 times of me snapping it in and peeling it back off. It's still good, no signs of any damage anywhere.The real reason to get this phone is that it comes with Windows 8.1 which is a polished OS. Like most people I've used iOS and Android before. The only reason you would not want this phone is if you are a diehard Google fan. There are no Google apps, Gmail is about the only thing supported but there are no tabs which makes it frustrating when filtering through what matters. Drive only has one third party app that only let's you look at what's on your drive and download it. No adding or editing right then and there.The reason I'm okay with this is that I already have a PC and a Tablet both running Windows 8.1 so having the same login, email, exchange account, etc between all devices make for a more fluid experience. If you're unsure about the Windows apps and such I wouldn't worry, I knew that I wanted to give it a try and so far everything I wanted has been there in some form or another. Except for, of course, the dedicated Google apps.For the money, this phone gives you a quad core proc, 1gb of ram, Windows 8.1, and an HD screen.",2014年12月11日 在美国审核

Excellent phone,"This is an excellent phone. I have been using Android smartphone since the launch of the T-Mobile G1. As of late, I had been looking into switching to the Windows Phone ecosystem. I purchased the Blu Win HD a few months ago and thus far, this phone has been extremely reliable. Overall, the build quality is good and the OS is very responsive. Furthermore, Windows Phone 8.1 is a very user-friendly OS that is on par with iOS and Android.One thing to consider is the application ecosystem and the third-party applications you use on a day to day basis. While being an excellent platform, the Windows Phone ecosystem is relatively spartan compared to the plethora of third-party apps that are available on Android and iOS. In my case, I use my phone mainly for e-mail and light web browsing while travelling, so this phone (and the Windows Phone OS) works well for my needs.",2015年4月5日 在美国审核

Great Phone Do Not Buy If You Are A Heavy Phone Gamer,"Hello everyone, I just purchased the Blu Win HD about a week ago and I must say it does everything smoothly and you do get a lot of bang for your buck.Pros:Screen is very nice for watching videos, looking at pictures, tweeting, doing the basics.It is extremely light.1 gig of ram to ""play games"" (I'll get back to that in a second)Very bright phone, you wont lose it.front facing camera and flash (you dont get that in a lot of nokias in the same price range)Unlocked and Cheap Dual SimExpandable storageCons:Snapdragon Processor is the only gripe and let me explain as to why that is and I will try to put in simple terms. Seeing as this is a 720P display, you would think that they would put in a bigger processor to power all the pixels that are in the screen. However they decided to put the lowest end quad core processor to keep costs low. The point I am trying to get at is that this phone has problems playing big graphics demanding games.Conclusion: If you are looking for a cheap light unlocked phone that you will do the basics with and light gaming and watch videos and tweet facebook take pictures with and stuff like that then this phone will be amazing for you. It will be a great worthy investment. However if you are planning on using this for the most demanding of applications in the windows store like graphic intensive games then this wouldn't be the phone for you. I personally dont play games on my phone so it doesn't bother me, but in case someone is planning on buying this just keep that in mind that this wont run the heaviest games.

I'll update after my next set of travels to comment on the secondary SIM use.2 tiny nit pick items:1- I wish the charge port was at the bottom of the phone.Most in car charging bases and in home appliances assume this so it is a bit of a pain to pull the cord up and around and makes moving the phone annoying.2- Unlike many of the Nokia phones, this one does not have QI technology to allow for wireless charging.I'd buy another new version of this phone in an instant if this were added although I suspect it would make the phone a bit thicker and heavier.",2014年12月9日 在美国审核

Blu Win HD Windows Phone review,"Review for Blu Win HD Windows Phone:To begin with I've now had this phone since early February and I use it daily. I use it through StraightTalk.What I love about this phone primarily would have to do with its more than sufficient battery life. I can easily go two whole days without a charge with normal talk/text time and minimal data usage. Windows 8.1 is also a wonderful layout and makes for a great mobile experience for practically anyone.While the above deals with primarily what I love about my phone, there are a few annoyances that anyone should consider before purchasing this phone. If you're looking for a great camera phone (both front and rear-facing), then continue to look past this one. While the camera isn't trash it certainly isn't terrific. The overall exterior durability of the phone is somewhat questionable; something to think about.To conclude, this is a decent phone and I'm pleased with my purchase thus far. If you're looking for an affordable phone that operates Windows, seriously consider the Blu Win HD Windows Phone.",2015年4月17日 在美国审核

"First the good, which there is a lot of","The price has a lot to do with the rating. First the good, which there is a lot of. The phone is nice looking, with s solid feel. It feels much more expensive. I am comparing this with the much more expensive LG G2 and the less expensive Nokia 521. Overall it is more like the LG. I love the thin shape. The screen is clear. The phone is responsive and fast. Call qualityis good. Music sounds good through the headphones. The camera is easily passable, although not great. The flash and front facing cameras make this better than the Nokia.The bad. I almost returned it right after I turned it on. Initially the screen was very unresponsive. It took a fairly hard press to respond, meaning the app you touched would open, even if you were trying to swipe. After about 10 minutes of playing around, this got better. It still occasionally acts up, requiring a reboot. The screen also falls out of sync occasionally , maybe once every few days. I see this playing words with friends, there the letters are in the right place, but the grid background is shifted to only the lower left corner. Restarting the game usually fixes it. These problems seem to be getting better, and hopefullywill disappear in time. I know this sounds like a software problem, but it did not happen on the Nokia.Lastly the reception is poor compared to the LG, showing one or two bars less, and similar to the Nokia.Overall I would say its a good phone. If it were a $400 phone, it would get 2 stars. As it is, the price is good, and the phone is better than I expected in this range. The included screen protector and rubber case are a great addition, as I could not find any aftermarket cases.",2014年10月4日 在美国审核

Amazon 5 phone 3,"Amazon did a great job delivering this item 5 stars to them but this item fell short on my Expectation. Once this item was in my hands I thought this phone was awesome. The style was nice, it had most of the features that windows has that I loved, and the display was great, but there were some things that bugged me. First was the way they displayed the duel sim cards. It was sim1 and sim2. You could changed the name to anything you wanted but the ""1"" and ""2"" was always displayed in massaging and phone, so it always looked like you had 1 or 2 messages or missed calls. When you send a text or video the quality of the picture degrades and for an 8 second video is so grainy it's hard to tell what's in the video. Another problem if you are getting this for the free GPS you will be a little disappointed. After the system update you only have 4gbs of internal storage left and guess what it takes 4 gbs to download the USA offline maps for this phone. For some reason you can not put this info on the SD card. If you are going to use the GPS you will have use your data plan or download only the states you will drive through on your trip. The main reason I had to return this phone was the sensitivity on the screen. If you touched the screen it would choose everything instead of letting you scroll up or down. There was no sensitivity settings either. I got online to research this issue and the website told me to download an update but it got worse. I reset it and still the same problem.

Beautiful looking paper weight.,"I was very excited about this phone.. came fast with 2-day shipping and from the good reviews, it looked like a solid purchase. Packaging is nice, looks great, seems well-built, however, it doesn't function at all. Took about 5-10 mins to start up while on a charger, then it decided to start restarting itself a bunch of times. I was able to get it to stay on once for a few mins in which I connected to my wifi and updated the firmware, thinking maybe that would help. To my dismay, however, it just continued to restart even after inserting the sim card. Such a bummer. Like I said, it looks great and feels nice in the hand; but, it won't even boot-up and it's not a Windows issue from 8.1 I believe (since I did update the firmware). I'll be sending back and probably going back to Nokia branded since my old Lumia has had virtually no problems from the day I got it.

I have a 32GB SD in mine loaded with all my apps and music and it's awesome to be able to pop in another SIM when roaming.- Connectivity is good (not great). HSPA+ isn't LTE but works fine; Bluetooth and Wifi have both worked just fine for me (I listen to podcasts on the way to work over bluetooth every day).- Battery is removable (if you still care) and battery life is surprisingly great (I never have to charge during the day at work like I used to).- Seems durable enough - I've dropped it a couple times (no case, though one is included) and beyond a scratch or two on the plastic, it looks just fine.If you're on a budget, between upgrades on contract, or coming from a featurephone, it's a no brainer. Just click buy.That said, it's cheap for reasons. Here's what I noticed coming from a Lumia Icon and an iPhone 5 before that:- Speakers are terrible. The included ringtones have major clipping and anything over about 50% volume is a distorted mess. Then again, it's a $170 phone.- Screen sensitivity is an issue. It was unusable until I took the (preinstalled) screen protector off; once I did that it's mostly fine, but occasionally skips or interprets a swipe as a tap (like the 1520). This often results in me accidentally opening emails, clicking links, or expanding tweets. Annoying, but then again, it's a $170 phone.- Vibration motor is pretty weak. I often miss notifications.- SD card seems prone to becoming unseated. When this happens, the OS freaks out until I remove the battery and do a fresh boot with the SD card reinstalled.- Build quality is pretty cheap (case flexes and creaks, screen isn't gorilla glass and has no oleophobic coating); then again, the phone is pretty cheap.- No NFC (not really a big deal)- Camera has a flash but it only works as a (terrible) flash; no flashlight mode.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone who is looking for a basic smartphone but doesn't want to spend to much, or is in between upgrades or (like me) waiting for the next real Windows Phone flagship to come along. It also works great on T-Mobile for Windows Phone fans there who wish they had more options. However, if you're on a current-gen smartphone like the iPhone 6, Lumia Icon/1520, or a modern Android device, this will probably feel like a step down. Which it should, because it's less than a third the price.",2014年11月5日 在美国审核

I like the Windows Phone and I would like BLU too ...,"I like the Windows Phone and I would like BLU too if the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi setup would allow independent use of data as I CHOOSE either on cellular or Wi-Fi . Since there was no way to chose which provider I want to use for data connections i.e. mobile or Wi-Fi it was a deal breaker for me, and I returned after about 2 weeks testing. Adding insult to injury BLU uses inferior radios for Bluetooth mobile and Wi-Fi connections. And that is both OS Android and Windows. I know since I still have BLU Life and Pebble kikstarter editionthe Bluetooth connection lost in just stepping out of my small office, if I left the phone on the desk, and wouldn't reconnect upon return to the room.

"Horrible camera, over-sensitive touchscreen","This phone leaves much to be desired.I was a long time user of the Nokia Lumia 520, but had to upgrade since it is essentially discontinued and I smashed the screen of mine.Cons of the BLU Win HD-The phone's camera is terrible.I figured, 8MP, should be great.But the photos are grainy and the camera struggles to focus.Any zooming makes the photos look horrible.I used to print 4x6 photos of pics taken with my Lumia, but there is no way I will be able to print these pictures and have them look decent.Many of the videos I have taken have been out of focus.Also, all the pictures I have taken have been at the wrong orientation and have required editing to right them.I have checked the camera settings to make sure they are set to the best, and they are.It is just a poor camera.-The speaker is less than ideal.When using speaker phone at the highest volume setting (10/10), you can barely hear the other person on the other line unless in a completely sound-sterile environment.Also, the speaker skips and jumps around when playing music that is treble-heavy.It's almost like it's struggling to keep up with the speed of the music.I listen to mediation music that has a lot of chimes in it and this phone cannot play it.I had to break out an old phone and play the meditation music through it, instead.-Touch screen sensitivity is way too sensitive!It is nearly impossible to scroll on a webpage without inadvertently clicking on another link, or picture, and being redirected.I checked some online blogs and I see that many people have the same issue.There is no way to adjust the screen sensitivity, so you are stuck with it.This over sensitive screen also creates problems when you are speaking on the phone.Just by it brushing up against your cheek, it will toggle between calls when you don't want it to, and mute the phone when you don't want it to.This is by far the most annoying feature of the phone.On the positive side, the large screen is nice and the color selections are nice, too.But, those couple positives are not enough to overcome the negatives.I would not recommend this phone and I although I just got it 3 weeks ago, I am considering purchasing a different phone.It is so user-unfriendly that I don't want to put up with the hassle.",2015年5月17日 在美国审核
At first this phone was great! I purchased it about a year ago and ...,"At first this phone was great! I purchased it about a year ago and at the time you couldn't beat the price. I had never had a windows phone before and I actually like the organization that it gave you but after a year I've been looking for a replacement. My biggest thing is that while I'm on the phone talking to someone it puts that person on hold and calls them again, I don't even understand how it manages to do that. Another thing is the camera quality is garbage. When pulling up the internet a lot of the time it says it's done loading and it's just a black white screen and you have to keep reloading and reloading it until it pulls up right. At this point the touch part is messing up, I'll click on something and it will click on something on the other side of the screen and ill have to lock it and unlock it for it to start working right again. Another thing is that I just miss android apps... my brother and boyfriend will find all these cool apps on their androids and I can't get any of them on my windows phone. There are like no good apps at all :( but it works pretty decently, especially at first you would just hope that a good quality phone would last longer that a year before its starts messing up.

I'd say it would need to be boosted by at least 30% in order to match other phones. This is regardless of which music app, which pair of headphones and which device I'm plugging it in through an aux cable with. I keep my old Lumia 521 in my car for music.3) Touchscreen goes extremely crazy when sending text messages - for every button I press 4-8 more are pressed.

"If you pay big bucks for a phone just for casual use, you are a sucker!","This is my wife's phone.She is not very tech savy.The first smartphone she owned was the one before this Blu Win HD, it was a Nokia 925.It was twice the price of this phone, even though it was on sale.So for that amount of money, you expect something good.Well, the Nokia broke down after a couple of months, she got the whole earphone jack issue that was known for this model but for which I did not see any reviews on, UNTIL after it happened to us.I was really mad that I got sold a known flawed model.Then it broke down even further to the point I started looking for another phone for her.I read all kinds of good reviews for Blu Win HD on Amazon and WPCentral.And so I bought this Blu Win HD.I know the Blu Win JR would have been ok, but we wanted a 5 inch screen and the slightly better specs (I work for a living, so I will splurge)We've only had this for a couple of days, so I will be updating as time goes by.Other reviews will talk about what's included in the box and under the hood, so I'll just write what I think about it.It works...and works good!Not the best, but better than decent. Techies (and I am a techie) can tell its low end...so don't buy this if you are a techie or need it for business use (but it might be good for a backup phone). I don't care about billions and billions of apps I could download, which tempt me to spend billions and billions of dollars on in-app purchases.all the apps I need are on Windows Phone.Plus you get the added bonus of Xbox style music playing and OneDrive integration (which was recently boosted to 30GB of free storage for all, almost the size of the biggest MicroSD that you can put in it).But like I said, it's mostly my wife's and it works good for her.She can't tell the difference in lowered specs going from a Nokia 925 to a Blu Win HD.If you want, you can check out what apps are available at http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store.I don't know about you, but the Windows Phone, to me, just looks so much more fun than iOS or Android phones.But Having an almost $400 dollar phone break down on me in the first 6 months reminded me that I really hate spending the same amount of money on a phone that I could in building a better than average PC.So that experience really soured me on spending big bucks on something that can break so easily.BLU Win HD does everything my wife needs, it looks pleasant, and is fun enough for her without sucking her time because of drowning in apps, and it is unique enough in it's own right.She has her Yahoo account, her Outlook account, Pandora, JW.ORG apps, internet, weather, texts, audio/music (including the $.99 Ocean Waves by Joe Baker Mp3 file that's over an hour long.

Fantastic phone to make the jump in to the Windows OS,"I purchased this phone to play with Windows Phone 8.1 Software, have a backup phone, and the dual sim ability. I am going to try and review the phone and not the OS itself as there are plenty of places reviewing the OS. But if I had to review the OS, it seems great, kinda like a feature phone on steroids where all the built in apps cover all your needs and work pretty much flawlessly.Packaging: The packaging looks great. It was sturdy and everything was wrapped very well. This put my S3 packaging from Samsung to shame.Accessories: Phone comes with a charger, usb cable, 2 screen protectors (one already installed which is sooo awesome for my OCD stupid bubbles), headphones with mic, and a case. Really love the screen protectors and the case as this is a new phone from a smaller company and I may not be able to find those things elsewhere.Phone Itself:Seems to be pretty sturdy and well built. The phone is advertised as yellow but I dont think that is a good way to describe it. Pictures on amazon make it look like standard yellow or yellow/green. This thing is a explosion of neon that makes your eyes squint when you look at it. Matches a neon yellow highlighter. The case tones it down to a more natural yellow.There are two sim slots, a standard size one for slot 2 and a smaller version for the main sim. Front has a proximity sensor, front camera, and a speaker and a mic. Back has a LED, main camera, and a pretty loud external speaker. The back does take a little care to put on to cover the battery. I have a fear the clips on it may break at some point as they feel a little brittle. USB Port is on top and can be difficult to use other cords with the case installed.MicroSD works fine. Just put your photos and music on it after you load the phone up and hook it to your computer. OS really doesnt search for things that are not put in the right folders on that card.The screen seems sharp and a little brighter than my S3. Still have some problems reading things when its really bright outside. Maybe its just the phone color blinding me (/sarcasm). Everything seems to be sharp and I dont really notice any color distortion. Also not sure how well the screen takes scratching since its not gorilla glass. If the screen is the same material as the black parts on the sides it may be a little soft.The windows buttons seem responsive. Wish they had a back light. Also wish there was a notification light. Side buttons are responsive. Power is a little hard to hit with the case on.Battery life appears to last 2 days... But I have only had it for less than a week. This may change.Processor seems fast and I havnt noticed any lag. Seems to play games, youtube, netflix, etc.Modem seems to work fine and I have decent signal for where I live. I am using T-Mobile. Note: this phone does not have LTE. Its HSPA+ only.Camera works fine and pictures seem on par with S3. Video recording at the moment is NOT 1080p. Not sure if that can be fixed with software. Currently contacting the company on this. LED flash seems bright, I use that mostly as a flashlight so I cant comment on how well it works with pictures. I will update picture quality when I get more time to play with it.Front camera is like others... Gets you face across but nothing you really should use for pictures.GPS. See update 4 bellow.Call quality seems great. I can hear the other party clear and they can hear me. Doesnt appear to have noise cancelling but no biggy.Summary: The phone has exceeded my expectations and I am happy I purchased it. It is sturdy and runs the OS beautifully. The price is a great point for buying a nice phone off contract, especially if you want to try out the Windows OS.Pros: Fast, Sturdy, Great Price, Sharp Screen, Comes with screen protector and case.Cons: Needs notification light, at the moment not 1080p as advertised, no LTE.I will update as I use it if things change.Update #1: Did some research on the processor. It might be able to record in 720p but it cant do 1080p. Sent another email to Blu for explanation of the 1080p.Update #2: Well two emails and a message through their website yielded no response. Tried calling today and was on hold for about 30 minutes. Reached someone and the call had lots of static and she put me on hold. When she finally came around with a answer the call dropped. I was on a land line, so either her side was bad or she hung up on me. Maybe I will call later.Update #3: Phone does not support 1080p per manufacturer.Update #4: Seems like the GPS locks fast but the Windows OS does not include turn by turn directions, just directions. Looks like you have to purchase another app to get that feature. Not a big deal as I use dedicated GPS. The map is still very useful in the sense that I can download the map ahead of time and easily request traffic data to plan my city commutes. Seems better than google maps in that aspect.Update #5: I take back what I said about the camera. The camera is just OK. Takes pretty noisy photos in low light and its flash doesnt help much. S3 had much better consistent shots. Otherwise had it a couple of weeks now and seems like a nice phone. Its not LTE but the HSPA+ seems pretty good in the Denver Area. I am getting speeds in the 12-15Mb range which is fine for me. Calls keep coming in clear and phone does everything I need it to do well enough. Battery can last me two days if I let it, but I am not a heavy user.",2014年10月4日 在美国审核

On paper they look like excellent value for the money,"This phone was for a friend of mine who was kind enough to write a review. This is his review in his own words, not mine!I’ve been curious about the Blu Windows Phones for a while. On paper they look like excellent value for the money. I finally decided to get a Win HD for a backup phone as the Lumia 520 I have is really small and I’m using it for more of a SIM free mp3 player sort of thing.My Blu Win HD arrived just about one week ago…What it doesn’t do or doesn’t have:No GlanceNo Double-Tap to WakeNo Lumia Firmware and all that comes with that; Lumia Camera, Gestures Beta, etc.No Sensor Core goodiesNo LTEIt didn’t set up my APN &amp; MMS automatically from my SIMNow that the above is out of the way, let’s talk about the actual phone.One week in and I’m satisfied this is a phone I can use on an extended basis. Battery life is very good with the 2200 mAh battery and the efficient Snapdragon 200 SOC. That part surprised me the most, even after studying the spec on paper and looking at some user reviews. And battery is important to most users. I’m a light to moderate user, so I’m getting 2 and 3 days out of my Win HD between charges. I like that.The display is better than I expected. It looks very sharp at 294 ppi. It’s 720p with 720 x 1280 pixels on the 5” diagonal display. I will say also that I am biased toward IPS LCD such as is included on the Win HD. I just favor it over AMOLED. Other users will disagree and that’s fine too. I like the more natural tones of LCD. There are no Brightness or Color Profile settings, but the firmware seems to have dialed in the display to a nice point that is at once lively and usable. One thing to note: the automatic brightness adjustment doesn’t seem to want to compensate for bright, direct sunlight. I don’t know why. Keep Brightness toggle in your Action Center so you can toggle to medium or high manually to compensate. A quirk that disappoints on an otherwise very nice display for the money.The screen itself is plastic – not glass. I can see where that saved them a few dollars. The Blu Win HD comes with 2 screen protectors. 1 installed and 1 in the box, right? Some complain about the screen protector and the screen itself being over sensitive. My unit was an “opened box” deal on Amazon. I saved about $40, but there were no screen protectors; either on the phone or in the box. Raw, the screen was way sensitive and has an odd feel to it. The firmware has it dialed in sort of touchy. Fortunately I found a nice item at the local Walmart. Hard plastic type screen protectors that are supposed to be “trim to fit” and are actually the perfect size. It covers side to side perfectly and from the very top of the panel all the way down about 3mm past the bottom edge of the display. The capacitive buttons are not covered, but I don’t feel any seam from the screen protector. With the hard plastic sheet I get a better feel and the sensitivity isn’t a glaring deficit. There are occasional unwanted taps, but much fewer and I’m learning there is a way to scroll on this device to avoid that issue. Never hesitate and use a firm touch.Buttons. The buttons on the Win HD are at the top of the phone’s sides. Upper right is Power. Upper left is the Volume rocker. Careful how you hold the phone when you squeeze that Power button. I’ve gotten lots of accidental screen shots by pressing Volume + and Power without meaning to. Two and a half years on Lumia phones makes for some hard to break grip habits. LOL.I chose Neon Orange for my phone’s color. I like it a lot. It’s very vibrant. Looks almost edible, like a sorbet. The included TPU case is a nice match and provides a good grip and adequate bump protection. I’ve not used the included headphones (white), but the charger and cable are very nice. The cable is a bit on the short side, but that is the trend now – saving money by giving out short cables. Overall I find the phone very attractive. It is slim and easily pocketable. There is a bit of heft to it that belies the plastic construction.There is a removable back, removable battery, two micro SIM slots and a micro SD card slot. All very nice and easy to access. I’ve inserted a class 10 SanDisk 32GB card I have that I’ll swap between the Win HD and my 520. No issues with read or write and it plays music and video quite nicely off the card. I’m the type to only put disposable media on card so don’t ask about App speed.I am using a Straight Talk AT&amp;T compatible SIM. It is a nano SIM because of my 1520. I have an adapter with a tough plastic sheet for a backing. A bit of double sided sticky tape and the nano stays put in the adapter. No issues with insertion or removal in the Win HD’s slot. I’m only using one SIM, but can say the Blu dual SIM is set up as an active system where you can decide what each SIM is for and can use both simultaneously. The phone did not read my SIM for data and I had to manually set up my APN and MMS. No biggie. Any user should always be prepared to do so. Removing the SIM and reinserting it is fine. The Win HD remembers the SIM and goes back to your settings.I set up some Bluetooth headphones with the Win HD. No issues pairing and remembering them. Using the Bluetooth headphones is just as it should be; no button press issues or any difficulties to report.Calling. Calls on the Blu are clear and clean sounding. On the handset, on the speakerphone, on the Bluetooth headset – the sound quality is there. Volume is a slight concern. I like to have reserve volume for when things get noisy on my end. With the volume maxed the calls are just slightly loud. There really isn’t much need to turn it down even one notch. But if things get noisy, there really isn’t any upward adjustment left. Headphones show the best possibility in this regard and if you have a dedicated Bluetooth earpiece I can see that being a plus when paired with this phone. Data. The Blu Win HD gets the fastest H+ available: up to 42.2 mbps and my phone has shown no issues keeping and maintaining a data connection with my carrier. The antenna and radio in the Blu is as capable as any I’ve used and my signal lock is outstanding for voice and data.Out of the box my phone had Windows Phone 8.1 and immediately updated to 8.1 Update 1. I believe the Blu phones got Update 1 just before Christmas, 2014 which puts them near the head of the pack of Windows Phones for fast update. This bodes well for Blu supporting the platform and I hope Update 2 comes to me quickly for this handset. Time will tell on that as well as answering the question of Windows 10 coming to this device. I’ve poked around on this phone pretty comprehensively. Blu did not add anything to the OS. There is no “skin;” no Blu Apps, add-ons or oddities. Think “AOSP” and you’ll see where the Blu is coming from. They didn’t add any value to the OS, but they also didn’t mess it up by tinkering around…Snapdragon 200 SOC, 8GB internal memory (but you can expand that via microSD slot) and 1 GB RAM. The phone runs pretty smooth. For every day chores the phone zings along just fine. I do see a bit of lag in my Uphill Racing. I’m not sure why. Maybe I need to try with data off so it isn’t loading ads. I’ve not seen lag anywhere else – even somewhat high bitrate videos in MoliPlayer Pro. I’ve not done any intense gaming, but I don’t really do that on my high end phones either. Maybe another user will address that area more fully. I wouldn’t expect the world out of the quad core 1.2 GHz CPU and Adreno 302 GPU combo. Great for every day – maybe not so much for power play. Let’s remember this is a value device.While we are talking about hardware… The Blue Win HD has an accelerometer, proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor. Not all of these are present on every budget device so take that into consideration when checking specs. There is no compass and while I would like one it isn’t really a deal breaker for me. As I mentioned earlier, no issues with Bluetooth. Also no weird WiFi problems. GPS seems to work without issue and at acceptable speeds (seems faster than my 520 and about the same as my 1520), USB works as expected and there is an FM radio on board (which, of course, needs a wired headset for an antenna). For in App use the speaker actually was pretty loud, yet still clear. The volume in App is a direct contrast to in call where there was not as much range.It is worth noting that I have not once felt this device build up heat. Kudos to Blu on that...Let’s talk about the cameras… They don’t have that Lumia firmware tweak to them. They are serviceable QCAM-AA models that are rather generic. I’ve found them to be adequate. Don’t expect too much from them and be ready to work a bit is all. I think their shortcoming is in direct sunlight. There you may have to play with the white balance or exposure via manual settings. Microsoft Camera is the default camera App. Do yourself a favor and get some other camera Apps to help beef up what the 8MP rear and 2MP front cameras are capable of and to expand your editing options.Here are some sample pics:Normal interior during the day, 2MP front via Microsoft Camera, automatic settingsBright daylight outdoors, 8MP rear via ProShot, automatic settingsEarly morning shot with snow taken in the shade, 8MP rear with Microsoft Camera, automatic settingsThe picture of the tree was taken on an overcast day with snow, 8MP rear via Camera360 Sight, automatic settings and post shot autocorrect + filter applied.In conclusion: I think the Blu Win HD is a worthy all around for budget shoppers and a good buy for those flagship users who want a decent backup without breaking the bank. I’m very pleased with my purchase and glad I took time to explore this worthy device. I’d buy it again or recommend it to another. This is an especially nice bargain if you can catch it on sale.Pros:The screen looks greatThe styling is very hip and freshGood all-around handling of the no-frills OSFast updates (?)1GB RAMSensors includedSD SlotBattery life and removable batteryZero heat issuesDual SIM (active)Value for the moneyCons:The firmware is a bit less than Lumia users expectCameras need manual love to coax the best out of themButton placement is a bit awkward",2015年3月31日 在美国审核
Buy the BLU Win HD 5-Inch Windows Phone 8.1,"I bought this phone for work and it is currently using USA 4G AT&amp;T. I have to say this is a really nice phone.

Also 3 days with facebook loaded and receiving updates. Always seem to have signal too.

"LOVE the phone, needs MORE 3rd party cases...","First a bit of a disclaimer...let me state that I bought this phone for business use, so I don't really use the camera except for receipts, nor do I play any games.I was using a Lumia 920, and after replacing two dropped and cracked screens, I decided that instead of replacing yet another screen, I would buy one of these.I'll fix the 920 down the line, but for now, this phone is proving to be fantastic!I love the look, the size is perfect for me (I'm a bigger man, so this fits in my hand perfectly).If anything, the phone is almost too light, considering the heavy brick that the 920 is.But once my hands got used to it, I was off and running, and never looking back.4/29/2015: UPDATE - Still loving the phone.But had an incident where the Windows OS locked up, and would only boot into a bitlocker recovery screen.I tried everything and nothing worked.I opened a case with BLU, and sent the phone in the next day.The same day that BLU received it, they called me to tell me they were sending me a brand new unit.BEST Custer Support I have experienced in a very long time.I just wish they made phones for Sprint to replace my personnel phone.Transfer from my old Lumia was quick and easy...I plugged in the SIM, threw in a microSD card, and I was able to make calls.The hardest part of the transfer was getting my corporate email set up.But all told, ina half hour, I was back up and running and syncing my corporate email.The display looks good to me, and seems just as responsive as my 920 was.I'm also an Android user, but I personally love the Windows 8.1 phone...it's definitely a businessman's phone.And this BLU phone is to me a perfect replacement for my 920.Now, my only CON...where are the after market cases?It's nice that they included the gel case, but I want something that looks a little more professional.",2015年3月4日 在美国审核

So close!,"This is my first Windows phone experience, and I must say it is a pretty good one...at least as far as the operating system goes.The phone is the perfect size to fit in my pocket.It is narrow, thin and light.The screen is big and bright and comes with a somewhat poorly installed screen protector on it.Luckily there is also a second one included in the box.The phone is easy to use, except for me the back button is on the wrong side of the phone.While holding it in my right hand, it is a challenge to hit the button on the left side without dropping the phone.The sound is good and microphone is clear.I have had a few problems making calls and sending texts because I have a SIM in slot 2 (standard size) and its default is to do everything from slot one.My biggest complaint is how the phone will scroll through emails, contacts, or whatever it wants when I have it plugged into the car charger.I thought I was getting power surges of feedback through the power port until the same thing happened while charging at my desk.When it's plugged in, I can't type a text or email without garbled words or a flashing screen.My mouse even stops working when near it during charging...concerns me a bit about how much EMF it is putting off.It does have great battery life though.I am a pretty heavy user and it will go 1-1/2 to 2 days between charges, something my SIII never could do.I think I will return it, which makes me a little sad.I was really hoping it would be the best phone for me.It is nice, but the fact there are no aftermarket cases or screen protectors and the crazy charging issues makes it a deal breaker.",2014年10月7日 在美国审核

WINDOWS TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!,"Hello Windows Lovers and Friends, I am going to keep it short and sweet with this one. First, I was so scared to get this because of all of the Snapdragon 200 talk possibly not being able to power this large 5 inch screen. But I got this phone anyway and just said **** it. I have been using the phone for 3 days now and I am absolutely blown away. I have always been a person that would wait to get a phone that I wanted from like Craigslist after the price drops to ****. I do not believe in making a mortgage sized payment for a cellular device that will be ancient in 6 months. The price appealed to me right away. The look got me overall because yellow is my favorite color and I am named after a different shade of yellow as well. :) Screen: THE SCREEN IS ******* LOVELY! Wow. I was expecting a lot of choppiness and lag here and there. Its no big deal at all. Im convinced you'd just have to be trying to give yourself a seizure from all the screen jumping to notice it. Its huge and a deep black. It feels very smooth and tough. The colors are soooo bright and deep. Nothing looks super bland or washed out. The phone itself feels very sturdy and well put together. Its soooooo THIN! I haven't dropped it yet, so I don't know if it is FORD TOUGH, but I will let you know. Videos in HD: I DONT KNOW WHO WAS HAVING PROBLEMS, BUT IM NOT! THE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE LOOK GREAT! I HONESTLY THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST VERY GLASS HALF EMPTY GOING INTO THINGS. ITS A SHAME. REALLY SUCKS THE FUN OUT OF GOOD DEVICES LIKE THIS. I don't play games..so I don't give a **** how they function here. The phone is super fast at closing programs. That immediately stuck out at me when I was pressing the X. Im in love yall!!!!! I just love it yall!!!!!",2014年10月10日 在美国审核

I can't install apps on my SD card.,"I can't install apps on my sd card.I've contacted BLU support customer service today and they told me that as I live in Venezuela they can't offer me a guarantee nor change my phone and they told me that the problem comes from the software because the SD is detected and its usage is normal so it cannot be the hardware and the phone itself but they told me to contact with you and ask about this.As I didn't find a new way to install the OS to the phone I installed the preview for developers and the problem still persisting. I realized about this:Variant 1: If I've made a hard reset and I set the storage of apps to the SD card (which supposedly have apps installed previously) the first time the store opens correctly but the download says pending and gets hang there and the app never install.If I try to open the store again it says that it cannot connect to the store, try again and it opens and ask me to wait a few seconds until my download is done but it never starts to download and hangs on ""pending""Variant 2: If I've made a hard reset and the SD has been formatted, the store opens correctly and allow me to install apps to the SD card but when I restart the phone the icons in the start menu disappear and if I try to open the app it says ""loading"" but never open and the store says that can't connect.Also if I try to move apps from the phone to the SD card or vice versa it says for 3 seconds moving but it never does.Variant 3: not exactly about the installing process but is an related issue, when the icons of the apps installed on the SD card are gone, If I change the SD and introduce the other one, the icons get back but it says that the apps are not installed on the phone so it cannot be opened.What do you think about this? It seems that it really is a software problem and it is related to the store.I tried what the people of MS Answers told me and got no solution.It's not a matter of the size of the SD card because I've tried with a 8 GB one class 4 and the problem is the same, Any help or explanation is welcome.The phone works flawlessly in almost everything but it doens't allow me to install apps on the SD. There's no way to do it, The SD car can be read (64gb xdhc) I can styore almost anything there less apps and the store fails opening and says that can't connect.I called blu and they told me that they can't offer me help because I live out of the US (Venezuela) and told me to contact MS because it doesn't seem a problem of hardware. At MS answers they tell me to return the phone to amazon but I don't have the upper part of the box cause someone put it to the garbage by mistake in may absence, I'm lost with this and I don't know if I can still return it to amazon. Now I am even ready to buy another cheaper phone like a Lumia 535 but it wasn't the idea because I'm sacrificing the good stuff of this phone like sound and battery life for a phone with a bad responsive screen and less ppi",2015年1月6日 在美国审核

If you believed the inaccurate product description in Blu's website and this Amazon page think again. here is my email to Blu and their response follows:Hi,As the subject line explains…cannot record in HD, or play HD video from YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, the web browser or from anywhere. Trying to play HD video only causes video to almost come to a stand still, while the audio continues normal playback. The only resolution I can play without problems shows a grainy, low quality video. And my internet connection(wi-fi) is at 60 Mbps.Going into video seettings in the camera app only shows three resulutions available: 864x480, 800x480 and 640x480.Searching the webfor answers just reveals other people are having the same issue. Until someone pointed me to Qualcomm specs sheet for the snapdragon 200 chip. It clearly shows that it only supports 720 video playback and capture.So, how can I capture 1080p on this phone?Please clarify.Thank you,Their response:Hello,Thank you for contacting BLU Products.

"Good backup phone for its price, not recommended for use as primary device","Had this phone for about 4 months now.Pros:- dual sim, can take overseas as an international phone- durable, dropped it a few times and didn't do any damage- comes with case and screen protector already applied on the screen- is ok as a backup phone when your main smartphone is in repair or so- large screen, very nice to watch videos- calling is good- battery lasts entire dayCons:- poor screen resolution, looks pixelated when looking at pictures- horrible camera, pictures are unstabilized, fuzzy/grainy, and warped- screen often thinks you are tapping when you are scrolling, this is a nightmare when you are scrolling through a page of links.. phone begins registering taps everywhere- windows mobile does not have many big name apps, such as youtube and instagram- shipped me the wrong color case (I have a yellow phone, they shipped the orange case not the yellow case)- laggy- cannot play youtube videos very well, always play on HQ or LQ, never HD- videos above a certain resolution start flashing green- phone freezes often- with the case on, charger does not stay in the phone.. keeps popping out because case is too thick. Only the charger that BLU provides you will stay in the phone- Cortana is useless and annoying- face will hit mute button during calls a lot- speaker is on back of phone, cannot lay down phone and play music without speakers being covered- does not navigate through webpages very smoothly. Lots of lag and random clicking when you are scrolling. Hard to zoom in and out.For the price this phone is pretty good. Whenever I have problems with the phone freezing I just take the battery out and restart the phone. This phone is a backup after I cracked my galaxy S4 screen. I will keep this phone after my new phone arrives and use it as a back up whenever I cannot use my primary phone. It is reliable for calling and texting.",2015年4月29日 在美国审核

It occaisonlly locks up and you have to take the battery out before it will work again and the sound is okay on it but sometimes you are not able to hear that well partly due to the speaker being in the back so you have to turn speaker to your ear then turn in back around to speak in to the phone. the only use i have for it is the office feature and so it works for the price.

Complete disappointment. Don't bother.,"What a disappointment of a phone. Windows really out-did themselves with the OS upgrade to 8.1. Hats off to Microsoft. As far as the phone is concerned, however...after I ordered the phone for the first time, it worked great for about 1.5 days. After that, the volume buttons just stopped working. Wouldn't have minded if the phone had a software application in the settings to control the volume (kind of Microsoft's fault but no big deal). One would think the hardware buttons would last a little longer than a day and half.So, I called up Amazon and they shipped out a replacement to arrive the next day. It did (awesome customer service Amazon). Except this time with the phone, the Bluetooth stopped working after 2 days. Hmm notice a time-table here? The Bluetooth would be on but it wouldn't connect to anything.Save yourself the trouble. It's not worth it. I read other reviews claiming it was good for the price but I've purchased phones for half of this price that lasted well over a year (Nokia Lumia).",2014年11月21日 在美国审核

Device looks amazingly beautiful. But not functional,"Device looks amazingly beautiful. But not functional. I got my first device on Saturday on one day shipping. Unwrapped, booted up , didn't put any sim card, but connected using the wifi. all good, after 10 minutes , it asked to install an update for BLU. Installation started and it got switched off in the middle of the update installation. It never turned on after that. Kept it over night on charging, No luck on Sunday morning after a night charging.Sunday morning I placed a replacement order on Amazon. I got the package delivered in the afternoon. This time I put the sim card, but connected to wifi as well. booted up fine, but sim card is not detecting. Checked the update to see if that will fix the problem , though not sure if it will ever come back after update. Update got downloaded, installed successfully this time. But no luck with sim card.brought the phone to office today where signal is all-bar to see if its a signal problem. No luck here at office as well. Also noticed that the device reboots every 15 to 30 minutes as somebody else mentioned in the review; in short, this device looks awesome, but not usable. Returning it today. I'm so disappointed that I cant use this awesome looking device.",2014年11月10日 在美国审核

The platform lacks a lot of the important apps, and a lot of the apps that are there like Audible, Facebook, Twitter, etc lack the features on iOS or Android. I use all three platforms and this OS has a long way to go. Secondly, about the phone. It's a poor build quality, yeah I know it's cheap, but you'll get a better build quality out of the Nokia phones for a cheaper price. The back cover doesn't securely stay attached, you can hear and feel it move around at the bottom. Also the processor is so bad you can see the UI lag while scrolling through the start menu.

DO NOT BUY!!!! Please read my review....,"THIS PHONE SUCKS!!!!, Cortana rarely works, I cannot transfer contacts via Bluetooth, transferring contacts was extremely difficult. Speaker phone volume very, very faint. Almost zero information concerning how to use the features on the phone or support from Blu helpdesk. Just check out www.bluproducts.com and see how much information you can find about this phone? Lots of selling information, but zero technical information. I have had the phone for 6 weeks now and now it has locked up and the touch screen does not work, SO I CANNOT RETURN IT FOR A FULL REFUND because of course I have exceeded my 30 day return policy window. I called Blu helpdesk for help and all they could do for me was to perform a Cold Re-boot, which wiped all my information off of my phone, Contacts, Apps, Pictures, Everything. Helpdesk absolutely useless, they had not information on how to get my contacts or the Apps that I had already purchased back on my phone. My suggestion is that you purchase a phone at one of your local wireless providers stores in your area, that way if you have any issues you can take the phone back into the store and get the help and support that you should get, especially when you are spending almost $200. for a phone. BUYER BEWARE, Pass on this phone buy one local, because if you have ANY ISSUES at all you will get NO HELP from Blu, but just to reset your phone and LOSE ALL YOU INFORMATION.

Nasty!!!!!!,"I couldn't believe it when I receive this cell phone. Ihad placed an order for a NEW cell and when we finally receive it due to weather. This cell was used, chipped, dirty, and it had dead human cells and hair on the inside of the back cover!!! (yes you read it right). They left out a lot of accessories- I didn't even have a charger. I order my husband phone on the same day and from Amazon and he had everything from a cover to earplugs. Me and my husband didn't even know it was like that until we went to the store to get it activated. As we were sitting there waiting I happened to pick the phone up and saw the chipped paint and the overuse of the charger outlet. When I explain to the representative that I had to return it (after almost 2 hours of sitting there) he happen to turn the back over and that when I saw the dirt, dead human cells and hair. The representative was shock his-self and thought that we were just switching over a old phone and ask if we wanted some hand sanitizer. I was so embarrass. I have always order from Amazon and never had to check behind their products. I am so surprise this came from Amazon. Now I have to wait on another phone.

"So far so good, I am impressed with BLU Products take on Windows Phone","I felt like I stepped in a time machine when I opened the box and realized all the accessories that came with it, long gone are the days when the manufacturer would give you these type of extras: Case, screen protector and earphones.The phone itself is pretty light weight, it has a removable back, expandable memory (up to 32gb) and dual sim card input one is a micro sim and the other is standard. This phone is not LTE but I have gotten HSPA+ most often and my avg DL speedis about 10mbps but I'm sure data speeds will wildly vary based on a number of factors, but for me its not that important.Gaming on the phone is pretty good, I thought it would have performance issues since it has a snapdragon 200 processor but to my surprise it handles gaming pretty smoothly. The screen is also very vivid, and unless you are one of those over the top pixel peeping types you wont have any issues with this display.It does not have a dedicated camera button which I have grown accustom to, (coming from Nokia) and the camera on the phone isn't all that great, in fact, max resolution for video is a depressing 864x480 but for a budget phone I really cant be that upset about it.I don't much care for it displaying sim 1 and sim 2 options all over the place for your phone calls and text messages, but this is just a small inconvenience and I wish i had the option to remove or disable sim ports that I wont be using, but this is really more of a personal preference than a shortcoming of the phone.After setting the phone up I was notified of available updates and I hope this is a sign of things to come with how Windows phone updates are supported, my previous carrier, tmo seemed to drop support almost as soon as they sold the device.Overall I think this is one of the better lower mid range options for a windows phone if you are in the market for one and want to spend less than $200 I am considering handing this one off to my wife and purchasing one in white when they become available. I will update this review as needed if anything changes, after all I have only spent one day with it, so we are still in the honeymoon phase.",2014年10月2日 在美国审核

Terrible Customer Support and Dishonest Marketing of Phone's Capabilities,"Be very careful when ordering this phone if you intend to use it overseas.There are actually TWO different versions of this phone (one with part number w510u and one with part number w510l). The difference is that the ""l"" version supports the 2100 band for HSPA+ service.The version that Amazon sells is the ""u"" version, which does not support this band and therefore will not support fast data transfers on many MANY overseas networks.Many will be fooled by the Blu website (on which I based my purchase), which lists the Win HD as supporting the 2100 band and does not indicate that there are 2 versions of the phone.Please don't make the mistake that I did by purchasing the wrong version.After 2 hours on hold with Blu, I finally got through to a sales manager who said that, despite the misleading marketing materials, there was ""nothing inherently wrong with my phone"".He therefore would not authorize an RMA so that I could simply exchange it for the ""l"" version.He kindly suggested that I attempt to sell the phone, blaming the mixup on Amazon.Terrible service all around.",2014年11月14日 在美国审核

"Great phone, with few major flaws","I've used three iPhones, latest iPod touch and 4+ Windows Phones since 2008, and now I got BLU Win HD to replace a bricked Lumia 920.Pros:- Price - for 1/3-rd of an iPhone you get a *no-contract*, *unlocked* phone!- Build quality is top-notch. Rear panel is easy to take off, and to put back, it's tight.- 2 SIMs are a must in some markets (I briefly used with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile)- Five-inch screen is really nice, the size is right in the sweet spot!!- Battery life seems better than average (almost 2 days with moderate-to-heavy usage)- It feels nice in your hand, with enough grip, and little weight.- I wasn't going to use the provided case (I rarely do with phones), but when I put it on, I almost fell for it :)Neutral:- There is no dedicated camera button. As a workaround, I added camera to the notification center - now it's a click, swipe and tap away.- The touch buttons at the bottom do not light up.. which is tricky in the dark, but you can get used to finding them.- Latest OS version (8.10.12400.899) doesn't support start-screen folders for some reason.- The neon-yellow color is nice, but a bit too flashy, I'd prefer plain white.- The screen surface (with the factory-installed protector) attracts fingerprints and smudges easily, which can be seen in reflections.Cons:- No Full-HD video recording as promised by specs!- Camera is lackluster -- colors are *very* bleak, the image appears very blurry and washed out (don't mind the 8 megapixels)- Video recording is unusable as is, due to terrible macro-blocking, stuttering, and horrible color reproduction.- Video playback in Bing/MSN apps (News, Health&amp;Fitness) stutters.. sound plays normally, but video is 5-10 times slower - not possible to watch.- The new Netflix app (released on Dec 15, 2014) stutters while playing video - making it pretty much unusable.Annoyances:- While on USB cable, touchscreen loses sensitivity and interprets attempts to swipe/scroll as taps.- While scrolling with finger touching, the image jumps in large increments, making reading experience very uncomfortable.- Even with 1 SIM disabled, there are reminders throughout the UI that there are two SIM slots.- Automatic brightness doesn't work for outdoors. Even in direct sunlight, the automatic setting raises brightness to medium only. When set manually to High - the screen is perfectly readable. This is a major usability FAIL, in my opinion.- Music (e.g. Pandora) over my car's Bluetooth stutters/hiccups every few seconds, making it un-listenable. Non-music podcasts seem to be playing fine. As a result, I stopped playing music :(- When changing audio apps (over Bluetooth) the phone frequently crashes (i.e reboots). I suspect that this is a general OS problem, not specific to the device, as I remember having some glitches like that with Lumia 920 as well.- While pressing Power button to lock the phone, I frequently press Volume Up (it's on the opposite side) at the same time, which takes a screenshot instead of locking the phone.. I wish there was a way to disable Power+VolumeUp combination, because I lock the phone all the time, but never needed a screenshot.Overall, I think I'm going to return this phone, for its shortcomings (unusable camera and other annoyances).",2014年10月8日 在美国审核
Excellant phone for the price - looks and feels more high end,"This Blu HD phone actually looks and feel more than it's price. For $179 unlocked this is a inexpensive phone but you would not know it in your hands.Advantages: - Price - $179 for an unlocked phone is great. - Hardware - very thin and light. Bright colours is nice for some but others may think it too colourful. Feels good in the hand. - Design - looks similar to HTC , the glass looks like it wraps around the case. Nice overall. - Screen - really nice 5"" screen which is not common for this price range. Colours are rich and viewing angles are good. - Accessories - Comes with a clear case, ear buds and a screen protector. Not common for a low to midrange priced phone. - OS - Windows 8.1 looks really great on this phone and has more apps than most people think. At least what people usually need. The interface is dynamic and is an attention getter, much more appealing than the iphone. - Camera - 8MP camera, the camera is what is expected of the phone at this price range. It's not the standard of a Lumia or iphone, but it's good enough. It cames with flash which is not normal for lower end phones. - Storage is only 8GB, but with a 32GB SD card there is more than enough. - There was several firmware/software updates after booting up, so at least it shows that BLu will provide support. - Dual SIM cards - great option for work. Have a SIM for work and also one for personal. Great option you don't normally see.Disadvantages: - Sound - I noticed the sound during a call is lower than expected. It's better when you use the earbuds. - Speakers - Since they are on the back, you don't get the best sound when viewing videos. I wish they were front facing. - Processor - it is a lower end processor but using Windows 8.1 was smooth. The only issue I had was that you cannot play back HD video. Standard video on youtube plays great. - Not gorilla glass. But not expected for a phone at this price range.Overall, this phone is not what you expect from a $179 phone, it looks and feels high end. Great phone.",2014年10月19日 在美国审核
"Great Phone, Great Operating System, Lacking App Ecosystem","I ended up buying a Blu Win HD (White) from another retailer so this review won't show it is a review from a verified purchase.I am a bit of a gadget geek and use a Sony Z3 as my daily driver and have wanted to check out Windows Phone. This is the phone I got to see how the operating system and app ecosystem are in comparison to iOS and Android.To start you will want to update the phone, there were two updates available for mine. Before I applied the updates the phone was sluggish. After both updates the phone runs very smooth and very fast. The build quality is impressive, even for a high end device, and this is priced at the low end of the spectrum. The phone is lite and fits in my hand well.I want this phone to be the phone I use. It looks good, Windows Phone 8.1 is easy to use and looks great. The camera is acceptable for my use, but if you want a top notch camera I would recommend a high end Lumia if you want Windows Phone or a Sony Z3 for Android.The big snag is the ecosystem. There are just not that many apps available. This is like a chicken and egg dilemma, of who will come first. Users want apps and developers want users, but who will move to Windows Phone first? So far neither appear to be making the move.",2015年4月1日 在美国审核
Some caution on a good phone - very easy to activate with AT&amp;T,"First, I work for a Fortune 500 IT company and my area includes Telecommunications. Just a little over a year ago, some of the top guys in IT were using Apple phone. Now the trend became Windows phones, similar to this one, and a big reason is the use of MS Office products on these phones.Everybody who sees my new phone compliments me on the neon-yellow color. Activation with AT&amp;T was very easy - it took about 12 minutes for me to be set-up on a monthly plan for a total of $37 ($10 one time activation, $25 1 month, the $2 taxes). I selected voice only, but can use the internet via Wi-Fi when available. I could use my Microsoft ID from my laptop to backup information. The screen and movements is very similar to the Windows 8.1 on my laptop. It took me some adjustment to a big phone from an IPhone 4s, but the screen quality makes it a plus.Please note - this phone will not work with Verizon, but will work with most other carriers including AT&amp;T. Once you turn the phone on the first time, it will ask for a SIM card. My phone came with a screen protector already installed - alshough it already had 1 air bubble out of the box.The features are great. I love that there are many free apps and you can add to the internal storage with a miniSD card. Definitely a great option rather than having to pay retail for a new iPhone. Plus, it has slots for 2 SIM cards - you can use one for AT&amp;T in the US, and another one in Europe.Now the note of caution: 2 days after I activated my phone, the SIM card stopped working. I went back to the store. The rep said that it happened before to customers buying their phones from Amazon: if the phone is reported stolen, the SIM card will stop working. It is a good idea to check with Amazon Customer Service and give them the item ID (behind the battery) and verify that the phone is indeed OK and not stolen..",2014年11月7日 在美国审核

I have only had one other windows phone and I liked how it operated. Love the new update. I love how I'm always connected with my computer and my phone anywhere I go because there both windows. I would not pay 300-600 dollars for a phone and I got this one for 149 on Microsoft website with everything I ever wanted right here. It's lightweight and I love how big the screen is! This phone is perfect and its PINK! My favorite color! It comes with a case, screen protectors(2) and I don't like them that much. They leave fingers prints and smudges easily. I've been debating taking it off, but I'm scared of dropping or scratching my phone. If it becomes too much I will, but bright side I feel like idc if its a budget phone because it does not seem that way when you actually get it in your hands. Also comes with headphones that I will probably give away because I have some and they don't fit into my tiny ears. I love this phone and thank you Amazon for helping me find out about this phone and thank you Blu and Windows for giving me a phone I can love ❤ 100%!Also it works with Metropcs if anyone wants to know.

PINK PHONE BUYERS BEWARE - 10/9/15,PINK PHONE BUYERS BEWARE - 10/9/15I have purchased the pink phone but it was shipped with a orange case. I returned the phone and was shipped another. The phone arrive again with a orange case. I contacted the seller and he was not able to help me and suggested I return the phone. I returned the phone and purchased it somewhere else (not Amazon). This time I received the correct color case (pink) with the pink phone. Your phone should come with a case that matches your phone no matter what the seller says. I have the orange phone myself (6 month user) with a orange case and I have seen images of the yellow phone with a yellow case. Now I have the pink phone for a family member and through another 3rd party it does indeed come with a pink case.I like the phone a lot. I have previously purchased the orange phone about 6 months ago. The only issue I have with the phone itself is the volume rocker and the power button are close enough on either side that when you try to turn you phone on or make it live sometimes you turn the volume down and you can miss calls.,2015年7月11日 在美国审核
21 days in - Transitioning to this phone from Android/iOS -  STRAIGHT TALK SET UP,"I'll try to keep to the meat and potatoes of this review.THE PHONE;(+) Roughly the spec equivalent of the Samsung Galaxy S3(+) Feels great in your hand and very light(+) Brilliant 720p screen display(+) The speaker projects music nice and loud(-) Camera is pretty awful for a 8MP(-) Not an LTE capable phone, but the HSPA+ is pretty good on t-mobile/straight talk towers.ACCESSORIES;A gripe for a lot of people, it is HARD to find accessories for this phone to protect it. Yes it does come with a little case, but it's rather flimsy. I know I didn't feel comfortable with it as my only line of defense. After a few days of research I found these to work like a charm..1) The ""Tech Armor New 2014 HTC One (M8) Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector"" works as a flawless tempered glass screen protector for this phone. It comes up just about 1-2 millimeters shy of covering the screen completely, but if you center the glass properly it's the best screen protector you could ever find for this phone.2) BLU makes otterbox-esque cases for a EXTREMELY similar phone model called the BLU Life 8. Checking the dimensions on phonearena(dot)com, I found that there was only variations of a single millimeter or two in size.. So I took the plunge on the ""BLU ArmorFlex PC+silicon case for Life 8"" that you can also find here on Amazon for $6. The case is a 9/10 near perfect fit, but you will unfortunately have to trim the top of the case a little bit to make room for the usb charge port. But for 6 bucks, I'm pretty happy with the result.EDIT 3/29: Looks like the case I recommended isn't in stock anymore..But I suppose any case you find for the BL8 should work. A quick search did find a similar model of that case for the BLU Life 8 on ebay for $8. If you're reading this, you might wanna check there.TRANSITIONING FROM ANDROID AND IOS;(+) Having had phones from each OS I can confidently say Windows OS is the middle man between Android and iOS. It lacks the robust options for customization that Android power users prefer, but it isn't nearly as restrictive as an iPhone. If you're tired of taking hours to perfectly set-up and configure your Android, but find an iPhone too restrictive and ""basic"" the Windows OS is great.(+) Minimal bloatware(-) Terrible app support on Windows. With a tiny market share of 3%, developers just don't support this platform. the good news is there are lots of 3rd party options, as desperation breeds innovation.. but you will have to download 2-3 versions of a service to find one that works, or preforms certain functions that another app lacked. If you're entirely app dependent, windows phone may not be a good choice for you. If you don't mind going through the mobile version of websites from time to time, (like for banking services - ie; Bank of America and Chase), then you should be able to tough out anything else Windows throws your way. We also don't have Snap-Chat, by the way.STRAIGHT TALK APN SET-UP FOR T-MOBILE COVERAGEI've seen a lot of forum posts and reviews mentioning people struggling when they set up this phone through straight talk, but almost all I could find were AT&amp;T posts. I found these settings by combining quite a few different threads, and I can only hope that they help someone down the line. You should be leaving all settings blank unless listed below;1) Go to settings and click SIM+Celluar2) Press Sim 13) Sim Name: Straight TalkNetwork Selection: HOME (T-Mobile is also okay, if that's all you see. It will default to HOME when selected and active).Cellular Connection Profile: CellOneManual Internet APN: On4) Press ""Edit Internet APN""APN: wap.tracfoneProxy Server (URL): http://mms.tracfone.comProxy Port: 8080IP Type: IPv45) Back out to SIM 1 settings again and press ""Edit MMS APN""APN: wap.tracfoneMMSC (URL): http://mms.tracfone.comIP Type: IPv4THE BOTTOM LINE;With arguably the most bang for your buck in this price range, It's a great entry level phone to try out Windows. 8/10 is my score.Good hunting my friends",2015年3月1日 在美国审核
An amazing phone without having to use a contract!,"The BLU Win HD phone that I received is a nice bright yellow (Not surprising when BLU is an acronym for Bold Like Us). It measures 69.9mm wide, 144.8mm high and 7.75mm thick (approx. 2-5/8"" x 5-5/8"" x ¼"") and weighs about 5 ounces. It fits nicely in the hand, has very good clarity and is extremely customizable.For those that have never used a data type phone or those that are new to Windows 8, there is a little learning curve. The phone comes with a user's manual that is not very helpful and some of the features or phone capabilities are not terribly easy to find. With a little time and patience, one will be using this phone like an expert in no time.Don't expect to be downloading apps from the Google Play or any other type of app store for android. This is a Windows phone and uses Windows type apps from the Microsoft store. There are many apps available and many are fantastic, but one won't find the amount that you'd find elsewhere. I've read online that it is because the platform for phones is just too new yet.Cortana is a wonderful addition to the BLU Win HD phone. She has a humorous side to her and has some hidden fun features that I won't divulge since part of the fun is finding them. If you want to put a face to her voice, just search online (hint: Halo game) and you will find her.What is nice about Cortana is that she is a learning assistant and will learn from you the more you use her. In no time, she'll be helping you complete tasks and you'll wonder what you ever did without her.The camera works well and takes quite nice photos. The front facing camera is not as impressive as the rear facing one, but I think it works quite well. There is also a built in QR reader, a text scanner that can translate the page you scanned into another language. I scanned a page out of the Spanish side of the instruction manual and it translated over top of the scanned image.The speaker on the BLU Win HD is located on the back and isn't very impressive for music. It's just the basic speaker. It does produce clear voice though and works great for the speaker phone and Cortana. Ear phones are recommended for the best music listening experience. It produces a very good sound when listening to Spotify over my ",2014年10月28日 在美国审核
Love the phone,"I got the white one for Christmas.Love the phone, loving the windows phone 8.1 environment.I had to train myself that this isn't an Android phone, and it's not supposed to be.Integrates with Windows well, makes the usual phone calls and hits the internet as it should do.Works well with Facebook, as I find myself being on that social network, than I usually would in my older Android phone.Navigation software needs some improvement, as I am an avid WAZE user, and waze works OK here.Most apps that I use on a regular basis from Android can be used in Windows Phone, in one app or another.There isn't as much app as there is in Android, but I see it as as long as the apps I need work well, there shouldn't be as many 'bad' ones as they are in both Android and iPhone.Camera takes decent pictures in good lighting.May need to try a few in indoor, and darker, environments.Installed a 32gb card, and moved as many apps as I can to the card.Not that it really needed to, but it's nice to know that I can.I can text and MMS as well as I can in any other phone.Great that Blu makes these available at a decent price for those who don't want to get locked into a contract.In my case, risk renewing a contract and loose my grandfathered in unlimited data plan.Comes with Blu's usual array of goodies, case, screen protector (one pre-isntalled), headphones, usb cable and power adapter.Case fits just fine, but I can see how it can be 'loose'.I don't use any of them, mainly because I have cables and ac adapters and headsets from other devices that I don't wear out.All in all, can't complain about the Blu Win 8 HD, the hard ware, software, or the included stuff that gets packed with the phone.All is good.Thank you Amazon and Blu, and that you to my daughter who got this as my favorite gift.",2015年1月9日 在美国审核

A solid entry in the phone market,"This was my first experience with a Windows phone (I've always had iPhones) so I've been playing with it for three weeks now before writing this review. There is a lot of good to say. I very much like the size - the trend towards larger screens, this one is 5"", suits my particular needs: it's easier to grab in my purse, easier to see the screen, easier to type on. The phone is thin, not bulky at all, but I can see where one might want to be careful if you normally slip your phone into your rear pants pocket as it might bend or break without a solid case. This phone comes with a case, but not one that is solid/strong enough to withstand that. A quick search of after-market cases that would fit this phone didn't turn up too much, but I might not be looking in the right places (in other words: do some googling yourself).Windows uses the tiles, as you can see, for their apps. They are completely customizable, you can move them around pinning which ever apps you use the most on your homescreen and discard the ones you don't use. It probably goes without saying that the number of Windows apps do not even come close to the number of apps for Apple that are available. If you currently use an Apple product, it would probably behoove you to do a check of the apps you cannot live without and see if Windows has that app. I did and Windows had everything that I normally use so I was good with that.The big change: unlocked dual sim. What that meant for me was that because I travel out of the country quite often, I can now cheaply purchase a sim card in the country I arrive in, slip it in the second sim slot and bam, have a local phone number for the country I'm in. No more calling ATT and arranging an international (ie, expensive) plan for whatever country I'm going to be in for a week or two. It's freedom for me. And it's fantastic. Another thing you could do, if you don't use that second sim for travel, is use one of your sim slots for your personal phone line and the second for your business phone line. Lots of different options. It's pretty cool.Another big plus over iPhone: the ability to add memory. No more trying to judge how much memory you're going need like you have to do with the iPhone (I always went too cheap and ran out of memory with my iPhone, gah). You can easily add memory to this phone if you run out.The graphics are good, the sound is good. I listen to audiobooks on it constantly. Battery life is ridiculously long...I've gone as long as three days in between charges. (Jaw drop.)My two biggest gripes:1) The camera is utterly lousy. I was amazed how bad it is. I don't even bother trying anymore. Eventually, I just reconciled myself to the idea that this was an opportunity to buy myself a nice camera rather than just relying on a phone camera as I have for years.2) Bringing this thing out of sleep mode is a pain in the butt as you're blindly groping for the one side button that brings it to life. Doubly hard when you've got their silly factory case on it that makes it very hard to push the button located on the upper right side. Couldn't we have made that easier?3) Color. Look at that. (At least it's easy to find in my purse and let's be honest: who would steal this thing?)For the price, it's a darned good phone. As a secondary phone for those who travel, it's amazing. But even as a primary phone, it's still a good choice.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核
Value priced smart phone,"This is really a surprising value in a smart phone.It comes with all the gear you really need to get started at no extra cost - Surprise!.It is as thin and lightweight as an Iphone and the display and graphics look as good.We have been extremely pleased with the performance of the phone in everything we've used it for thus far, texting, calling and gaming.It has a camera and the one downside to this phone is that the pictures aren't great.But, hey, I have a digital camera to use for when I want pictures.I'm not much of a phone expert and in fact this is the first smart phone I've owned.I'm old school when it comes to cell phones, what can I say?My husband has an Iphone 5 though and he was amazed at what this phone can do for the price.I can't comment on gaming abilities of the phone or technical aspects of it because I know nothing about either of those things.What I can say is that it works beautifully for the things that I need which are calling, texting and access to email, internet.I have not had the first problem with any of those features.I also like the fun color of the case.It really stands out in my purse or on my desk so I don't have to go searching for my phone amid a bunch of clutter.Overall, I have been very pleasantly surprised by this phone and have recommended it to friends and family.If you're looking for a good, basic smartphone that doesn't cost a fortune, you can't go wrong with this BLU Windows phone.",2014年11月4日 在美国审核
Pretty good hardware; waiting to see what Windows 10 brings,"I did not buy this phone from Amazon. I got mine at a Microsoft Store, in dark gray. If I were to buy this phone again, I'd choose white instead of gray.The main thing I wish to note -- and I haven't seen this mentioned -- is that the capacitive buttons at the bottom of the screen are not backlit. This isn't a huge deal, but I didn't notice it until after I made my purchase. It's not enough to make me return it. The buttons at the bottom give haptic feedback (good), but I find no setting to cause screen-touch feedback like in some Android phones. Haptic feedback is important. I miss it when using, for example, a tablet without a vibration motor.Hardware and build of this phone are good for the money, but middle-of-the pack in component selection. The large screen isn't as bright or vivid as my Moto G. It has a degree of lag when doing some operations like opening an app. Scrolling is not laggy, however.I was surprised that my phone came with a screen-protector pre-installed, and another in the box. A small area in the upper left shows an air gap between my screen and the overlaid protector. I'm going to leave it alone; without that gap I wouldn't have noticed there was a screen protector. I'm not usually someone who installs a screen protector but this one gives me some ease-of-mind. I have small scratches on my other phone's screens.I owned a low-end Windows Phone (Lumia 521) that was stolen in September 2013. This Blu Win HD is the only Windows Phone I've used since then. When I set up my Win HD, I said ""yes"" when asked whether I wanted to restore my old phone's settings. The restoration process worked well.I'm very disappointed with the lack of progress in Windows Phone OS since 2013. I expected more evolution and advancement. Also disappointed in the paltry app selection, which should be improved but isn't. App selection is less than expected after eighteen months of separation. More damning is that most apps are mediocre and hobbled compared to their Android counterparts. Not sure if the blame lies with developers (likely) or OS restrictions (also possible). I want better apps and more of them.I sincerely hope Windows 10 Phone yields a prize equal to the suffering and patience the current OS requires.",2015年4月18日 在美国审核

"a good choice for a nice, affordable, unlocked windows phone","I've had this phone for about a week now and love it. I've been using it on Tmobile and everything has worked fine. You can use 2 sims (1 is regular sized and the other micro) but i only used one. Before this i was using a Samsung Galaxy S2.The battery of this phone is very good. It lasts me roughly 2 days. I was barely getting through a day with my old phone. My usage isnt too heavy but a general day probably has: 4g is always open, 2-3 hours worth of reading, &lt;1 hr talk, &lt;1 hr of music, and roughly another hour of general usage.The screen is gorgeous, it clocks in at 294ppi ; my iphone 4s was at 326ppi i believe (though of course much smaller screen) ... but still not bad for a brand i never heard of before getting this phone. It is quite huge though and most definitely not for everyone because of that.The phone is lightweight and thin though; slips in and out of my pocket easily. I got the yellow one and it is pretty eye catching in a good way in my opinion. The camera quality could be better but it is OK.Overall for the price, I would highly recommend this phone package (comes with many nice extras!) to anyone looking for a good affordable unlocked Windows phone.",2014年10月28日 在美国审核
"Nice size, clear screen, easy to use","Ok, so I just got this phone, so many of the features I have not yet tried, but I can tell you that so far it is really great.I have been using an iPhone for the last 4 years and just wanted to try something new. I have a Samsung tablet so I am familiar with the Android operating system and wanted to see how this was different.The menus and interface are really easy to use and easy to customize. Pretty much everything you need to use on the phone is one touch away on the home screen. A secondary menu can be found with one swipe to the left. Everything else you might need is right there.I like having the option to customize the home screen by changing the size of the squares and also what is there.I have not yet downloaded any apps, but I have been using Facebook and enjoy the app.Sometimes when scrolling in programs, the screen sort of skips, scrolling is not a fluid as it has been on my iPhone.The size of the phone is great and the screen quality is crisp.

Great buy for a great price.,"For the price, this is a really great phone.The only small problem I have with this is that every time I try and turn off the phone, I happen to take screenshots.You take screenshots when you press the power button and the volume button at the same time.The buttons happen to be on the opposite sides of the phone, so you apply pressure to both sides when trying to hit the power button.The other thing of note is there is no camera button.You need to launch the camera from the app.The screen isn't as sensitive as say a Nokia, but you quickly get used to that.Performance is good, no issues.Battery life is awesome.I get two days out of the battery when I used to get about 1 day with my Nokia 810.I really like this phone other than those small issues.",2014年12月29日 在美国审核
Great phone if you protect the worthless screen,"Let me begin by saying that I have owned 3 blu phones. They are great phones in the sense of their specs for the price when compared to other phones. In other words; you'll never get these specs for this price from HTC or LG etc... and if you do, the phone won't be as good looking as BLU. They make really nice looking phones; aesthetics to me is completely important when looking at phones. Battery life of these things are incredible especially, again, when compared to similar phones. I don't expect that you will be unhappy with this purchase unless you are used to Iphone and aren't ready to move away from yet. In that case you will be extremely unhappy; but then again, you will unless you end up with another Iphone.On another note... PLEASE GUARD THE SCREEN WITH YOUR LIFE.2 examples from my other 2 BLU phones.1. After 3 months of ownership, I was at a restaurant. I had the phone in my pocket and had removed it to look at the time. I put it back in and after a few minutes, I looked at the screen, and it was cracked. It made no sense because I hadn't moved or hit it against anything, and it was in a case!. No worries, it's just a silly crack: think again! Even though it was a hairline crack, the screen wasn't responsive at all. I couldn't make calls or receive them (couldn't slide the answer button). That night I got home really late and wasn't able to contact anyone because of my lack of mobile and home phone. Thanks BLU.2. Days after I bought a BLU life 8 which had a ""better"" gorilla glass. This was true as I dropped this phone about 10 times from pretty high distances and nothing ever happened. But a few days ago, while sitting on a chair, the phone slipped off my lap and the screen cracked again. I grabbed it and to my surprise (really) the screen didn't respond to my touch... ""WTF"" I thought.... ""I'm never buying a BLU again"". Three days later and I am now a proud owner of ANOTHER BLU phone.but why do I keep coming back? well its their damn competitive prices. I tried, and I promise, to look for an inexpensive phone with a descent camera and I couldn't find anything!So go ahead and buy the phone, you won't be disappointed, unless you've never used a windows phone (which is a whole different story). But please, for the love of humanity, buy the biggest ugliest case you can. wrap it in a pillow if you have to because God forbid you get a flat tire, get out of the car to inspect it, and drop your phone cracking the screen. You'll have to signal cars down to stop and ask to let them use their phones.Good Luck!",2015年3月29日 在美国审核
"An Ideal, Solid Upgrade From Budget Lumias","The Win HD from Blu is certainly not a flagship phone. This phone best serves those who want an upgrade from a Lumia 500 series phone, but want to keep it budget-friendly. Here's why:1. Front camera and flash.Sure, the camera takes lackluster photos for an 8-megapixel camera. But, it comes with a flash and front camera, unlike the Lumia 500 series of phones. You can now Skype and snap yourself.2. Better processor.The Snapdragon 200 is by no means a powerhouse, but is certainly an upgrade from, say, the Lumia 520's Snapdragon S4. This is offset a little bit because more pixels need more power, but it has noticeably better performance. Don't plan on intensive gaming.3. Better display.The display is yet another upgrade, considering its 5 inch screen, higher resolution and pixel density. This is especially evident after coming from the 500 series of Lumias.4. More RAM.The budget Lumias (5xx) have 512 mb of RAM. This has 1 gb. That speaks for itself, as it handles more at once.5. Longer battery life.This is also very noticeable. You can easily get all day with moderate or heavy usage.Another great thing is that it retains the good things about the budget Lumias, like an SD card slot. It also has a second SIM slot, unlike those Lumias.It's a very balanced phone: it supplies all the features that the budget Lumias lack, except for 4G LTE. And, unlike the budget Lumias, in the box you get a USB wall plug with separable USB cord, a screen protector, earbuds with mic, and a clear protective case. Huge bang for the buck going on here. To boot, it's a nice looking phone and feels less cheap in the hand than the budget Lumias. It definitely apes the aesthetic of the HTC One, but hey, it's a good design that many like.It's a well-rounded phone that isn't really great at one thing, but has all the features. A sensible budget upgrade for those of us who started on the Lumia 5xx phones. The fact that it comes in well under $200 is a wonderful thing.**EDIT 2/26**I have found that this phone does not support visual voicemail, at least on T-Mobile. ""T-Mobile phones"" like Lumias come with the setup, and since this is an unlocked phone, it does not. Hopefully, this issue will be remedied in Windows 10.",2015年2月25日 在美国审核
"Good but not great, one really silly blunder","First, the blunder: you can't turn off the vibration for the navigation keys. I find keypress vibrations to be extremely annoying, and it is just silly that a phone manufacturer would not offer this feature. I googled, and Microsoft says the OS supports an option to disable nav key vibration but the manufacturer has to choose to enable it or something like that. The option is not in the menu where MS says it should be, and the only mention of vibration in the settings only affects keypresses on the screen (the nav keys here are actually not part of the display).The only saving grace with the vibration is that it is weaker than average (hardly a good selling point), so the constant vibration from the home button is not as audible as most phones would be.The navigation keys also do not light up. A lot of phones skip this, and you can get used to their positions (only 3 of them), but it just seems ridiculous that Blu thought that it was so necessary for these same keys to vibrate (an entirely functionless behavior) that they have made it mandatory, but don't care if you can see them.The screen quality is pretty good. Unlike some of Blu's early products, the resolution is high enough that it doesn't assault your eyes with chunkiness. The color and brightness are also roughly in line with most modern phones as well. The viewing angle is not extremely wide, but is good enough that you don't get an unsettling holographic effect.Processing power is definitely where this phone has some issues. This is a complex aspect of a computing device, so I won't pretend to diagnose the exact problem. It can run Angry Birds mostly OK for a long time (with an occasional freeze fixed by locking and unlocking the screen). Another problem, more notable, is that it doesn't scroll smoothly. Whether it be web browsers, file manager, Twitter, or even the phone's own menu system, it moves at a rougher motion than any other phones I have (including an older Nokia Windows phone). Oddly, if you ""toss"" the page and let it scroll under its own simulated inertia, it goes smoothly. But tap-and-drag makes it jump in continuous chunks as if maybe the touch display doesn't have a good sensor resolution. I guess? Whatever the cause, it's good enough to use but not reliably smooth.The body of the phone has a very nice matted finish and the whole thing feels as solid as a phone should.Sound quality is somewhat weak (as is the vibration). Useable, but not a good choice if you want to use your loudspeaker a lot of talk outdoors. Note that, in my opinion, hardly any phones are very good here, so this only makes it average.The camera quality isn't like a high-end Nokia, but is actually a little better than I expected. It's squarely medium among speed and quality.Overall it's an ""OK"" Windows phone, plus the added feature of having a larger display than you normally get in this range. But that might only be true if you absolutely need the Windows OS. This runs about the same price as my 1st generation Moto G Android which doesn't have the scrolling issues, no fascist key vibration, and somewhat better sound. And now the 2nd generation Moto G is adding a larger screen. So the Blu is just a reasonable imperfect mid-range phone, though the Windows OS' lacking as much hardware variety probably makes the Blu a good choice.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核

Nice phone... But still has thing to be improved.,"This is my second Windows Phone. This one is really great - many options, tons of apps, awesome design and appearance.Using it for 3 weeks and so far had only 3 issues I want to share:1) touch screen becomes veeeeery slow when phone is connected to outlet for charging... For unknown reason it takes crazy amount of time to do simple thing like type a text or browse something on the web... Always have to unplug it, finish what needs to be done and plug again for charging...2) At&amp;t Address Book app cannot be used to sync your contacts.I used this app on my previous phone to keep contacts on the cloud. When that phone got broken, I bought this with full believe I be able to sync in seconds but it didn't happen. Although the app got installed, it throws an error. On AT&amp;T website this phone is not listed as supported. Not sure who to blame but wasn't happy to export everything from AT&amp;T manually, importing to Google and syncing from there.3) I have a hidden Wifi BYOD network at work with non-default security protocol. Keep in mind that this phone doesn't allow you to change security to specific types which makes in impossible to use the network. Although I am a software developer, I double check this with my helpdesk support and they confirmed - this phone cannot be configured to use WLAN of this type.At home we use default encryption options so no issues at all.Overall, I would recommend this phone because the issues above are really minor comparing to the quality and comfort this phone brings to my life.",2014年12月27日 在美国审核

I understand that I get what I pay for but the hardware seems to work just fine. Battery life is good,"I'm coming from a Samsung device and have owned Windows phones back in the days of Mobile 7. I bought this phone (BLU Jr.) in March 2016 because it's unlocked and low cost. I understand that I get what I pay for but the hardware seems to work just fine. Battery life is good, screen is bright and responsive, internet sharing works great. The OS is a different story.The Maps app is no good, very difficult to route, show step by step directions, show ETA or find alternate routes when traffic slow. IE crashes constantly. For instance, I will be using Twitter and will follow a link that opens IE. IE will work for about 1-2 minutes, crash, and I'll be dumped back in the Twitter app. IE also does not resize websites automatically for easy viewing. Also, when loading some websites the entire IE app just freezes up, no scrolling, no backing out, for about 30 seconds (I'm guess the site is loading during that time??). Then all of a sudden it works, I'm able to scroll and start reading, but then 2 minutes later it crashes. I also forgot how few apps there are in the Store. There's not even a Starbucks app, really??? Yes, really. Also, for some strange reason connecting to gmail doesn't work (sounds like a Pis**** match between MS and Google to be honest). I've connected multiple Office 365 and Yahoo accounts with no issue. But when I attempt to connect my gmail account the phone says it needs to be 'authorized' and takes me to a website but then that website says ""I don't have Java script enabled and fails. Or it says ""there was an error we cannot fix right now. Please try again later"". Google must be using some sort of crazy fancy e-mail system that bounces laser beams off the moon because I can't believe Microsoft (holders of millions of mailboxes) misunderstands the requirements for connection. There is also an issue with the sound. When using the native music app the volume is too low, even when you turn it up to 30 (the max). But when you use apps like Pandora or TuneIn the sounds seems just fine.I don't remember Windows 7 mobile have all these problems And Windows 8.1 on desktop and Windows 10 work great so I'm not sure what the deal is. If I wasn't so cheap and could get away with buying another Android for under $100.00 I would, but I can't so I guess I'll just have to suffer. Chalk it up to a bad purchase decision, we all have them. Hope this helps.",2016年4月22日 在美国审核
"Not a Nice Experience, or Product.","Ever since the beginning ive had issues, the main one being that the screen will randomly start pressing things, without my input, usually when im working out or at the pool so i assume its the moisture, turning it off, not all the way of just pressing the button, will fix the issue but its quite annoying, the app support in'st great on this platform but i knew that going in so I wont mark it down for that, in the 2 years ive owned it ive had to hard reset it 3 times for various issues, Oh, and another thing i forgot to mention is that the screen, will just bug out, i will be using the phone and press the power button, or it will timeout and turn off, then when i go to turn it back on the screen just displays black, its not off, its just showing black, and it still makes noises, i can hear the unlocking sounds! But the final nail in the coffin is that it just stopped, it shows the BLU splash-screen for a minute, then it turns off, then i turn it on, and the same thing happens. Not a good experience at all, If anyone needs a good phone for a similar price, i would recommend the Nexbit Robin, it runs android, and is more reliable.",2017年6月2日 在美国审核
excellent telephone with some drawbacks,"I was hesitant to purchase this phone, but for the price I couldn't resist and boy am I glad I didn't. After updating the phone and fully exploring the phone, I cannot see myself returning to Android OS. The user interface is clean and seamless and easy to learn to use. The screen is great, and with only 1gb ram it handles like a charm and I consider myself a multitasker. However, they're are three important draw backs: 1. Simply put, the phones video and camera functions suck. This doesn't bother me though because I don't photograph much. 2. Windows OS doesn't integrate turn by turn voice gps navigation which is extremely disappointing. 3. Netflix isn't running on some Windows 8.1 phones, unfortunately the WinHD BLU is one of them. I hope this will be fixed soon though. Fingers crossed! Nevertheless, for the value this phone is a steal!",2014年12月17日 在美国审核
"Great value for a very capable phone: Big screen, upgradable memory, and included accessories make it hard to beat","What comes in the box?Screen protectorScreen carrying caseRechargeable batteryCharger/USB cableEarphonesThe fact that it has its own case and screen protector makes this a great value since I find myself having to spend another $30-$50 just on a case and screen protector.It's not a Zagg but it does work well against scratches.The cover is a flexible color matched case.OperationGUI: Coming from an iPhone iOS, I found this phone to be intuitive to set up and operate.Various functions can be pinned to the home screen, including specific contacts from your Contacts list or apps.Sizes of the boxes can be changed from small to large for more icons to fit onto your home screen but you can always page to the other features, too, if you want to be a minimalist.Applications: Applications are available from the App Store though they did have the Amazon.com shopping application and Kindle App, they didn't have the Amazon Music or Amazon Video apps.Most of my audio library is on Amazon music, which is a disadvantage for me.Camera: The camera option works well for the back facing camera.Image quality is very good for an 8MP camera.Video quality was equally very good.Deleting videos and photos were a chore since I found I could only delete one or the other type, but not both collectively.The front facing camera is decent but the image quality is lower in resolution.SIM card:The ability to accept two SIM cards is a bonus for those who do international travel.It allows for dual functionality without having to buy a separate phone.Menu system: The interface and menu system is user friendly.There are some special features that do allow for safety such as the driving mode which can restrict notifications while on the move.You can even set it so you cannot receive texts or calls when driving.Screen:The screen is a nice surprise.It's clear, bright and very easy to read.There are only 3 levels of brightness which are preset for low, medium and high.External buttons: The home, back and search buttons are strategically placed but not backlit which I presume is to cut costs and save battery life.The power button is on the top right edge, and the volume control is on the top left edge.Radio:FM radio function is possible.The earphones serve as the external antenna.The phone will not receive FM signal without the earphones.Channels can be saved as favorites.Reception was excellent and sound quality was very respectable.It HAS been a long time since I've used a hand held FM radio.Battery life and case: After a few hours of constant use, I was still on half of the battery life.I didn't perceive any excessive heat coming from the back of the case which is common amongst mobile devices.GPS: The phone uses Google maps. The user can go with a satellite or road view.Navigation is excellent.You can even get a local search of businesses and their respective ratings.Nice integrated/built in system that beats how Maps on the iPhone works.Call quality:Digital signal reception is equal to that of my iPhone.No better and no worse.Reception is very good.Storage: Though this only has 8GB of built in memory, the micro-SD slot allows for 32 GB of expansion.That knocks the competition out for many phones with fixed memory built in.Battery :The battery can be changed which is so much easier than having to get $100 service to have someone replace an iPhone battery.OverallI'm very pleased with the phone.It's a stable and highly functional operating system.",2014年10月26日 在美国审核

Nice phone for this smartphone newbie!,"I am new to the smartphone world and jumped at the opportunity to try the BLU Win HD. It is a Windows phone (v.8.1), has a 5 inch display (720 x 1280), and 8 &amp;2 mp cameras (rear and front respectively). The description says it is a 4G phone, but 3G is the max here. The phone has dual sim slots, so can be used with two different numbers. I have not tried that function. It also takes a microsd card (32gb max). It is a slim phone, feels good in the hand and operates as it should. Call quality is excellent and the responsiveness of the touch screen and the speed of processing apps and data appear are good. The case is covered in a rubbery plastic and the phone comes with a case and one screen protector (which I mangled on install - don't do it in a dimly lit room late at night. I can't compare this phone to other smartphones or operating systems (i.e. Android or iOS), but it seems that the Windows phone platform is lagging in the app department. All those apps that you see and want from the Google or Apple app stores do not exist. There is no app for our local cable TV provider for example. While app availability may be less, it seems to be getting better. Often the issue is more about how to find the apps (windowsphone.com is the best spot it seems!). Anyway, as an initial foray into the smartphone world I am very pleased, the screen is big and gorgeous, vibrant colors. The camera is okay, no zooming (that I can figure out) so that is limiting. Apps appear to be catching up but if you are a current smartphone user and want to switch to Windows phone, check out the windows phone app availability if there are apps you cannot live without and see if they exist for this platform. Oh, one cool thing to note. I was having some trouble with the phone (nothing would download to the sd card). E-mailed BLU Tech support (quick response), did a phone reset and all was good. AND the phone remembers everything, all installed apps, phone settings, etc. I was back up and running in under an hour. Pretty cool!",2014年11月20日 在美国审核

"Good smartphone, great photos but still not perfect...","This is an interesting phone; there are lots of things I like and a few things that annoy me about it. This is my second Windows phone and being someone who's more used to Apple products, I have to say I like the Windows phone OS better than I expected.

When I ordered this phone, I assumed I'd have to get these things seperately, but I was pleasantly surprised they were included and it saved me the time and money of ordering additional accessories.The size of this phone is nice, yet it still feels fairly lightweight. I have a smaller smartphone that weighs more than this one.The screen color is bright and vivid and the sound is also good when I'm listening to music or videos.I'm using it with AT&amp;T service and so far, so good. Good sound quality and no dropped calls.The dual-SIM card slots is another useful feature for some people.The battery life is pretty good compared to other phones I have.Like many smartphones, there's limited internal memory, so it's necessary to purchase a storage card.

Limited Support and average all around performance,"In my tests, the BLU Win HD's 1,950mAh battery helped the phone stream a YouTube video over AT&amp;T's HSPA +21 network for 3 hours, 32 minutes, which is better than the Moto G's comparatively poor 2 hours, 26 minutes.If you want to use Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.1 while staying away from contracts, but want to keep under a $200 budget, BLU's Win HD is the phone for you. You won't get a better sub-$200 Windows phone unless you sign up for a new two-year contract. But that's not to say it's flawless, as it doesn't support LTE, its camera leaves a lot to be desired, and it won't fare well with some graphically intense games. Call quality could be a little better overall, too, but it gets the job done.If the Win HD's looks or performance don't match your standards, you may want to check out the ZTE Nubia 5s mini. It's a more expensive unlocked Android phone, but it's more powerful, shoots better pictures, and supports LTE.Find out more about:- ZTE Nubia 5s mini: http://amzn.to/1zKd2Su",2014年12月9日 在美国审核

Great software partnered with the worst hardware I have ever seen!,"I had the phone for about 30 minutes before the volume rocker went bad. From what I saw for the short time I used it, it seemed to be a great option to some of the low priced Lumias, but I don't believe this phone's hardware will hold up next to a Lumia at any price point. I have had several Lumias and never experienced such a disappointment. I still have an old Lumia 900 I use as an alarm that's still going strong! I didn't buy on Amazon, so now I wait to return to the Evilbay seller. The frustration has now turned to sadness. UPDATE: Don't put an sd card in this SOB until you know it's going to work, and you are for sure you will keep it. The SD card is dang near impossible to remove. After struggling with mine for 2 hours I finally got it out. I am now convinced that Blu is selling broken phones so they can get SD cards for free. Biggest POS I have ever owned.

First of all it wouldn't keep a frequency.Every time you wanted to do anything with this phone ( make a call, send 2 text back to back,take phone off the charger etc) there was a ritual that had to be performed. First you had to take the flimsy plastic back off, then remove the battery, put battery back in, put back on, then go to settings page and uncheck WLAN to turn off WiFi. Then go back to home page and click on sim 2 phone or sim 2 text standard card ( micro sim cards don't fit into the slot, only thestandard so dual sim feature is useless).Also u can't disable the sim 1 micro or take it off the home page. Have to choose sim 2 always then make the call. The phone is beautiful and has a great concept. I was able to sync my Google account and contacts by asking cortana how to do it.

"... replace my broken HTC 8X (and upgrade to a better Lumia, such as the 1525","I bought this phone directly from the Microsoft store yesterday to temporarily replace my broken HTC 8X (and upgrade to a better Lumia, such as the 1525, a few months from now). I'm on T-Mobile, so the switch was really easy. The design of the phone is beautiful and fun, and doesn't look cheap at all (though it is a direct copy of the HTC One...). The back speaker is AMAZING and LOUD. The cameras are terrible... So I won't be taking many pictures with this phone. The quality is so poor, and the pictures are extremely blurry. The box came with Apple-esque speakers, a clear phone case that matches the color of your phone (I got yellow), and a screen protector ALREADY on your phone (with an extra one in the box!). The screen sensitivity isn't great, especially noticeable when texting. It's not bad by any means, but I do find myself having to re-type words because the wrong key is pressed, or the phone doesn't register that a key was pressed at all. Again, this is noticeable less than 10% of the time, but is expected with a phone of this price. This phone is excellent for someone wanting to get into the smartphone market or maybe upgrade to something a little bit bigger, but still have that 4-inch phone price. Oh! And the capacitive buttons are nice. Not sure how I feel about the on-screen keys, yet... So glad to hold off on them for a little longer. Definitely get this phone if you want something attractive and affordable. I'm not using it for more than 6 months, but I don't have any worries that this phone would have any issues. And I have read that those who do have issues get good customer service from BLU. Last thing... I know it's a petty complaint, but BLU changed the boot-up and shut-down screens with their logo added to the screen. It's awkward. And there's an extra windows logo screen when turning on the phone. Other than that, the developer preview and everything else was seamless to install, and the transition between phones was excellent because my apps and everything was saved on my MSFT account (including my lock screen picture!). Very satisfied with my purchase.",2014年10月26日 在美国审核
"A great budget phone - 4 stars for Windows fans, 3 stars for everybody else","Update: April 2016: This phone got the Windows 10 upgrade! It's in rarified company; many Nokia and Microsoft phones haven't received (and won;t be getting) the Upgrade to Windows 10. That said, the same caveats apply, as there's nothing in WinPhone 10 that would change the mind of a Windows 8.1 hater.===This is an extremely cheap, good value for the money, Windows 8.1 phone. It's less than $200 off-contract. A Nexus 5 would set you back $350 and an iPhone 5c is $450, so this is CHEAP. It's a US-made phone, with specs almost identical to the Moto G (Android phone) and the same price. For a long while, Microsoft were very strict about what the specs of a Windows phone could be. Once they realized the phone makers were simply not going to bother, they loosened the specs. Manufacturers then began to start making Windows phones by taking their existing Android models, putting the correct buttons on them and installing WP8. That's exactly what Blu have done here.This is a 5-inch phone in a plastic case. It's about as big as I would want to go with a phone - half way between an iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in size - but it's thin and the plastic case makes it light and comfortable to hold. There's a slight bump at the back for the camera, and while the phone doesn't feel premium, once it's in its silicon case, who can tell?The buttons are responsive, and it has a frankly gorgeous 720p IPS screen. It may not be full HD, but there's a high enough pixel density that it doesn't look awful next to your iPhones and flagship Galaxy phones. Viewing angles are fine, as should be expected with IPS, and I didn't notice any color shifting. Sadly, the screen is not strengthened glass such as Gorilla Glass.To counter this, BLU have included two screen protector films. One is already attached to the phone. I did notice that this causes issues at times with the responsiveness of the phone to touch, and it feels like swiping on rubber rather than glass.The camera may have specifications but the sensor is below standard. The rush to higher pixel counts means the image quality lacks that of my 8 year old Sony digital camera, which only managed 4 megapixels, but made them look good. If the rear camera is okay in good light, the front camera is terrible in almost every condition. You'll never get a good selfie here. Might as well forget it's on thephone.The phone has two SIM slots so you can bounce between networks, or maybe have a domestic and international SIM card. It's a great idea and not one I've seen since that phone they used in The Matrix was available in the late 90's. Storage is stingy, to say the least, at only 8Gb (16Gb is a bare minimum for a table phone in my opinion) but you have the option of adding an SD card for extra storage. That's great, but just be aware that if you want more than 8 hours music or a few large apps, you need to factor between $20 and $60 extra into the cost of the phone for the SD card. The max size is either 32Gb or 64Gb, depending on who's provided the specs, so investigate first!While you've got the phone open to add/remove SIMs and SD cards, you'll see the battery is replaceable. How much the battery would cost to replace, I don't know, but it's good to see the option.By the way - the three buttons (back, Windows, search) below the screen are backlit. You'll need to train yourself to remember that (a) they exist and (b) where they are.Now for the contentious part of this review: I consider the OS to be an integral part of the phone. No matter how good the hardware is, it's the OS you spend most of your time interacting with. If you love Windows Phone 8.1 then skip to the end of the review. This is a good WP8 phone.I have used the following OSes: iOS 4 - 8 (hated iOS 4, 5 and 6 on phones), Windows Phone 7 (I really advocated for use of WP7, it was promising) and Harmattan Meego on a Nokia N9.Windows Phone 7 was a pretty positive experience, until Microsoft revealed that the promised 'W7 support' which would last past the launch of WP8 actually meant 'W7 apps will work in W8, tough luck W7 users'. Not only did they stop updating W7 barely a year after it went mainstream in the US, many acres then declined to offer the final W7 update to its users.WP7 was a great start, and I really did believe that it had a chance if MS pushed at it. WP7 certainly is no longer of an acceptable quality as we approach 2015 - that Lumia was passed onto my 70-year old father, who despite having worked in IT since the 60's (using punch tape, mainframes, DOS, OS/2, Windows NT all the way to W7) and being technically minded, found it frustrating and difficult to use. It made him feel stupid, and that made him hate the phone. Surprised by this (I thought it great back in 2011), I looked forward to taking WP8 for a spin.So let's preface this by saying this is my personal opinion, and if you love your Windows Phone, more power to you. I'm not telling you that you're wrong. I'm trying to make potential users aware of some issues.The biggest surprise with Windows Phone is how little it has advanced in 3 years. Apart from the fact you can have more icons on the home screen, it seems very much the same on the surface. The home screen itself looked good on low-res smartphones, where large, simple, two-color icons (tiles) were a good use of limited resources. On this larger, higher-res screen, the fact that 70% of the tiles are the same color makes differentiating between applications very difficult. The settings are still nightmare in which you chase your tail because MS decided to use their own terminology rather than industry standards, or technical where simple would suffice (Storage Sense? WLAN rather than WiFi? Quiet Hours over Do Not Disturb? Ease of Access not Accessibility?). The idea of titles running off screen to the right was good on a small phone, but on a big phone seems counterintuitive.This is not necessarily a bad thing: if you love the aesthetic, you'll love WP8. Most people only change settings occasionally. These are not huge knocks against the OS.The three things that make this OS frustrating for me are:(1) A lack of apps. I don't use many, but there is no Amazon Cloud Player application or Soundcloud application for WP8. The search function in the Store was rotten, too.(2) Performance issues. Is this the phone or the OS? Hard to tell. But when a clean install can't run Angry Birds without locking up (the game kept running but accepted no input for 15 seconds at a time) on a computer with higher clock speed and more cores than a gaming rig from 2000, something's wrong.(3) Reliance on hardware buttons. I found myself inside an email thread in Outlook, and couldn't get back out to the main Inbox. Eventually I remembered the back button (which I had forgotten since it does not light up) and escaped. There's nothing like being made to feel stupid to put you off a product.On the other hand, the killer functionality of WP8 is its impeccable integration with Exchange. I added my work email, calendar, contacts etc in about 10 seconds, and the integration is full, unlike on iOS where if I accept an invite on the phone, I still have to accept it on the computer. This could be enough to sell WP8 to you.So in my personal opinion, this OS still feels two years behind the times. Android would be a better bet, and this exact phone can be bought with Android. Matching specs with the Moto G, that's a compelling Android phone. If you love Windows Phone, this is a really good phone for the money.THE GOOD:Good screen - IPS and 720pLightweightCase includedScreen Protection included, one already fittedTakes SD cards to expand storageDual SIM slots for travelReplaceable batteryTHE BAD:No Gorilla GlassScreen protectors cause sensitivity issuesRear camera poorStingy 8Gb built-in storageTHE UGLY:Front camera so bad it might as well not be thereButtons are not backlit and the OS uses them a lotFinal words: I'm wary of posting this review since I covered the OS, not just the phone hardware. Please don't be like the rabid Bose fans who marked my Bose review as 'Not helpful' because they disagreed with my conclusions.

Great phone for a great price.,"This phone is quite good for its price. The only downside is not with the hardware itself. You are unable to access visual voicemail because of a limitation of Windows Phone. Everything else performed as expected. No noticeable lag. The cameras are good for a low budget phone and it's also great to have a flash. It comes with 2 screen protectors and a gel case (1 screen protector already applied). With the gel case on I do find that the volume rocker is very sensitive. I do not play games on this phone, so I cannot comment on that. Overall for the price this is a great phone for everyday use. Battery life is also great.",2015年3月10日 在美国审核
Couldn't meet basic expectations.,"We purchased this phone for my wife. She's not a power user and the specs would make one believe that this phone could handle simple tasks, like scrolling through apps. Unfortunately we were wrong. The phone had issues from the moment we turned it on. Apps would have issues opening and running, the basic settings screen was choppy and did not register when we tried switching the settings, the screen was washed out, and the camera was terrible. The one nice thing about this phone was it's size, but that is the only nice thing we can say. We were very disappointed with the phone.FYI, this is a dual sim card phone, and there is no way to turn off the 2nd card settings if you are only going to use one sim card. So, the phone will always be searching for a second sim and will constantly make you select the 1st sim card when doing simple things like making calls and texting. It was very annoying to use.",2015年2月9日 在美国审核
Surprisingly Good,"Having used an iPhone for years, I was hesitant to use a Windows phone, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how good this phone is. I like the operating system, which runs smoothly with a practical layout. It comes with a case, headphones and 2 screen protectors, which has become rare with phones. The camera is great and the battery life is actually better than that of the iPhone.",2014年11月2日 在美国审核
+ ½ *: Great Windows 8.1 Phone,"This was selected as a replacement for my daughter's Samsung Focus i917 Windows 7.1 phone. We were originally going to hold off getting her a phone but decided to let her have one when she started middle school.Just unboxing and setting it up, I could tell the BLU is a significantly better phone than the i917. For one, it comes with a cover and screen protector. While in and of itself not a big deal, this shows that BLU pays attention to the details. The dual Sim slots are another nice feature although we have not used it. I did install a microSD card and appreciate the expanded storage.Finding and loading Windows phone apps has not been as difficult as some have made it out to be. For one, we do not want her to load it up with games, so the main titles that are available have been more than sufficient. Hard core phone gamers will want to consider whether the titles they are interested in are represented. Xbox owners will be better suited for this environment than other game system owners.We also bought her a new laptop running Windows 8. It has very good integration with the BLU phone. As she gets more familiar with the phone and computer, I can see her entering quick notes or thoughts into the phone and transferring the data to her computer. One point about Windows Phone Cortana, it does not allow access to anyone under 13 years old, so she still has a few years to go.As far as the hardware, the phone feels nice and solid but not too heavy. We like the large display and the buttons are responsive. Sometimes, however, the touchscreen seems to require a few attempts before responding. It's difficult to determine if it is the hardware or software. The sound is good, although my daughter says it is almost too loud and there is not enough resolution at the lower range. Calls are clear and we have not had any reception issues.",2014年11月29日 在美国审核

i wouldn't recommend buying any blu phones,"Blu being a new phone company should really pay attention to their customer service.Very dissapointing, i wouldn't recommend buying any blu phones.Stick to brand name who really want to earn your trust for repeat business.After emailing back and forth for weeks, finally got an rma from M.W. (their lead RMA personnel) for my phone to be fixed.Sent my phone in to Miami at my cost ($8 w/signature).2 weeks later, got a courtesy generated email saying that phone issue was just recorded not fixed, factory new replacement sent.However, when i received and opened the package, phone is my old same phone.There's a distict stucked pixel in middle left plrtion of screen during boot up.It's still there.Even the serial number is the same as the one i sent out.Moreover, there are 2 dark scuff marks at top corners.Problem was still there, not fixed.So i spent $8 to have it shipped to blu hq in miami, without a phone for 3.5 weeks, only to havephone returned to me in a more messed up state.I wrote MW back, explained, and sure, i got a nice courteuos apology reply back.MW advised me to resend phone back and there is no other way, nor a guarantee for a new phone.At this point, i really feel grossed out, pardon my feeling, but it's simply the truth, i do not want to get burned twice.There is no attemp on blu to make the situation right to me.I guess i'm not their valued customer.It's just very disturbing and just plain gross how blu treats their customer.Maybe one day, a blu top representative will see this and realize to turn their operation around if they want to earn customer's trust.But in the meantime, at this point, it's a do not buy recommendation.And remember, with a newphone, no matter what or how stable the operating systems are, there's always lots of bugs.And blu doesn't stand behind their products sadly.Good luck if you still plan on purchasing.Yes, it's the included bundled in case, screen protector and lower cost that attracted me in the first place, which at this point, it's not worth it.",2015年3月15日 在美国审核

Actual Device is OK But the Windows OS is Terrible,"If you do not have your heart set on getting a Windows phone as opposed to an iPhone or an Android phone, let me just advise against it. The OS is clunky and there are hardly any apps available. After this test run was over, I passed the Windows phone down to my 7th grade daughter and returned to the iPhone. I have previously used an Android phone so it's not like I'm an Apple snob. But the whole point of getting a smartphone is to have access to the apps and the Windows store has hardly any of the ones I use. Heck, they don't even have something as basic as YouTube!In terms of the actual device itself, it's okay. I'm not enamored of the 5"" size. Yes, the larger screen makes it easier to read compared to the smaller iPhone.

"It has its flaws, but it compensates for them.","Pros:-Huge Screen (could be a con depending on your preferences)-Keyboard is a fully working trackpad. Really helps to navigate around websites and apps-The structure feels very durable and heavy. You can definitely see that it's not cheaply made-Dual speakers. Clarity and volume at the same time.-LED light. I had an iPhone 7, so I wasn't used to having that feature. It's quite useful.-Blackberry HUB. Great idea and seamless integration of content between apps. Essentially a platform that collects and delivers all of the content of your email, social media, phone calls, texts, etc. into one easy swipe. Convenient if you don't like jumping around on all of your different apps and it makes sure you don't miss anything.-Security. In case you didn't know, BB is supposedly known for its high security. Not sure if there really is a difference in security between this phone and any other besides that it's more encrypted (?) I guess. Also, BB has some pre downloaded native apps that help to secure your content.-Battery life. I like it enough. I sometimes forget to charge it and it lasts me all day. It really depends on what your doing and to what extent.- Keyboard. Best thing it has to offer. That's also what BB is known for. I had to get used to the feeling...and after a few uses, I ended up getting annoyed when I had to type on my iPhone or iPad for something. It's just not the same. It's the real deal mayunn. Oh, also, when word suggestions pop up, instead of pressing the word you want... the keyboard has two virtual lines that split it into three columns. If you want to pick a suggestion on the far left side, then you just swipe up on the keyboard on the far left side. Same goes for the middle and right section. I just thought that was pretty advanced stuff for a 2015 phone.-Turn heads. Conversation piece. Ice breaker.""Oh Em G! I thought the BlackBerry was dead!?"" -everyone.Cons:-It's pretty outdated IMO. I've had my fair share of Androids and iPhones. All I can say is that the BB OS is nothing like android. Well, at least the passport. It takes some getting used to. I've had it for almost a week and I'm still learning. Huge learning curve for this one. But...it works. And if it works, then I'm okay with it.-I don't like that it's not compatible with CDMA SIM cards or the Sprint and I believe Verizon carriers. But it works well with GSM SIM cards and I'm using Cricket, which piggybacks off of atnt's network.-It was released in 2015 so the camera quality isn't that great. 13 megapixels...it's just not anything compared to iPhone. If you're planning on taking quality pictures like iPhone, then invest in a camera instead.-It's not user-friendly... at least at first. I was very confused in the beginning. If you're not the type to give things a try, and you like things simple...don't get this phone. It takes some patience. Unless, of course, you're up for the challenge or you're already familiar with BB.-Not many developers and companies support BB anymore. Facebook messenger doesn't work...unless you go on the website.-Apps. This one would be a deal breaker for most. If you're heavily reliant on social media apps...this phone could possibly work for you....or not. You just gotta work your way around the system e.g. native apps, google play, APK (whatever that means), etc. if you still want it... just YouTube or Google stuff for that. For other apps...I guess the native apps work pretty well. You gotta make sure that it's meant for the passport.... since it's a square. It doesn't bother me too much since I'm tryingto detach myself from the social bubble ( I don't need anymore distractions in college). I just need my emails, notifications.. and I'm good.-The placement of the virtual keyboard can be awkward sometimes. Especially since the phone is huge. I don't like that the numbers are virtual and the virtual number pad is on the left side. I'm right handed and typing with my left hand for numbers is not a good mix. Especially if those numbers are for my pin, card number, password, etc. then I could possibly input it in wrong..since typing virtually is less accurate than on a real keyboard.-Most of the native ""apps"" are literally just like a hyperlink that places you on the website platform instead of the mobile app. I believe there are real apps for passport...you just gotta look hard.That's all I can think of for now..so really, all you gotta do is weigh the pros and cons and see if it fits what you're looking for. I actually did quite a bit of research before I made this purchase ( I'm not rich). I needed to make sure that it was actually worth buying. I checked out articles like crackberry, watched YouTube videos like JanOle (recommend watching if you're interested in BB). It's a good phone and will yield many benefits...just as long as you use it to its fullest potential. Hope this review helped you make a decision (or at least come close to it).P.s This is my first Amazon review. The phone was good and I wanted people to know, so I felt compelled to do so.",2017年7月8日 在美国审核
First smartphone and I'm blown away!,"I've had this phone for just over a month now and I love it.Disclaimer:This review is huge and informative....but huge.I went from a Nokia E71 to this phone so there was a huge size difference but the typing experience on the BlackBerry is actually better.At first it was clumsy (why did they make such a small space bar?) but I have now gotten used to it and I'm actually faster due to the fact that BlackBerry inserts periods, spaces, and capitalizes for you.So Basically I just pound out a message and don't think about punctuation.In addition, once you get used to the predictive typing options (just flick your thumb up to choose a word) it gets even faster.It has actually learned a few of the words I use more often, and when it isn't learning fast enough (I'm in the military and use far to many acronyms) they have the option to manually add words/acronyms/whatever.If I'm in an area that has 4G (maybe 30% of the time I use the phone) I can just say whatever I want to the BlackBerry Assistant and the servers at BlackBerry are able to figure out what I'm saying 99% of the time.Pretty cool feature......not used much.Although, when I first got the phone (my first smartphone) I didn't understand how to operate anything in it and would tell it what I wanted constantly, and it figured it out.The keyboard:great except for the small space bar.Bonus: the key material itself is like a laptop touchpad.Same material or something?I don't know but it makes correcting typing much easier!It is also AWESOME to scroll with.I don't even touch the screen.The main reason I bought this phone was because I wanted a physical keyboard and I like to read a ton of news/information.This phone is wonderful for those purposes.One of my favorites is the ""Reader"" options on websites.I cannot stress enough how wonderful this option of the native browser is.You know how you bring up news stories/reviews/virtually anything on the internet and it is full of ads?As soon as the page starts loading just pressthe""R"" button and BlackBerry's browser sifts through it in about 2 seconds and provides you the ACTUAL story (no ads, it has never screwed up this, not once) and any relevant pictures.The web browsing is good on just about every site I have been to, super fast, true to the website, and if I run into compatibility problems I just tell the BlackBerry browser to run the site as a computer (Full Site).I don't know if this is common to all phones nowadays, but it truly displays the site as if you were on a desktop.And that's perfectly okay due to the screen size/readability!Apps. I read that they were a problem with BlackBerry's (I hadn't even had an app before so whatever).I quickly learned how helpful, and unhelpful, apps can be.The Passport has Blackberry World as well as the Amazon App Store installed from the factory.The Blackberry store has a decent mix of apps.The Amazon store has a lot more though.I also side-loaded ""SNAP"" so I have access to the Google Play store.Google Play has a ton of apps, some of them useful, some of them just want your information.The main thing that matters to me is that the Passport allows you to control what information you share in apps.It is the only phone/company that does this.This is HUGE!Any apps you download from Blackberry can be totally controlled by you.From the other two.....not so much.Accept all terms and conditions or else.The funny thing is that some of the most popular apps do exist in Blackberry World, but the same app downloaded in another app store will not have the ability to control them and the information they steal from you.I am a working professional and still attend classes.I was hoping to use this phone while I have downtime to get some school work done online.This can't happen because my school uses Flash for their online textbook (I never knew this before).The Passport DOES have Flash, but it is an older version that doesn't work with my school's textbook.I have read that that it is not Blackberry's fault, Adobe quit updating their mobile software, or whatever, after a certain point.But Blackberry is not alone!Apple doesn't like Flash either.And it seems the industry is moving towards HTML 5......which the Passport DOES support.So that's great for the future.But for now.......no convenient school :(It is compatible with all Microsoft Office programs though.The software that comes with it is pretty good.Especially for Excel.I have yet to find a Word program that can truthfully display a computer screen onto the phone in true proportions.........but this screen comes very close.I'd say 4/5 of the time it's true to the computer screen for Word.It's only in titles and other crazy large print that it doesn't know what to do with it.Size?The size is fine.I held my own US Passport up to it and it matches almost exactly.It's also pretty thin.So I don't have any size complaints.I'm 5'10, 190lbs, and I wear normal jeans.Nothing tight or loose.....just normal people clothes.You can see it in my left pocket but it's not annoying, nobody cares, doesn't get in my way.Cons:Out of date Adobe Flash with no hope for upgrade, Drudge Report app won't work.......but doesn't matter because I just go to the Drudge Report website. I have a hot button for it.No biggie.Anything else, just ask me!",2015年1月19日 在美国审核
would give more stars if I could,"Simply put this phone rocks. Now I am a long time BlackBerry user and have seen most ups and downs as far as phones go. So far I haven't found a thing this phone doesn't do well. I'm not a big gamer, but it has done very well with all I play and on OS 10.3 I haven't found an android game that didn't work, I'm sure there are some but again I'm not a hardcore gamer. I don't do social media - at all, so no review from me there. But messaging, emails, attachments, and pics it is stellar. The editing of documents and pics and videos is outstanding. This is a powerful communication tool and if you use your phone for real work then this will top the list. There are so many things to see and do on this phone I can't possibly list them all without turning this into a review.If your a gamer, you probably want an I-6 or Galaxy. If your phone is an important work device then nothing I've seen comes close.I used to carry a tablet or laptop with me daily to do certain things on the road. With this phone and the new BlackBerry blend I have no reason to carry either one any longer.The sad part is the lack of US support for BlackBerry will blind so many people and they will continue buying products that claim to do these things well, and security is second to none in comparison to Ios or Android OS.",2014年11月5日 在美国审核
"Powerful specs, innovative features, and truly unique!","I don't think I can add much more to some of the more in-depth comments, but I can say that I really like this phone.Its one of the most unique phones on the market and the keyboard is very innovative.Double tap on the keyboard and you basically get a trackpad within the keyboard.Also, the keyboard allows swiping to delete (left) or to swipe word suggestions (swipe up under suggestion).I will say that swiping words is a bit tricky as it sometimes engages the shift key or the number key.As with BlackBerry keyboards, the keys are a pleasure to use and aren't prone to typos like so many crappy virtual keyboards out there.As for apps, between blackberry world, amazon app store, and snap, I pretty much have every android app I could ever want.And I haven't run into a major compatibility issue yet.So, at this point, between bbw, amazon, and snap, BB10 OS has access to just about everything in the android universe.So if you like the BlackBerry user interface (which I think is second to none) and you want a quality phone that is powerful and innovative and productivity-centric, then this phone is for you.Note to newbies, look up how to side-load snap so that you can access what BBW and Amazon App Store cannot.Basically, you side load snap, and then you have yet another app on your phone to increase your accessibility to the android app universe.There may be an app you cannot find in BBW, Amazon or Snap, but I haven't found it yet.So if the only reason you haven't bought a BB is because of lack of apps, that is no longer true in the latest release of BB10 and hasn't been true for at least the past several months.A bit late for BB, I wish they had done this years ago, but facilitating accessibility to the entire android app library, has really made these phones competitive again.",2015年8月17日 在美国审核
The King Of Productivity aka Touch Your Screen Less,"UPDATE after owning the phone for about two weeks. Best phone I've ever owned!The fact that you can watch a youtube video - receive a text message - reply from the message preview - still use the amazing flick option to complete words by swiping up on a physical keyboard that is now lit up because you have touched it - see both the message and the video WHILE it stays in full screen but darkened AND the sound continues to play in HD quality - is simply mind blowing! How many phones and apps would one need to combine to get this experience on a different platform?Here is my review of this device, in sections.THE KEYBOARD:I have medium to large hands so the phone fits perfectly. Yes, it's wider than my Z30, HTC M8 or iPhone was, but it still feels somehow natural. Typing on the physical keyboard is so refreshing and has this solid feel to it. I still type with the same speed but I definitely don't make as many mistakes. Not that it matters because the auto correct catches them very nicely, but still...Overall, I am more precise on this keyboard and that's a good thing. If you send a bunch of texts, emails or post Craigslist ads, Passport is it. I would now find it weird going back to a touch keyboard actually.There is so many things to love about this phone's keyboard. Because I can use the keyboard as a track pad, I have enabled the option where the ENTER button sends the message. This means that I barely have to touch the screen when sending text messages. I just type something up, hit the enter button and out it goes. If I make a mistake, I can just double tap the keyboard to bring up the edit option and when the cursor is in place, I can just start typing what I want. When I am done, I press enter to send; and again, I haven't touched the screen accept for launching the app. If you have an ongoing conversation going on via text or email, this is going to be an amazing experience.I can also double tap the space bar at the end of the sentence for a period. And / or I can swipe down on the keyboard to bring up the numbers and symbols. So if I would want to write a number 1 for example, I just swipe down and hit W, as that letter is assigned to that number. To capitalize a letter at the beginning of the sentence, or write in CAPS anywhere for that matter, I just hold down the letter button a bit longer. No need for a shift key when it comes to this. Deleting a word? Swipe from right to the left on the keyboard to delete full words.Do you post a lot of ads? The keyboard will remember the words AND the order of words you write your text in and next time you can just keep swiping up on the keys as the phone suggests those words, in the order you have used them before. No need to retype anything. Brilliant! The touch keyboard is great. It takes getting used but it is very workable. The only thing I don't like is the weird positioning of the number 0 as it as oddly on the left, right next to the number 1. Any other keyboard has it under the number 8. The keys are lit up and they dim automatically.Lastly, the Passport has received a major software update on February 19th 2015. One of the features added are keyboard shortcuts. What this means, and again this is in the category of things that will blow your mind, is that you can now link features and apps to a specific key. For instance you can not only set a key to open your text messages, but you can literally open it to where you are composing a brand new message. Want to lock the phone with a different key? You can. Want to lunch navigation or a game by holding down a different button? You can. To sum up the keyboard, it is revolutionary and amazing.What the first iPhone did in 2008 with a full touch screen, BlackBerry Passport is doing with it's keyboard since 2014! There isn'ta phone in the world that can do what the Passport does.SCREEN:The screen is great. Very vivid, clear and with no visible pixels. And unlike other phones (as far as I know), I can chose the color saturation and the white balance. So if I want, I can make it over-saturated Iike a Samsung or an iPhone device. A cool feature haha.The screen of this device now feels just as standard to me as a 16:9 screen would feel two weeks a go. I really like it. If you are afraid of the display, don't be. You get used to seeing more on the screen very easily :-)Now, I usually watch videos on youtube when in bed, which means in low light to very dark light conditions. Not having to turn the phone to get a 16:9 ratio is actually a good thing. A larger would mean more video on a screen which means more light to strain my eyes. I actually found my self watching videos in portrait mode on my Z30 anyway, so the Passport's square screen works perfect for me.Videos will play in every angle except when the phone is upside-down, so that should give everyone enough flexibility, depending on what side is the charging cable plugged in from, or what suits your comfort.BATTERY:The battery life is outstanding. There is no other phone in the world right now that would allow you to have such a great battery life with a constant screen time on. Literally, if you are writing documents, emails, watching videos, movies or reading books, there isn't a cell phone that will last you longer. Keep this in mind. The Note4 might be the closest but it has a larger screen and a smaller battery so you do the math. Going by experience, I'd say that the Note4 would hold a candle to the Passport.SPEAKERS:The sound is great! My z30 shamefully beat my HTC One M8 when it comes to sound quality. The Passport is just as good if not better. Amazing speaker sound, really amazing.CELL:The cell service quality is in a league of it's own. The only company that can even say ""HI"" to a BlackBerry device when it comes to call quality and signal strength is maybe, maybe an older Nokia or Motorola. My iPhones always had two bars less in the same environment and with the same provider. HTC might have the same signal strength but definitely not the same call quality. So really, I don't know who to compare it to.OS:The BlackBerry 10.3 operating system is again in a league of it's own. Android, before the release of Lollipop, was not even a competition. It was just too unpolished, unfinished and the radio bug was something that I could not accept! iOS on the other hand was more polished but very limited in general. BlackBerry OS is both polished a very refined with the feeling of security on top, and provides more then enough flexibility to not have a limited user experience?Of course, everyone who tries the HUB loves it and it's hard to go back to any other OS just because of that. But there is a lot of other things that make the OS stand out. Saving a picture or a contact is definitely the easiest of any platform. Also, sharing a file and having the OS provide you with the most commonly used app AND the person you share with the most,is one of those features that makes this OS so unique. The update that came out on the 19th of February allows you to block contacts and the list goes on. I have tried all major OS, Windows, Android, iOS and this is by far, and very easily, the number one mobile OS currently available.I have a 2015 Subaru Legacy and pairing the device with my stereo through BT was a breeze. I know that when iOS8 came out, I lost some features such as switching songs via my steering wheel. Everything works fine when it comes to this.APPS:Ironically, BlackBerry might be leading in the application section, as it draws apps from at least 3 different places. BlackBerry World, Amazon appstore that now comes standard, and Snap which can be downloaded on the side. Considering the scenario 2 years back when everyone was screaming and shouting at BlackBerry for this, look what they have done for their customers? It is very close to the Apples app store.CAMERA:Ok, there is no doubt that iPhones lead in the camera department. They just have amazing cameras. Is the camera of the Passport better? Probably not, but it's very close! Especially in the video quality. It's crystal clear. This is definitely the best camera BlackBerry has ever put in a device. Both on paper and in real life. I took some amazing pictures and shot some amazing 60fps videos. Everyone will be satisfied with the camera! It's def above average and more then enough for everyday use. Finally! I am happy that this device has this improvement.SUMMARY:A combination of certain hardware specs such as a LED front notification light, a square screen, a physical keyboard, the high end feel, great cell signal, a great camera and an amazing battery, make this phone unique for me. That's my Passport. It's an amazing package overall. I would spend my money on this phone all over again, over any iPhone or main stream Samsung device, any day.Is BlackBerry Passport the best BlackBerry ever made? Honestly, I don't know. I haven't use them all. BUT: I have learned with the BlackBerry Z30 which I have purchased on a black Friday deal for $230, that you don't have to go with the masses to get the ""best device"" out there. Guess what. My Z30 became the best all touch cell phone I have ever used! Not my HTC, Samsung, iPhone, Nokia, LG or Alcatel! Most of which were double or triple in price!The Passport is the best phone I have ever used with a physical keyboard &amp; I've been around cell phones for 15 years now. That's for sure.Even BlackBerry claims that they have not made a phone with hardware specs such as these, so it's a great feeling owning a top of the line BlackBerry product. AND it is still cheaper than those mainstream rivals.It's all here:Reliability, safety, productivity, fun, luxury, build quality, speed, battery life and great OS.If you are looking for a device with a physical keyboard (and if you don't know whether you are or not, please try a BlackBerry phone in any store that carries it and you'll get your answer), look no further. Please do buy this phone if you are in the market and please use Amazon to purchase it. You get a world class phone and a world class customer service. It hardly gets better...well maybe once the Passport 2 comes out ...but until then, long lived the King of PRODUCTIVITY.",2015年2月17日 在美国审核
I loved the Sony hardware but found android as an os ...,"I had been a BlackBerry die hard for many years, but the failed launch of BB10 and some questionable decisions by the company left me worried. Admittedly after my Z10 proved insufficient in the hardware dept I moved on to other ecosystems. I tried an iPhone briefly and settled on a Sony xperia. I loved the Sony hardware but found android as an os to not give me what I wanted in a communication device. Sure it is great at media and apps but when it came time to seriously use it as a phone I found it lacking. So then the Passport is revealed and it blew my mind from the previews. I ordered one and have been using it now for a few days and let me tell you it is one of the best phones I have evered used. The screen is amazing. It takes a while to get used to just how wide it is. But now that I have I don't think I can ever go back. I use this phone unlocked on US tmobile and I have full functionality. Everything works except wifi calling.",2014年10月18日 在美国审核
Get More Done With the Passport,"I don't normally write reviews for products, but the BlackBerry Passport is the best phone I've ever owned, and I have to tell someone about it. Pardon if this rambles a bit or is not comprehensive for all features - I'm simply describing my own use of the device with a particular focus on how it makes me more productive and organized.I bought the Passport on a whim before New Year's Day looking for something different after having become frustrated with how the iPhone 5s handles e-mail and notifications. As much as I wanted to like the iPhone's sliding tray of notifications for various applications, I never quite got the hang of it - it just wasn't intuitive or efficient. I also found myself frustrated with the lack of a physical keyboard, having owned a BlackBerry 9900. By the way, in case anyone accuses me of being a BlackBerry diehard - prior to THAT BlackBerry, I had the first 3 versions of the iPhone. So you could say I've been back and forth with BlackBerry and Apple.Complicating matters is the fact that I'm an Apple loyalist - I have owned but one PC in my life, the one exception to multiple MacBooks, Powerbooks, and desktop Macs. I've also owned a couple of versions of the iPad, and currently use an iPad 4. Got it? I love Apple products.So why would someone like me not get an iPhone 6, or better yet, the iPhone 6 Plus? I had extensive opportunities to try it out and looked forward to getting one and using it as an eReader thanks to the large screen. It seemed perfect for many reasons. It would be a lot of fun to own.But then, I had an epiphany. I thought about what I actually used my phone for the most, and what I really needed it for. When I did that, the BlackBerry Passport, which I had never seen in person and only read and watched reviews of on the internet, seemed more and more attractive.I realized that what I use my phone most for fit perfectly into the realm of the Passport:- E-mail. I sometimes handle hundreds of e-mails in a given day, Moreover, what I do makes it essential that I'm able to respond to clients and colleagues in quick fashion. The Passport not only has a unified inbox (so does the iPhone nowadays), it pools all of your notifications and priorities into one place via BlackBerry Hub. The Hub is incredible - you can get to it from within any app just by swiping, and ""peek"" at what needs to be done.- Phone. The size of the Passport makes it challenging to use as a phone, but the call quality is excellent, and the speakerphone is without equal. It pairs to multiple bluetooth devices easily. One nice feature is that if you have a Chrysler vehicle, Uconnect works with Blackberry 10 seamlessly to read your text messages aloud as you drive. Cool.- Battery Life. I would often find myself running out of battery life with my iPhone, which is immensely frustrating when you are in the middle of a busy day. Not with the Passport. While some users have reported getting 2 days of use out of their Passport, I've been getting a little less than that, but still respectable - normally 16-17 hours or so with HEAVY use throughout the day. In other words, on a typical day I unplug around 7am, and if I'm still working at 9 or 10pm, I typically still have more than enough juice left to go for a couple hours if need be. Another way to measure that is that by the time my ""regular"" workday ends around 6pm, I usually have close to (or sometimes more than) half the battery life remaining, depending on what I've been doing that day.- Viewing (and editing) Documents. Do you view spreadsheets? Do you read documents? The Passport is wider than even the iPhone 6 Plus, and it makes reading documents unbelievably easy.- Integration. I need Evernote, Twitter, and Facebook integration, and the Passport does it well with the BlackBerry Hub that sends you the exact kinds of notifications you want displayed (or not). ""But there's no Instagram!"" some people might shout. That's true, but there's a great Instagram client app in BlackBerry World called iGrann which works seamlessly and also works well with BlackBerry Hub.- Last but certainly not least, I need a great browser. Web browsing on phones will never be as good as the experience you might get with a larger tablet or a computer, but it shouldn't be a frustrating experience. The BlackBerry 10 Browser is unbelievable, and is undoubtedly better than any browser I've used on any other mobile device. Another feature you won't believe you lived without: because the Passport has 3GB of RAM (that's a lot, folks) the Browser actually caches WHOLE PAGES while you tab over to another site. What that means is that tif you have multiple tabs open, when you go back to the original site, it won't have to completely reload. iPhone users know what I mean when I say that having to reload sites you've already opened is frustrating and sometimes very time consuming. Not on the Passport!What about the ""possible downsides"" of the Passport? They are well documented in other reviews, but I'll just make it short and sweet:- Games... Honestly, if you're a big mobile gamer, don't buy a Passport. I'm sure there are great games available in Blackberry World, and/or Amazon App Store (in fact, I know firsthand that Angry Birds works great on the Passport), but you just won't be able to match the selection you get with the App Store on the iPhone, nor the developer support.- Apps... Everyone says ""BlackBerry doesn't have apps."" It may be true that BlackBerry doesn't have as many apps, but there are plenty to choose from. The revolution really happened whenever BlackBerry opened up BlackBerry 10 OS to Android apps through the Amazon app store and a third party application called Snap, which allows users to download apps from the Google Play store. If you have Snap, you basically have access to everything an Android user has access to. While they are not built for the square screen of the BlackBerry Passport, most Android apps I have found work very well, with few issues. Not all will, however, but most of your apps should work.- No FaceTime... One thing I did use occasionally on my iPhone was FaceTime, and it was a bummer that there's no cross-platform solution that is quite the same for BlackBerry. However, if you use Skype, you can get around this quite easily. Skype works pretty well on BlackBerry 10.- Text Messages on my Mac.... I did like iMessage for Mac, and used it to send text messages. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that BlackBerry has a desktop solution for doing text messages and BBMs (if you use it, which we probably never will in our household), called BlackBerry Blend. Blend is an application that runs on your computer desktop and allows you to use your BlackBerry for text messages and so forth when you authorize it to do so. It pops up notifications on OS X, and works quite well. I've read that it's incredibly secure because unlike iMessage, it's tied completely to the device, basically ""mirroring"" your BlackBerry on the computer. It's a good solution which will probably get better.Since the first things I mentioned are the features I realized consumed probably 96-97% of my iPhone 5s usage, switching back to BlackBerry was not only easy - it was a no brainer, at least, if the phone delivered as promised (remember, I had never even seen one in person!).Thankfully, when I received the device, my fears that this was a stupid experiment doomed to failure were allayed. This is an excellent phone that feels good in the hands, although even with my big hands, it's primarily a two-handed device. I was surprised at how nice the screen was, and how easy the keyboard was to use after about a day of getting used to it. It's well made, and feels solidly made, as you would expect from BlackBerry. The camera is actually very good as long as it gets a chance to focus, which can take a couple of seconds.Over three weeks later, I think it's a keeper. I've been able to blaze through my never-ending stream of e-mails and organize my busy life with ease with the BlackBerry Passport. I have not once run out of battery during the day! Wow!While it's not a phone for everyone, if you use your phone to be productive throughout the day and night, you really can't go wrong giving the Passport a try. Most likely, as I did, you'll love it.",2015年1月25日 在美国审核
Blackberry took a chance and got it right!,"This is by far the best Blackberry phone I’ve owned!Having owned a Curve, Bold, and Q10…the Passport is easily the best phone that Blackberry has developed.For me, there are 4 reasons for this opinion: screen size, processing power, battery life, and OS 10.3.Screen size and resolution is outstanding!It is now possible to easily and comfortably browse the Internet and perform tasks that were previously best suited for a tablet or larger system.Image size and quality make use of the phone much more comfortable and enjoyable.The phone is fast thanks to its quad core processor and 3GB of RAM.Processing power is outstanding for all functions…the phone flies through swipes and clicks.And the browser is fast!Any lag will be due to a slowly responding Internet server, slow Internet connection speed (Wi-Fi) or cellular network…not the phone.The 3450mAH battery provides exceptional staying power with charging every other day on average with my use.Another advantage is that I now leave Wi-Fi on all the time…something I didn’t do with my previous phones due to battery drain.Lastly, OS 10.3…this is an outstanding operating system and one that is an obvious improvement to 10.2 on the Q10.The OS is easy to use, well organized, and packed with features that I’m still discovering.",2014年12月2日 在美国审核
"bought it for work, ended up falling in love","To address the elephant in the room first, yes. BlackBerry is still alive.I had my doubts about this phone. I owned a blackberry Z10 a few years back which I absolutely hated. I got it because I'm a software developer and they gave it to me for free to make apps on. The phone and operating system felt sluggish and unfinished. It looked great but felt painful to use as an actual phone. So naturallyI was a bit skeptical about this new Passport. Even though it looked beautiful, I was worried that it'd be a repeat of the Z10. Regardless, I bought it anyways because I needed a recent blackberry for my development work.Long story short, I fell in love. The past two years have seen enormous improvements to the BlackBerry 10 operating system, making it more than simply ""usable"". I could go on about how awesome this system is for hours, but there are already tons of reviews out there.This thing can run Android apps, and the super sleek BlackBerry native apps. The Z10 could do it too, but it was a very underpowered phone with low end specs, so it really struggled and lagged running Android apps. The Passport is a super powered high-end flagship that can rival the current top android phones in hardware specs, and absolutely blows them out of the water in build quality and design. It has a very nice weight to it and is very sturdy. It does not creak or bend like other phones, and the keyboard's quality is amazing.Truthfully it does take a bit of getting used to. I hadn't used a few physical keyboard on a phone in many years, and I've never used one as oddly shaped as this. So to say it was awkward at first is an understatement. Still, after using it for a week I just can't find it in me to go back to my LG G3. I love this thing. You haven't scrolled until you've scrolled by swiping your finger across the Passport keyboard in horizontal orientation.It definitely isn't perfect though. I was able to install the Google Play store on it very easily, so I got access to all my Android apps and my Play Music subscription, but that highlights one of the issues with this phone. There isn't a huge selection of native blackberry apps, so a lot of times you'll be finding yourself using Android apps instead. Android apps work perfectly fine on this device (except for a bit of awkwardness in the notifications), but native BlackBerry apps are definitely better. Until more people adopt blackberry 10, developers are not going to create many more native apps for the platform.",2015年2月18日 在美国审核
3) It doesn't sit in your hand like a traditional BB keyboard,"I was a Crackberry addict before, then switched to Samsung S4.Now back to the addiction with a Passport.Overall experience the same, but some issues:1)No java script on emails.So many pictures on your email don't get shown2)Android emulator doesn't necessary mean you can use all the Android apps.Many of the apps don't fit the screen and buttons are not activated.For example, Shazam or Spodify.3)It doesn't sit in your hand like a traditional BB keyboard.Buttons are lower so your thumbs are a little awkwardly limited.4)For some this size is too big.5)Accessories are limited at stores.So things like jackets or sleeves you will have to buy off the internet without being able to touch/feel the product.6)The main Hub which consolidates your email, msgs, txts, whatsapp, etc doesn't upload/download real time and in seconds.You can change the settings, but sometimes it may sit for a few minutes without refreshing.Not a long time.Overall, I'm happy with it and won't change to Samsung.But I think there is a lot of room for improvement",2014年12月3日 在美国审核
Univeral Search fixed in latest OS releases :-) :-) :-),"UPDATE: Yay! My favorite feature is fixed in the latest (unofficial) operating system releases. Should eventually be in an official over the air upgrade. See comments for more info.~~Old title: Fantastic device unless you are addicted to 10.2.1's universal search bar.This is a fantastic device; however for just one idiosyncratic reason I'm returning it - and it's something that may be changed in a future 10.3.x OS release - not hardware related. In 10.2.1, you could quickly swipe up from anywhere and then type; what you typed would then go into a universal search bar, from which point you could easily touch an icon of an installed app to do something with that text - create a new note, email yourself, search for apps, search google, etc. Now for some reason that defies explanation instead of starting a new ""search"", it appends the text you type to the old one. So you either have to back-swipe as many times as there are words, or hit a small ""x"" icon in the topmost right corner, which given the size and weight distribution of the device is about the most annoying thing to have to do; there is no way you can do it without shifting your hands around a lot. This may seem like a small issue, but the whole point of the universal search bar is to be able to do things quickly. So Q10 + 10.2.1 for me until this gets fixed...",2014年11月25日 在美国审核
Best phone on the market today!,"Received my new Blackberry Passport yesterday after waiting for it for almost three weeks. To be absolutely honest I was not sure if I was going to like it.

"First BlackBerry, completely blown away","This is the first time I have EVER purchased a BlackBerry device and was previously using an LG G3 and an iPhone 6+ (I test applications on multiple devices to ensure consistent experiences)The BlackBerry Passport is my new daily driver and is absolutely my favorite phone of all time.First of all the keyboard makes typing not faster but significantly more accurate, and because the keyboard is touch sensitive once you learn about swiping you can type faster then a touch keyboard while still maintaining super high accuracy without autocorrect getting in the way.The battery is exceptionally good. As an entrepreneur my phone needs to be reliably working around the clock. I can EASILY over a day and a half with moderate to heavy use, and while traveling/weekends easily 2-3 days. It just keeps going and going and I almost never desperately hunt for a charger any more.Apps and Software: With the Amazon App store I am able to get all of the programs I need (banking apps, credit card apps, airlines ect). I prefer getting apps from the BlackBerry world as they seem to run much faster with better options. I noticed however Android apps from the Amazon App store run fairly well most of the time and even games such as clash of clans run very smoothly. You are able to install apps from the Google Play store, however it takes about 30 minutes worth of tinkering to set up, so I decided since I have all the apps I need, I didn't need to proceed.The browser is fantastic, super fast, and desktop websites look perfectOffice to Go is built in, but frankly I don't like it as much as Microsoft Office. So I downloaded the Microsoft Office APK from the web and sure enough the android app works fine for meThe operating system itself is extremely fast, fluid and easy to use with tons of gestures and secrets that even with several months of use I still learn new things. That said this phone isn't for everyone, those who watch tons of videos and games likely will benefit from a different phone. But for consistency, reliability, speed, battery life, and getting work done, I have yet to find a better phone",2015年3月15日 在美国审核
best new blackberry made,"I purchased this passport a week ago and I'm not disappointed. Having previously owned the z10 I am already familiar with the latest BlackBerry 10 OS so the change was without issue. The specs for this phone don't do it justice as actually holding the product when you get it make you realize how big it really is, however it is not hard to hold single handed and fits in your pocket nicely. One of the first noticed improvements over the Z10 is the speed especially to boot up after a full shut down. Second would be the battery although it isn't user removable it lasts at least a full 24 hours with moderate use. Third would be the QWERTY keyboard that BlackBerry user have come to love with legacy devices and the Q10 and classic. A special feature of the new keyboard is that it is touch sensitive and you can use it to scroll through Web pages instead of swiping the screen. Also as you type if you need numbers or symbols that is brought up on the onscreen keyboard. The size of the screen makes viewing pictures and video really enjoyable with excellent picture quality. The camera can be a little slow but works excellent and the led flash doubles as a flashlight. One of my issues though is the fact that some of the apps from blackberry world haven't been updated to support the passport so they are unavailable to install but it comes preloaded with amazon appstore and if you do some research you can access google play store as well. So with that being said my only other issue is that the battery isn't user replaceable but that seems to be the norm now a days. Based on my experience I recommend this phone to current and new BlackBerry users out there, hope this review is helpful.",2015年2月18日 在美国审核
Great Device - Worth Consideration  (I switched from an iPhone 5),"I've had the BBPP 4 days now and I'm enjoying it a great deal.I love the BB Hub and it's functionality was more that I expected.I've had all of the platforms and outside of the availability of apps, like the BB the most.And really, BB phones are just as good if not better than other platforms. If they would have invested in the apps/developers they would still have a strong market share.I switched from an iPhone 5.The battery was terrible and did freeze up and for some reason some type of data was taking up space.It was misc data and even the iStore couldn't help, except to swipe it and restore.But the real reason for the switch is that I wanted a phone that would work, like last all day with use and clear phone calls (although most of my communication is through text and emails - which the actual keyboard is a big help).The keyboard is fantastic along with the suggested text.The screen is huge and like advertised, makes reading emails and websites easy/more pleasant.As you may have read in other reviews, it does take a couple of days to get used to the size.The OS is intuitive and easy to learn.Pros:* Long Battery Life* Great Display* Hub* Phone Quality* Can run Amazon Apps in addition to the BB WorldCons:* App Availability (but we all knew that)* Not available in retail storesLike any phone and OS, it is dependent on the user and this phone will not be for everybody (like advertised).BB has reset itself and have come out with a great quality phone.I would definitely recommend it.",2014年12月8日 在美国审核
My seventh BlackBerry,"Started with Curve, two Bolds, including that sweet 9930. Got the Playbook, thankfully when it was $199. Did the Z10 early adoption and scored the Z30 Black Friday deal. Rest of my computer/mobile tech is Apple. Have always had a sweet spot for RIM, now just called BlackBerry.The keyboard as trackpad is fantastic for reading emails and browser pages. Pop into reader mode by pressing R and away you go.Keyboard is sweet, nice and large. We've passed the days of one hand operation on smartphones. This Passport makes the most of it.While it's wide, it's now ungainly. It's shorter than my Z30, perfectly pocketable, just like your paper passport. The I-beam structure is not iPhone bendy. This feels like a solid 2-3 year phone, just like my Bold 9930 was.This does what mobile phones are supposed to, crystal clear calls, quick text communication and some extras added in. Looking forward to using Evernote for my final grad school year next year. After just getting this phone a day ago and knowing the BlackBerry 10 ecosystem, I'm going to be able to leave my laptop at home and just take my Passport to class and out and about for mobile computing needs.If you want to get things done from productivity side of things while on the go, look no further. If you're baked into the iOS or Google ecosystem, it might be a little hard to switch. Blackberry Link brings my iTunes library over. And heck, 64 GB cards are only $25 now. You don't have the hard drive markup issue here.For those BlackBerry refugees who left 2-4 years ago, this Passport is the flagship you've been looking for.I put my money where my mouth is and bought another BlackBerry.

Lives up to the hype,"I went from Blackberries back around the late 2000's and early 2010's, to iPhones and Androids and Windows phones, and am stoked to come back to Blackberry again. This thing is built like a rock and performs like one. It runs faster than Usain Bolt and lasts longer than Sting. I have several Android apps running (Wechat is a battery hog) along with Blackberry stuff like Hub and calendar, and the battery gets me through an entire day of heavy usage with room to spare. Like my Blackberries from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, this beast moves along without fail. Blackberries were the most reliable phones I've ever used and I'm feeling the streak will continue with this Passport.The Hub and BB10 gestures take a little getting used to, but once you get the gist of it you will get sh*t done like there's no tomorrow. The square display also takes a little getting used to but it really is great when going through Excel files and browsing web pages.I get quite a few stares and snickers when I whip out this block of a dinosaur but hey, suck on my giant trackpad and keyboard shortcuts!",2015年11月3日 在美国审核

Some say that had a time getting the hang of it. its a little different, but in one day im already typing faster and less mistakes on this device than from the Z10.. and those who dont know, you get the Blackberry secure apps from Blackberry App world., but you can also load Android apps on this device. from Amazon App store which comes pre loaded or you can get it from other sources. so plenty of apps!! This device feels solid! looks solid and not cheap at all. I highly recommend to anyone who is a blackberry fan, or bored with the same old Android, iPhone experience. try something new! Its very productive, great display, lots of Ram (3G)and memory (32). 2.2Ghz quad core processing , heck this is a PC in your hand!! oh also!! Blackberry Blend! look into it . Im on my PC but i can check my passport calendar, Texts , emails, calls, BBM etc..from my PCor Tablet!",2014年12月4日 在美国审核
The Boss!!,"When I first unboxed it my first reaction was ""wow!"" (the build quality is stunning) followed by ""how am I going to live with it?! it's huge"". After just one days use i picked up my old phone and couldn't believe how restricted the screen felt so living with the extra width of the passport is definitely worth it!I never thought I'd return to a physical keyboard again but I'm loving it now.Before buying one i did read somewhere online that one reviewer found it hard to hold and found it unbalanced and heavy and that almost stopped me. I'm pleased to report that I find it well balanced and the extra weight hasn't bothered me at all in my jacket or hands.you really need to give it about a week before you can get everything done lightening fast on this device.You can not beat the os (QNX based), and if you really need to get things done the ""hub"" (universal inbox) is a must , i mean how stupid and old-fashioned is it to have to open a email app and a text app and a bbm app and a whatsapp app etc when with bb10 these things ""plug "" into the os and hub and you never miss a thing. Once you start using a passport it becomes obvious to you when your trying to get messages to a non bb10 user-they ain't checking all apps and some messaged are going unnoticed by them.(no, grouped notifications are not the same thing, you have to use the hub to understand).If you want to buy music it's best to download 7digital from BlackBerry world.The best thing about the passport is that I don't need to visit my pc as often as before other than for my photoshop jobs.I was very impressed with amazon's service and delivery time!By far the best phone you can buy.",2014年11月21日 在美国审核
"It is a team that looks pretty good, maybe a little heavy but enough","I have taken some time to write a review but it is the right time, I have it 4 months. It is a team that looks pretty good, maybe a little heavy but enough, is thin, very strong (I have already fallen several times and nothing happened, even a fall from the first floor). it is very very fast. The physical keyboard is very useful for me because again I can type without looking at the keyboard. People stop me to take the phone and watch it and love it, I never felt that with a phone. with respect to the applications you can install the store of google (there is an option explained on page crackberry.com, or if you want you can install snap or use the Amazon store that is preloaded. For me it is a superior phone to all that there is, of course, is a matter of taste, but I have used samsung and iphone, and there is no comparison even resistance, I have seen iphone and samsung break of falls of 50 cm; eye that charge unprotected, just as wine, and so far the screen does not have a scratch. I personally buy the black version and the special red edition for my wife, a team of white for my sister and my son has special version silver. it's a wonderful team. Recommended",2016年8月21日 在美国审核
Dare to be different - I like this phone!,"Never been excited for a phone before but I was pumped to get my hands on the Passport, despite slight ridicule from people...but dare to be different! I was never a fan of iPhones even though my dad has always had one (literally every generation and just got the 6...will play with it when I go home next time). My Torch lasted me 5+ years and I was foremost impressed with how durable BBs are - not as flimsy or delicate as many others. Also I'm not big on games or having 100 different types of social media apps on my phone (no, i'm not 90 years old or live under a rock), so I knew it wouldn't be a problem.After a week using the phone. Here are my two cents.PROS- Crisp, wide screen (was reading some PDFs and it was a breeze)- Touch-enabled physical keyboard (it's like having 2 touch screens, although I do prefer just using the actual one)- Battery life- Ability to multitask...everything at your fingertipsCONS- Dropped it first day b/c of how wide it is...but I'm much more used to it now. I used to be able to hold my phone and a glass/cup/mug at once...now it's more difficult- Can't text on the touch screen...my Torch could...although i didn't use it much, i would've still liked that option.

Awesome phone - Lets set the tone,"Awesome phone - Lets set the tone .... I have used most highend phones manufactured to date which would include all the iphones, Samsung Galaxys and Notes, and even the HTC M8 and M9. I stopped using my iphone and Note 4 after sticking with the Passport ! Yes it took some time getting use to the physical keyboard. Everyone around me thinks I have lost it giving up my Iphone 6 Plus and my Note 4 but they just don't get it! Yes the apps in the store are missing a few good ones but this phone comes with the Amazon Android App Store loaded so you can find a few more decent apps to use but if you are app driven you probably won't be satisified with the availability of apps for this phone. On the otherhand if you use it for business and need to communicate via the phone and email features you will love this phone period. When this phone first came out I bought one but ended up sending it back but afterwards I got another one and stuck with it for about a week and now you couldn't pry it out of my hand if I was dead!

"Most Likely the Best of the Last, The Real Truth about this Smartphone! Yes' the Battery Lasts for for Days without Google Play","Actually the best Phone I could find available to rid myself of Google. My last phone was a Samsung Note 2 which is an excellent phone as well that became almost a dumb phone if you don't agree to Googles Policy of surrendering your rights Google Services and Google Play, so they can track and make money on you against your will! ""Watch out don't update"", don't update your phones! In the past good apps work great then they become useless, slow, phones slow down and burn-out being laced with spyware and trackers, just like Microsoft Windows Updates on your computers Laced at home! Read the Internet reviews and check every update before updating wait a while before jumping!My Incredible 2 phone was great for 2 years before they gave it a automatic update and ruined it on me, just like my phone before!This BlackBerry Passport is unlocked and does not come with Service Provider's Crapware,Slowdown, Google,Google Services,Google Play, Microsoft laced spyware! Don't Update set it not to update automatically or it will become like any other android, linux(Microsoft), Apple and you can loose all your privacy while they make money on you! Take a bite out of legalized crime, don't give in and buy this before their gone!Palm was sold out, Blackberry was sold out, Beos was sold out, lycoris, linux and more sold out to Microsoft and Google.I miss having a home wired phone, phone boothes and Giant Companies not allowed to become inhuman money monopolies!After researching, they have pulled/burried most information and books on this smartphone because it really is that good, check and read peoples reviews not paid wolf's! Get it if you want a great phone that really is a smartphone and not a android linux know your business and make money on you slave type tool! So nice not to see Google and Microsoft put on this phone, just watchout for your service provider putting them and their own crap on it, set it not to update as soon as you set it up because they will and your privacy will be gone and sold like most everyones!Side load apps after checking them out by the majority of people, by the way this phone will allow you to download multitudes of apps for blackberry, you have to find them before they get burried because Google Android and Google Play are here and BlackBerry went for them$$$!",2017年2月25日 在美国审核
Wow!!!!,"The first Passport I got from Amazon was a flop. The battery got hot.The WI-FI reception was poor. The Network signal reception was poor. Things just didn't feel right. In other words it just didn't feel like a BlackBerry. I requested a return the next day - a Tuesday. I got a replacement the next day, on Wednesday! (I'm a Prime customer). The replacement is everything the first one wasn't. Wow! No hot battery. Great WI-FI reception. Five bar network reception. I guess every once in a while a lemon comes along and I'd have to say the first was a lemon. The replacement is five stars all the way! Great battery life, pictures, network signal (I got the T-Mobile SIM package included). The only thing that users should be aware of is that you won't be able to activate your Passport from the Passport itself. You have to go to the T-Mobile website, www.T-Mobile.com/Activation, to activate the SIM card. If you do your own activation, you can select the $30/5GM/100minutes Plan. I added the Hotspot for an additional $15. Not a bad deal although in other countries (Canada, Bahamas) you get at least one hotspot for free.",2015年3月10日 在美国审核
What I would call the first true mobile computing device - pushing the boundries,"People that have never used this phone will never understand it. On paper it makes no sense, the weight, dimensions, screen size and features leave the average consumer baffled when reading a specs sheet or review. In a market saturated by a form factor developed over 7 years ago, it is difficult to understand that perhaps what is normal is not what is best. Just looking at this phone it is easy to see that Blackberry went back to the drawing board and tried to re-imagine the mobile computing experience in order to maximize efficiency and utility on a pocket sized device. Once you've used the screen for a few hours, you will understand exactly why its square. Everything looks better and less misshapen when compared to the typical screen dimensions of a rectangle. I probably read close on a hundred articles a day on varying sites, many which are not optimized for mobile browsing, this screen, combined with Blackberry's reader mode allows me to effortlessly adjust all text and images so that they format properly instantly.The size is easy to get used to, and it fits in any of my pant pockets. Battery life is another huge feature, I can easily last 24 hours without needing to recharge. I am very glad Blackberry didn't follow the usual trend and sacrifice battery capacity for weight reduction, something which Apple is notorious for doing. The weight of a phone means nothing and is barely noticeable, where as poor battery life is easily the most frustrating things a that can cripple a good phone.The operating system itself has finally matured to a point where there are no major features an Apple of Android can do that a BB10 phone cannot. In fact many features that are built into the OS require third party apps on other platforms. To me the biggest feature of the BB10 OS is the swipe navigation, which is hard to appreciate until you've used the phone for a few days and then try and go back to another platform. Swiping makes everything so much more effortless and smooth as opposed to hitting a home button. Moving from app to app is very fast , and the fact that app stay running as opposed to being paused like on other platforms is a massive feature to me, as I am someone who likes to do multiple things at once.The keyboard is as smooth as butter and there is nothing more satisfying as tactile feedback, which is far more accurate for most people, even if glass typing is probably slightly faster. The lack of errors and not having to use Apples auto correct more than makes up for it though. I find myself using the capacitive feature of the keyboard much more often than I thought I would, its incredible for text selection and to scroll through web pages. Text selection needs to be mentioned again because its just that incredible.The build quality is excellent, this phone could most likely be used as a weapon if need be. The solid metal outside is not only premium feeling, but for me negates the need for a case. I really don't think this thing will be breaking any time soon from a drop.The addition of Blackberry Blend is massive. Even now, in its infancy with basic features, Blend is getting a lot of use on my desktop. I love not being tied to a phone and having the ability to message while my phone charges on the other side of the room. Its now easier than ever to get and send files to my device which is huge for me. I truly think that down the road if Blend gets a browser, word processor and the ability to take calls, it might even replace the desktop for most casual users. Really excited to see where Blackberry goes with it.Finally, it just feels great to pull out a phone and have everyone staring at it and asking to see it. This phone is like how I remember the first Iphone. Everyone wants to hold it and 90% of comments are positive and with genuine interest. Even people who know nothing about phones and simply buy whatever the person in the store tells them are amazed by this phone, because it really is something out of the ordinary. Women especially take a liking to it, and typically they aren't that enthused by gadgets. Even the latest Iphone 6 won't get a second glance from most people because its become so common and run of the mill. That fact alone is very positive for Blackberry and I can't wait to see where they go from here.",2014年12月19日 在美国审核
Blackberry Passport.  It's the phone you need!,"I have had numerous Android phones in the past, the last being a Nexus 6.In my opinion, none of them are as great as this Blackberry Passport!The size and quality of the Passport is outstanding!The high level specifications make it run as well if not better than the Nexus 6.The screen is of high quality Gorilla Glass, and the display is better than any phone I have had before.The keyboard is great and I don't see how I could ever go back to the old on-screen keyboard again!The Blackberry operating system works fine and can run Android Apps if you need to.I found that in many cases you don't need an app because with the Blackberry Browser you can do just as well.For example, instead of using the Twitter App, just go to the Twitter login site using the Blackberry Browser, then in the Browser menu, select ""Add To Home Screen.""Now you have an icon on your home screen for Twitter which will take you directly to the site.I find that the browser works better on the site than the app.You can do this for many other applications too.The screen format makes it very comfortable to view and create documents.I can finally see those microscopic sized email messages that slide off the screen when you try to zoom in on them.Blackberry formats them to fit the screen.Nice!There's not enough room on this review to compliment all that the Blackberry Passport offers.So, get it and try it out for yourself.I highly recommend the Blackberry Passport.It's solid, secure and reliable!",2015年6月12日 在美国审核
BlackBerry reveiw by a BlackBerry guy,"Don't let the unlocked phone thing scare you. I almost didn't buy this because people said you'll have issues using it on tmobile. Nope, no issues. I bought the Tmo sim card, took less that 2 min to call tmobile and have a working phone. I love the passport, many great things about the phone. You will have to adjust to the new keyboard, but its really not bad. Very firm quality feeling buttons. Battery does last for days. The ONLY thing I don't like is the fact that there are no hard keys for numbers. Not a deal breaker, this is an excellent upgrade from the Q10. Nice to have a very good camera, I swear the fbi could read my finger prints off the photo of my hand, wasn't even a close up pic. Auto correct spelling light years ahead of the Q10.

The iPhone 7!,"Nothing more to say.Well, now there is. I finally got mine yesterday and it is one mean device. Typing is a dream with the keyboard. And i'm swiftly getting used to the 4th virtual row. Web pages on the beast's 4.5 screen are brilliant and unparalleled.The size doesn't bother me in the slightest. Slips in and out of my pocket quite smoothly. So, as I say, dimensional size not a problem, though I will mention the weight will take a few days. Doesn't feel at all unwieldy or 'top heavy' as some have groused. Weight sits well in my hands during use, but the weight in the pants pocket will take a few days. I'm hardly fretting.Then there's the Wow! factor. When I nipped to the AT&amp;T store here in Ellensburg, to acquire my nano-SIM, the jaded 20-somethings behind the sales counter literally exclaimed, Wow! Quite amusing and somehow I felt a partially-guilty sense of revenge? Yep, revenge.Phone call quality is unsurpassable.

"A Two Day Use Review - Bottom Line, It's Quickly Becoming My Favorite Phone of All Time!","Ok, where do I start?A little background first I suppose so you know where I stand.I've been a Blackberry fan since the Curve days but we have a Samsung Galaxy 5, an Iphone 5, an Ipad and a Blackberry Playbook in the house.I have used Android as a daily driver before but I've always preferred the simplicity and business mindedness of the Blackberry ecosystem.I moved from a Z10 before this purchase.I'm not a media hound on a phone (I can watch movies, view DirectTV, etc. on the Ipad, although you can certainly do all this with the Passport).My profession involves reading a lot of large format documents like PDFs, CAD files, GIS documents, etc. and I wanted something where I wasn't constantly scrolling around and zooming in and out.The Passport seemed the perfect blend between laptop and smartphone where I might be able to do all of this.So for the review.Initial impressions are, this thing is an absolute beast.When you open the box, the first thing that comes to mind is, oh man, how am I going to carry this around with me?After a day or two with it though, that feeling quickly disappears and, if you're migrating from a smaller device like a standard iphone or previous Blackberry model, you'll wonder how you ever got along without the wide format.As others have said, the build quality is unparalleled.There's no cheap plastic, it has a solid feel, if not a little heavy, and I am confident (although I'd never do it, ha) that I could skip it across a parking lot and it would come up a little bruised but work perfectly fine.Blackberry hasn't had a premium feel phone like this since the 9900 series but if you picture a mega sized version of that, a 9900 on steroids, if you will, you'll get the idea.In short, it fits into the front pocket of a normal fitting pair of pants perfectly fine.You can read all of the other reviews about the merits of BB10 so I won't go into detail about that ecosystem too much, just some of the functionality.Echoing most opinions is that the hub is bar none the most genius thing about the phone and I haven't found anything in it that I look for that isn't there.It is extremely well thought out and much deserved of the glowing reviews it's gotten.I'm constantly having little friendly `one up' debates with the other phone users in our house.Can your phone do that, kind of stuff like, can you move files back and forth on the fly?Or the seamless out of the box streaming opportunities with your home network, or the `let me check my calendar' kind of stuff, while then editing the calendar and e-mailing an invite, all while on a phone call.I think I'll check the weather too while I'm at it...My point is that this is a multi-tasking business phone through and through and if you approach it with that mind-set, you won't be disappointed.That said, it handles media files perfectly well too and allows you to use it for fun when you want.I've read several reviews which indicate that because it's a square phone, the biggest detractor is that videos can't be shown in 16:9.Not true.The format is only slightly, and I mean barely noticeable slightly smaller than my Z10 (1/4""?) was and if you lay my son'siphone over it, it produces an image of just about the same size.It's just that you have black bars above and below your video, because the screen isn't 16:9 shaped.Really not a big deal at all.Everyone wants to know about typing.I sorely missed leaving a full QWERTY for a glass touch in the Z10.While I got used to touch, I still got annoyed with it and sometimes, you just don't bother responding to someone like you used to because the proofreading becomes maddening.Make no mistake, there is a huge learning curve with this keyboard.Not so much the typing as you can master that in a day, but with the 4th (virtual) row.A real QWERTY layout has all of the punctuation marks on the bottom.The virtual row is of course, at the top which is really disconcerting at first.I've had the phone for a few days now and I'm slowly getting used to it but I have no doubt that I'll master the change.Make no mistake though, it is weird.The keyboard capacitive sensing touch feature is pure genius and it makes scrolling through web pages a dream.Very mouse on desktop computer like where the display moves around without you needing to drag your finger directly over it.Apps?I have found that there are very few apps that don't work and those that have a problem almost always require a Google account to function.Things like Strava which constantly needs Google Services to talk to the mother ship for example.No thanks, I'll find an alternative.I'm not sure what other phone allows you to tap into its native app world and competing app worlds like the Google Play Store and Amazon at the same time.This is one of its biggest selling points as far as I'm concerned.All of the major apps are available and the phone comes with some of those already baked in all while integrated into its messaging system.Facebook, Twitter, Linked in, Dropbox, Box, etc. etc. are all there.What's great is that file sharing is already linked up with all of those accounts too.Just hit share, select which service you want the file to go to and, voila.Dropbox and Box even allow you to automatically upload pics and videos on the fly when they're recorded.Instant cloud storage, if that's your thing.I use this all the time to send large data files back and forth to clients.All of the things that other reviewers have said are absolutely true.Big, beautiful display, lightning fast OS, huge battery life (easily gets a day and a half of heavy use.My z10 was awful in this regard), and a communication powerhouse.Camera is the best out of any BB I've owned and I would rate it on par with my son's iPhone.I am so happy with this thing that it isn't even funny.Lastly, and I could care less what people think, but it is worth mentioning that your day will be tied up in an inadvertent sales pitch when you pull this beast out during a meeting or at a coffee shop.You will find that people will be caught between surprise, bewilderment, and laughter because it is so different.In the end, they will all ask what it is and where it came from.And, while it is not for everyone as should be plain to see, it has left many impressed.",2014年11月19日 在美国审核

BlackBerry reinvented and empowered.,"9:40I bought this product last week and used it over the weekend. I didn't see it before ordering it, because here in Spain all the network operators removed all support to BlackBerry. You can find almost every brand, except BlackBerry.So, was forced to buy it overseas. Cool, right?Passport arrived quickly: indeed I paid a priority shipment. When I opened the box, I was shocked. I knew it was big and squared-shaped, but WOW, it's huge! I fell in love with it immediately.After receiving it I had to buy a nanosim, so I went to my operator's local store. I asked for the nanosim, turned the passport down, and removed the little cover. The girl which attended me looked at the BlackBerry logo and grinned, saying that crappy device needed a sim, not a nano. I flipped the device and she was as shocked as I when I saw it the first thime. 'Is this a BlackBerry?' she said. Funny anecdote :)As a former Q10 owner, the device has still some features I've never seen, and which I'm now using and will use in my daily work.BlackBerry Blend allows you to do everything you can do in Hub but from your computer. It's fast, seamless and very easy to do. You can see notifications, answer emails and, well, everything. Watch any demo in YouTube and you'll understand.The touch-enabled keypad works as magic. I'm still getting used to it, but I think I will use it a lot. A nice function that differentiate it from all the other devices.In short, I've loved the Passport from day one.9:48I've spent almost ten minutes to write this review. Considering I needed to think twice every sentence - I'm spanish -, I think I write pretty fast with the physical keyboard, compared to my touchscreen typing.If you can, try to use the Passport.

Powerful Productivity Tool,"As an initial disclaimer, I have NEVER written a review of anything but felt compelled to do so with this product.Back in the day, I was an original Blackberry user all the way through the bold 9900.Then I moved on to the iPhone, Android phones (Samsung S4, 5 and Nexus) and most recently the Samsung Note 3.For the most part, I have been happy with these phones for business productivity etc.However, as you can see from the long list, they all lack something and they all were never quite right.This is especially true in the areas of battery life and ""single-device"" replacements while traveling without a laptop or tablet.I pre-ordered my Blackberry Passport from Amazon and it has been my “daily driver” for the past several weeks.Simply put, this is an amazing device, pure and simple.I really cannot understand what the “experts”are talking about in their “official reviews”.They just don't make sense, if you approach this device for what it is, a business productivity tool.In this capacity, it is near perfect.It is not an iPhone or Android phone nor similar to anything on the market.It is a unique device and should be reviewed as such. YES it is big device, but so are other single-device replacements emerging on the market.If you are not in the market for this type of device, simply look elsewhere.To criticize the passport for it not being similar to “traditional” smart phones currently on the market is irrational. From my point of view, the unique aspect ratio and business oriented use of this device is what makes it so special and successful.The passport feels and handles extremely well.YES, it is a two handed devise but the physical keyboard is spectacular.After using the Passport for one week, it was impossible for me to return to a touch screen keyboard.The Apps issue has definitely improved for Blackberry.The Passport ships with the Amazon App Store.Between the native Blackberry store and Amazon I was able to find ALL of the Apps that I normally use, keeping in mind that I am not a gamer.One important benchmark that I am extremely sensitive to is battery life.Having had the Passport since its release, I have found that I can get two or even three days on a charge with normal usage.In contrast, my iPhone often needed to be charged mid-day.This is a big deal especially if you travel internationally.As stated above the BlackBerry Passport is not for everyone. It is designed to be used as a single-device productivity tool. As such, it is a powerful and remarkable tool for those who want this type of device.",2014年10月11日 在美国审核

"Experience Using Passport in and around Kolkata, India","Even though I love new gadgets, I tend to give them pass unless I am totally confident of value for money.

My buying decisionI have been a user of modest phones - Nokia E61i, Blackberry curve. But I have experienced Lumia, Samsung, Moto Android phones of family and friends. Could not see the purpose of having those phones for quite long time. Most utility apps - IRCTC, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Freecharge, Maps had bugs and usability issues.When I studied the PP specs and booklet published by Blackberry, I instantly decided to try it. But the Indian Amazon priced it Rs. 50,000. Then, US Amazon gave a black friday offer of USD 500 and I had it delivered to Kolkata. It took Rs. 35,000 inclusive of all taxes and charges.2. Traveling in train in and around KolkataLast week, I was traveling with this in local trains from Kolkata to suburbans. This area has quite good 3G connectivity from Airtel and Vodafone. And I installed Headlines Today Android app. If you run the Live TV option in the HT App, it will open the TV's video stream in native passport browser in full view. Everybody seating around me came closure to have a good view of the live TV streaming. In Chinsura (Hooghly), I Skyped my wife. The video and voice quality was simply superb.Some questions my fellow travelers asked me: What is this? Is this a phone or a tablet? Is it available in India? How much is the price?3. My comments on few more thingsHub: This is neat. Whenever and wherever you are, you can achieve the primary goal of a phone - communication, in the best possible way. Can't remember I felt this much at ease in being in touch with my colleagues, business, friends and family.Battery: I have bought a Moto G (Second Gen) for my wife only a month ago. They say Android is a software engineering marvel. Can a phone afford to drain its battery in just 2 hours? In comparison, I keep 4-6 apps open in Passport. But, BB PP runs for more than a day.Reading: Lot of people are complaining about its odd form factor. I would urge them to read emails and websites in PP and then any Android phone. You will get the answer.Writing: I got an excel sheet with many rows and columns to calculate an EMI. It was nice the way I could enter the amounts to calculate.4. InnovationLots have been written about innovations. The credit is taken mostly by the other two. One design innovation I have found awesome is your ability to manage your activities through multiple apps. All the apps are kept open in thumbnails in the homepage. (In comparison, you press a button in Android to go to the app list to close).Criticisms5. BB Assistant: May be I need to explore BB Assistant. Tried Google Now. It clearly and immediately picks up my Indian accent. Can't say the same with Assistant.6. Android apps: Yes, some apps are crashing down - Coursera, Microsoft office mobile.",2014年12月13日 在美国审核

Passport is extremely good both in hardware and software departments,"giving it 5 stars since I'm long BBRY stock:)More honest rating is 4 stars.Passport is extremely good both in hardware and software departments.BB OS 10 is extremely stable and BB Hub is very convenient for dealing with emails and all sorts of messaging (linkedin, sms, bbm, twitter, etc.)Android emulation delivers apps for which there are no native analogues (e.g. RunKeeper, TuneIn radio, Amazon Music, LiveJournal, Amazon Kindle, parking apps, banking apps and many many more).Unfortunately not all of these android apps works as smoothly and stable as I'd wish.And purely native apps do not cover everything.",2015年1月24日 在美国审核
Absolutely Love this device,"Absolutely Love this device. I bought it a year ago - so this review is based on 1 year worth of use. I'm an IT professional myself, I've owned the first blackberry that ever came out. Do not underestimate the quality of these things. I know everyone loves their iPhone which I think is a complete dummy. Android on the other hand is Ok but they can never figure out the battery life. I own Samsung S6 Edge and this thing overheats and the battery dies in like 3 hours. Blackberry OS is so much batter than iOS and Android OS (when it comes to general functionality - not enough apps of course). I Still use this device for business because my Android device (Good Work client for business) is not nearly as robust and reliable. The battery on this device is fantastic. It lasts me for 3-4 days without charging. I can also install Android apps, just install 1mobile apps store and you are good to go. In general I still love blackberry - I am a loyal fan. Its always fast and reliable. The camera is fantastic. I love the big screen, once you get familiar with all the gestures, bells and whistles - this thing is the king.",2015年10月16日 在美国审核
We're all Apple fans in my family and love Apple products,"Just couldn't be more impressed with my new Blackberry Passport.It's just a hell of a phone optimized to be a communications center rather than an entertainment device.We're all Apple fans in my family and love Apple products, including our iPhones, but Passport running the new OS 10.3+ is just another animal altogether, setting the standard, in effect, for what an ""adult"" smartphone can and should be. The ""Hub"" is an outstanding tool for managing all communications, i.e., emails, texts, calls, etc., in one location/app, and the screen and touch-enabled keyboard are just as excellent. The work flows are incredibly intuitive and there's enormous functionality built right into the Passport's native OS. And the battery life is just monster, giving a day and a half of active use on a full charge.There were lots of early reviews by bloggers that panned the Passport; now, having used mine for over a week, I have to say that those reviews appear to have been unfairly biased, and issued either from diehard iPhone users who just refused to take the Passport on its own terms, or reviewers that didn't really take the time to put the device through its paces.The one caution with the phone is that you won't be happy with it if you have very tiny hands.That's about the only negative I can think of.My wife (who's long slender fingers allow her to hold myPassport and type easily with one hand) is waiting for the white one to become available in November.(She's keeping her iPad but giving up her iPhone 4S.)",2014年10月16日 在美国审核

"The perfect device, but takes some work to get it humming with Google services.","This thing is a beast.Unfortunately side-loading Android apps can be a difficult affair.But if you're technically daft, it's worth the hassle.For instance, my workplace communicates with Slack and when traveling the wifi cut out during a critical operation.The BlackBerry was suddenly my lifeline; the keyboard performed flawlessly.That being said, it's not without its inconveniences, even if you are a geek like me.If your workplace uses Google Apps, note that the ""flag"" in BlackBerry hub does correspond to STARRING emails in Gmail, and ""delete"" corresponds to ARCHIVE.It should remain this way as long as BlackBerry doesn't do anything crazy, due to the way things work in Gmail:https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78755?hl=en...but of course it's completely non-obvious from the UI.You wouldn't know unless I told you.With the Android native Gmail app it's much simpler (for obvious reasons).When it comes time to sync your calendar with Google Apps, you may not be as pleased.You should really save yourself a lot of bother by disabling your coworkers' accounts using:https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselectYou might think you can sideload Gmail and Google Calendar.You can't, really.At least, I couldn't figure out how to, the apps seem to require Google Play Services.Other Google apps such as Google Maps work fine, though, which is great because the BlackBerry equivalent is even worse than Apple Maps.There are moments that the Android emulation will simply irk you.oauth2 application-specific authorization schemes don't work.Assistive device support for LastPass filling in passwords in the native password widgets ... doesn't work.If you try to use the ZXing app to snap barcodes from within Google Authenticator it'll crash.Chrome doesn't seem to work, either, leaving my bookmarks stranded.If you go look at BlackBerry World you will see the reviews are worse than Youtube comments.They have about as much information in them, and about as many misspellings.The native ecosystem is basically terrible beyond what RIM themselves produce -- and even then, for instance, the Foursquare app doesn't let you log in with the credentials you've already entered in Facebook.If I were working at RIM I would focus all my efforts, and I mean ALL OF THEM, on the Android emulation.I would not abandon QNX (the underpinnings of BB10) because Android doesn't have decent text control(s) anymore (ever since the trackball disappeared from the Nexus One), but I'd make sure the rest of the system beat Android at its own game.That being said, even in the current state I bought the device.I DON'T CARE.Do you hear me Android manufacturers?I DON'T CARE.There simply is no other device whose form factor allows me to PRODUCE instead of CONSUME.The Droid 4 was released in February 2012, 2.5 years ago, and was a slider.The candybar form factor and keyboard atones for the sins of the OS.",2014年11月9日 在美国审核

This is a phone built around a brilliant 1440x1440 display,"This is a phone built around a brilliant 1440x1440 display, and that is it's major selling point. Long time BlackBerry users will find the width and the key layout awkward at first but eventually it becomes familiar. This phone is very well built - it's solid and durable. The Passport's battery easily survives a day of heavy usage; it will only need to charge when you sleep. The entire keyboard works as a trackpad for scrolling, panning, or moving the editing cursor right where you need it. There are a few minor downsides - I would have preferred the USB port in the upper right side like a traditional BlackBerry, the metal trim on the sides is curved, narrow, and smooth making it feel like it wants to leave your grip, and the ""on/lock"" button on the top isn't recessed and can be hit accidentally in your pocket. And lastly, it's GSM only - I had to leave Verizon to use this phone and miss them already.

So much better than my Google Nexus 5,"So much better than my Nexus 5! I updated my nexus 5 to Lollipop, and Google changed the email app UI to RED, and I have no way to change it (WHY?)! I had no choice but to give up the Android.What I really like the most about Blackberry passport:1. The Blackberry Blend. I installed on my Mac Pro, and it works flawlessly. I hope they could include the Remember in their future release.2. The hub. It's so convenient, and the emails are always faster than my Outlook, Mac email client, and gmail APP.3. Keyboard.As for the APP concerns, I moved most of the purchased/free Android APPs to Passport. It's fairly easy: 1. download a APKextrator App on your Android phone. Extract your APP into an APK file, put it on cloud (like ""Box""),2. On your Blackberry, open the APK with File Manager, and it will automatically install your Android APP. But those APPs requiring google account, like google map, won't work.Oh, one more thing, reading ebook (like kindle, or epub) on Passport is a great experience because of the size and the shape of the screen.

Perfect screen shape and fairly good security options,"Just a brief review here, from perspective of someone who put off a smart-phone purchase over concerns about security (and long-term contracts for service) and dissatisfaction with the idea of viewing content on a tiny phone screen.The square screen on the Passport is great. Documents and web pages read easy. I often increase or decrease the page size, so margins perfectly fit the width of the screen, and I only have to scroll up or down. This is great on eyes like mine (I wear reading glasses). You can also set it up to magnify on 3 taps of two fingers - a feature I find very useful on complex web pages.For privacy, I like that the Passport prompts you for specific permissions on every app you load. You can allow logically needed permissions, and deny illogical permissions that seem like privacy invasions. You can (and I recommend one should) disallow permissions until you actually use the app. And I actually prefer that the app store is not cluttered with the thousands of apps of its competitors, with so many likely to invite security and privacy intrusions. The BlackBerry app selections are practical enough, and I always read reviews to learn if they contain spyware. But I'm more cautious and less interested in lots of apps, than many other users may be. You can easily encrypt your data. To me, the security emphasis is a selling point for BlackBerry.I do have some complaints - some of the swipes and gestures are too similar, and sometimes I get different results from a gesture or swipe than I intend. However, I very much like that you can choose to swipe either the screen OR the keyboard. It helps to keep your fingers out of the way of view of what is on the screen, as you move text up, down, left or right by swiping gestures on the keyboard. As a new smartphone user, I am impressed by the technology. The most difficult editing, though, is cut and paste, especially if you have larger than petite fingers. At least for me, it is difficult to get the phone to select the exact text I intend, or for the cursor to move exactly where I intend. Long emails and compositions are best done on a computer, but I've done lengthy emails on the Passport. I just have to be satisfied with minimal editing as I compose.On the other hand, the hub and its access to each email account, text messages, phone messages and contacts are fantastic. Scheduling events and reminders is very easy and useful. Again, the large square screen format makes all this work much easier.And, as a phone, I felt weird for about a minute then came quickly to feel that this phone size is no problem at all, held up to the ear. The sound quality is great from the speaker, and friends tell me the quality of my voice is very clear.I love that the battery lasts for days, though I try not to let it run down below 60%. This means charging every other day for pretty regular use.",2015年1月25日 在美国审核
"Odd, but great","I purchased this phone based on the reviews and looking for something that is secure and different. I switched from an iPhone 5s. Honestly, I was a bit put off with its square share out of the box. It looked unique and interesting, yet odd. I was planning to return it after about 2 days, but I ended up using it until now (It's been about a month) and I'm loving it. I've never used a physical keyboard like this and the OS is so fluid and smooth. Battery life lives up to the claims, I sometimes forget to charge it at night and it lasts through the next day. It's definitely a convo starter and usually they start with ""What is that?!"" followed by ""That's pretty cool""The only things I don't like about it would be the compatibility with some of my other devices. I know BB is working on something to address it, however for now it's an annoyance. Also, some Android side loaded apps require Google Play services which can be overridden, but it's difficult initially.",2014年12月19日 在美国审核

Elegant is the word!!,"I bought this phone from Amazon and have been using it for about two weeks. The first thing that makes you love this is the premium feel to it. The build quality is simply outstanding.Caveat before buying if you haven't really used a BB before: You need to go in with an open mind as the BB 10 OS will take some time before you get well versed with it, but it becomes a breeze once you do get used to it.Like many users have said, do not buy this if you are one of those people who like downloading a few random apps every second day to your phone. Do not buy this, if your exposure to Android or IOS has made you heavily reliant on Google Services and any lack of ease running them will be a deal breaker. There are workarounds though for everything, but they are workarounds. Do not buy this if you are a phone camera freak. There are better phone cameras out there. This one has a competent camera but may not be enough for a lot of people.Buy this phone if you need a long battery life. It has been lasting me two full days. I am a moderate user and with similar usage, the android never lasted more than a day. Buy this phone, if you are looking for an elegant way to manage all your communication from a single screen....BB hub is an amazing and a simple concept. Buy this phone for its great performance, its smooth and fast. Buy it if you want to get away from the ubiquitous Android and Iphones and looking for something else that can do the same things (that you require). Buy this if you are looking for a head turner, this phone is indeed a premium piece of design and looks the money's worth.

Invested in a Solid Device Not Disappointed!,"Exceeded my expectations. This device gets me through the day I work A LOT. Great for communications and superb typing experience. The battery is good for an entire day with heavy use, and two or mor days with moderate use. As far as design, I enjoy picking up and using the device daily. The construction is solidUI is futuristic and easy to use. I really love the fact that all my communications are organized for me in one place. I can access important emails from any app by using the swipe gesture. Tasks and to do lists come super handy too. BlackBerry really did a fantastic job in anticipating uses for their new software. The Remember app in particular acts as a personal and business project management CMS. I can attach voice notes or images to notes and even add tasks directly to my calendar.I literally had my hands full on more than one occasion. There's this voice assistant button to the right of your device. When you press the button you can say things like ""whats my schedule like"" and it will tell you about meetings for the day. You don't have to type if your hands are full or you have the device next to you on your desk and you're multitasking.Regarding the square screen: WOW. I am able to digest so much more content on my device. You can also increase the font size so you're not squinting or dreading reading anything.Phones aren't something you should take for granted. They are your operational and competitive tools in business. I can absolutely recommend that anyone upgrading from a different platform or even the older model BlackBerry evaluate and purchase the BlackBerry Passport.

The best smartphone you can get today,"Passport is my first ever BlackBerry and I am truly amazed with this device. I think Passport deserves all these 5 stars!!!The hardware spec is top, the build is premium and the BlackBerry OS is solid. Every detail is well designed to suit mobile professional's needs. Battery on Passport is quite impressive, especially if you are coming from a competing high end smartphones.Different blogs and websites tried to underestimate Passport. DON'T LISTEN to them. None of the ""shortcomings"" that you may have read about Passport really exist. Passport has no usability problems and you can operate with one hand unless your hands are really tiny. The only weakness of Passport is when it comes to watching videos. So, if watching videos is your Number 1 priority, Passport probably should not be your choice.Of course you may not find ALL apps that you might have used on Android but through the Amazon store you can install most of such apps. I am still lacking a couple but I can live without them. Overall, I did not feel shortage of apps. Do you care if there are 10,000 apps or 200,000 if you only use 50? On Android I had 70 apps installed.But then comes a whole array things where NO other smartphone can compete:1. S.E.C.U.R.I.T.Y ... You cannot imagine how many security settings you get on BB. I have never kept sensitive info on my smartphone. On Passport I feel I can.2. The screen is brilliant. It's even better than that in new iPhones. I thought my Sony Xperia Z had a fantastic screen but a side by side comparison talks loud. Passport wins.3. Gestures are fantastic, a bit difficult initially but in a day or two you start thinking how you lived without it in the first place.4. Interaction with the device is very good. BB has quite many settings to adjust the device to your needs.5. KEYBOARD that's something incredible. The first time I showed to friends and associates, we were discussing for half an hour how this capacitive thing could be working.6. Fantastic integration with external services. Ironically, BlackBerry OS has better integration with Outlook email than Windows Phone does.7. BlackBerry HUB. On the software side, the Hub is probably the best thing. You stay control of things happening in your digital life in a single place.8. Blend. The desktop software is incredibly useful. Basically, if you are using a computer, Blend brings the device right on your desktop. Check notifications, read and send messages, emails, text messages. View files, refer to your calendars and tasks.The bottom line? If you need a smartphone beyond killing pigs with birds then Passport shall be your choice.",2014年10月30日 在美国审核
GREAT DEVICE (FORMER ANDROID/APPLE user),"I have been using this device for 3 months already and it's simply amazing. I have used iphones and android devices in the past and none of them provided the type of thrill that his device has brought me. This was my first time using a BB device but honestly the learning curve wasn't that dramatic. I love the fact that I now can type in my bank account passwords without having to worry too much, I love running around with nothing but a phone, no rubber/plastic cases, no screen protector, yet no scratch; I love the fact that no matter where I go, student dorm, IKEA, supermarket, airport, there will always people stopping by and asking what phone im using and saying they love my phone. The speakers are awesome, the screen is great, the keyboard is solid and overall, very well built device. Yes, there are glitches once in a while (like I type another languages but sometimes BB OS tends to mix up the language input and can't switch back and forth) but hopefully this will improve soon. I traded in my IPHONE 5S and got 375$ back from it. My previous phone was the HTC M7, which was also extremely good but this one just surpassed it in terms of its new look, processing speed and flawless performance.

Back to BlackBerry... Awesome device!,"I have been a BlackBerry user until a couple of years ago when I switched to Galaxy S series (mostly due to lack of apps for BlackBerry). This is my first time of using BlackBerry OS10, the interface looks very mature and gestures to navigate are cleverly designed and very intuitive. The available usable apps are still sparse but I was able to install the Snap app and get several of my favorite Android apps (Flipboard, Spotify, BBC News, SiriusXM, etc) installed (I will try to upload some screenshot to show the look).I have been using a GS5 for the last 2 months or so, but tired of keeping it plugged in to charger and apps crashing. The build quality, long lasting battery and ability to run Android apps (and, of course the physical keyboard, and its beautiful look) made me switch back to Blackberry. BlackBerry Hub (collects all your emails, text messes, social media feeds, etc in one place) has no equivalent in Android and iOS, which increases efficiency. It is designed for business people as well as regular consumers.I am getting 4G LTE coverage on T-Mobile network at most places.I see some people are complaining about Passport being big/clunky and heavy. Yes, it is big, because it has a touch screen AND a physical keyboard, no news here. It is heavy because it was made of premium material (unlike most Android phones) and has a 3450mA battery which easily outlast most phones out there.So far, I have been very happy with the Passport and I highly recommend to people who are on the market for a new phone (but keep in mind that the size of the phone takes getting used to).",2014年10月28日 在美国审核

A side by side comparison with a friend's LG G3 shows the Passport opening and running various Android applications faster than the LG. BlackBerry 10 is ""the better Android than Android"". Buy this smartphone, install ""Snap"" (search Google for a quick how-to guide), setup your accounts, buy one of BlackBerry's premium fast chargers here on Amazon and you'll be set. If you want ease of use combined with the power of a laptop in the palm of your hand without unnecessary complexity, invasions of privacy or constant advertisements, this is the smartphone for you. Satisfy yourself. Dare to be different!",2015年3月25日 在美国审核
Blackberry Passport Black,"I wanted the Blackberry Passport so badly that I gave up Verizon, where I have been a loyal customer for years.The PASSPORT , along with the Blackberry Blend is the most unbelievable smartphone that I have ever seen. It was also the easiest purchase from Amazon.In the past I have had to beg Verizon to sell me a Blackberry.I just hopped online, bought the Passport,took it to T-mobile and have traveled all over without a laptop or my Blackberry Tablet.The touch enabled keyboard is awesome! The wide screen is perfect for writing, reading, watching movies and there are no more mistakes! (trying to hit those little tiny touch screen squares on the small smart phones.)Although, I am just now practicing the Blackberry Assistant, I believe that the saying is going to be true: ""It will do everything but bring you a cup of coffee!!""",2014年12月21日 在美国审核
A device with a purpose.,"The Blackberry Passport is a device with a purpose and is deserving of the time it takes to fully appreciate its many benefits.For those considering the device, there is a slight learning curve, especially for those transitioning from a different OS, but it is time well spent. The OS is extremely fluid and intuitive and the addition of Blackberry Blend allows for seamless and constant connectivity.Physically, the device is 'easy on the eyes' - it is nicely and solidly built and the screen size is, quite literally, easy on the eyes.Blackberry Passport is top of the line and, in the crowded smartphone market, is one of the most innovative devices available.Working Wide; job well done, Blackberry.",2014年12月19日 在美国审核

The BlackBerry I've Been Waiting For,"Fantastic phone! I really enjoyed my Z10 but the Passport is much better in terms of feel and overall usability. Like many have said, the keyboard takes a bit of getting used to but it becomes second nature shortly (I had to type on an iPhone 5S last night and I felt like I was typing on a postage stamp). I miss the Z10's offerings of predictive words as the Passport only offers three at a time, so I don’t find myself using that feature as much now.The screen is outstanding and is very accurate when tapping on links, and with the battery life there's no need to turn the brightness down...I usually notice my screen is the brightest in the room as other phones aren't known for their battery life after a day of moderate use. The 10.3.x UI is also improved and looks more fluid in places compared to 10.2.x of prior models. AT&amp;T LTE works without a hitch all day long.The phone may not always get positive comments, but it always gets attention.

After 2 weeks I returned it to Amazon.Turns out I got more used to the way it works than I knew and was missing the hub and several other smart features.As a person who runs his own business, these features were a leg up!In business, you don't hem and haw - you get what you need.So, I ordered the phone again and am glad to have it, even with the younger OS which is in many ways a much better start than what I remember from the first iterations of Android.The hardware is beyond the pack as well - particularly keyboard and battery life!!! Apps are not so much of a problem - I even have google maps and chrome installed.

I also kept hitting the soft screen when trying to flick the words (Z10 spoiled me).So, I was not greatly impressed to use this phone in the beginning until I saw Blackberry Blend.It is one of the best things in mobile since WebOS and then icloud.

The Hub I thought at first would be cluttered, but it's actually the best way of centralizing and organizing messages that I have ever seen. The app selection is limited, but that doesn't bother me since I use my phone not to play games, but to be productive. Typing is incredibly easy because of the large keyboard and predictive text. The keyboard is also a touchpad for scrolling and and selecting text. The screen is large, but emails and websites are so much easier to read because of it.

Thank you BlackBerry,"The very next day after getting this phone, I went to a business conference. Drove 4 hours, including areas of weak signal coverage. Kept 4G data and Bluetooth handsfree connection on all the way, while sharing internet via hotspot with my passenger for an hour. Used the phone during the conference for e-mails a lot and after almost 18 hours of such heavy work it still shows 26% / 7 hours of battery remaining!This is not a phone. This is a dreadnought. Quite literally. It is made of steel. It is big and heavy. It looks intimidatingly awesome (and expensive).The processor power is weapons-grade, making BB10 OS fluid like a quicksilver.What I like most:1. Screen - 453 ppi. Enough said.2. Capacitive keyboard - got used to it immediately. I only touch the screen to unlock the device. Keyboard scrolling response is perfect.What I dislike most:1. Speakers are very good. Too good. Which means, that when you punch in a phone number, the feedback tone is embarrassingly loud and BB10 OS does not allow volume adjustment for this particular function.Thank you BlackBerry. I am very happy with my phone. This is my second BB10 device. The first one was (still is) Z10. Used it for three years. Never ever had any problem, except the battery capacity.

Almost Perfect!,"As an Android user living in Hong Kong, I was tired of iOS and Android which did not offer anything new in the past two years. Attracted by the ""touchpad"" keyboard of Blackberry Passport, I decided to give it a try. On the pricing of the phone, there is substantial difference between the US price and the Hong Kong price even after taking into account of the shipment fees. So I bought it from Amazon US. Unfortunately, the device I received was defective that the screen was dark all the time no matter what I did to it. Thanks to the supportive Blackberry CS staff and the efficient return policy of Amazon, I successfully returned the defective device and received a new one in 2.5 days.Pros:- Screen: Sharp and clear. The square shape gives me a new experience when browsing websites, viewing FB and Twitter, and taking photos.- Battery: Amazing. As powerful as what other reviews suggested, I just need to charge the device once per two days.- Keyboard: Scrolling webpages using the touchpad keyboard is great. However, this functionality does not work in a few apps/webpages. And the typing experience using this keyboard is good.- Voice quality: Voice quality is amazing though a bit artificial. The noise cancellation works very well.- Signal: Not sure if it is strong or not. But at least I can receive signals at places where I could not when using my old Android phone which is Sony Xepria T1.- OS: Biggest surprise to me.Being also a Q10 user (from my company), my experience on BB10 was just soso originally. Probably the screen was too small for me to do the gestures properly. But BB10.3 on Passport is a big improvement. It is so smooth even when many apps and webpages were opened. The page showing all your working apps is so great. I can easily shift to another app or close an app. I can enjoy better multitasking than when I were in Android.- BB Hub: Great and helpful. It is not that useful on my Q10 since I use it to read my company email only. But it is really useful in my Passport. It helps me to consolidate my Whatsapp, WeChat, hotmail, gmail, SMS, FB and Linkedin messages! I don't need to open these accounts one by one just to check and reply the messages. It can improve your efficiency.- Camera: Very nice photos. Fast shutter speed but the focus is a bit slow sometimes.Cons:- Availability of apps: It still has to improve in this area. I cannot use Line and Google Map on this device. Yes I can use Snap but I only want to use it when it becomes more perfect. There should still be some compatibility issues when using Android apps on BB10.- The material used on the back: It is not bad but it can become greasy when your hand is not 100% clean. I like the material on Q10 more.- Waking up the phone accidentally: I usually put my device in the pocket of my trousers. When there is a call and if I miss it, the phone will be ""woken"" up and opening up unnecessary functions when my leg is touching the screen. Of course, I also faced this problem when using my Android.All in all, I am very happy with Passport and it works better than I expect. I would like to give it 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.",2014年11月27日 在美国审核

Reset/changed 'Windows 10' firewall and then reboot. Just changing/resetting the firewall setting and then restarting 'Blackberry Blend' didn't work. Had to reboot too.

It has gone over 24 hrs in the past.- The crystal clear screen.Wow.-Project your movies/video through the MHL port, Miricast wifi, whatever you want.-Charges with a normal micro usb cable.No extra money spent on proprietary cables.-Expandable memory.I have a 128GB sdcard, plus the internal 32GB.POW! That's 160 GB memory.-Blackberry Blend.Manage your phone from your desktop without having to physically touch your phone.Makes working at your desk efficient, and when you're done, there is no trace of any info left behind.-Security, security, security.The best there is.-icloud?who needs that.Access your hard drives at home through Link and have AS MUCH STORAGE AS YOU WANT all safe and secure.Nobody will steal your important docs and nude pics.I could go on and on.This phone is innovative, a breath of fresh air, and is plain fun to use.Try it for 1 week and you wont go back.",2014年11月11日 在美国审核

Pleasant surprise,"I am going to make an admission here: I ordered the Passport BY MISTAKE.I was awaiting the end of the previews with my son at the movie theater and fiddling on my Samsung Note 3, and I twisted the phone to show him a picture of the Passport, and my thumb trembled on the 1-click purchase button.Screen changed to ""Thanks for your Order""... 1-click is DANGEROUS.We laughed, and I assumed I would just cancel the order when I got home.It was a matinee.When I got home, I had an email stating ""Your Order had been Shipped"" and, sure enough, I had paid for the Passport.Not that it freaked me out, but I didn't intend to spend 500 plus dollars that day.Now it is here.So I figured I would try it out and return it.I'm not returning it.First trip was to the AT&amp;T store for a nano SIM.This is a company store, big and bright and fully staffed.They didn't know what it was.They had no Blackberries on display.While they figured out the SIM, the salesman and two other salesmen asked if they could look at it.Slightly irritating because I wanted to look at it, but I am a nice guy and I obliged for TEN FULL MINUTES while it was passed around and smudged by all manner of humans in the store.It was comical.The consensus was that it was fluid and quick and the screen was brilliant.So, I finally got it back, and here are my observations coming from a dedicated Android background, as a very heavy all day user for business purposes.I use three batteries a day and the Note 3 lasts a LONG TIME.I use it a lot.The Passport is solid and businesslike.The Black one looks like something from a high end office supply store, from the legal section.It is very solid and nice.I cannot make it creak.The keys are still stiff, but they are very solid too and will loosen over time (I had Blackberries years ago--they are like shoes that have to be broken in).One salesman asked me if the screen bothered me.I set the Note 3 on the bench next to the Passport, opened the text messaging app on both, and there is MUCH more screen on the Passport with the Android keyboard open (which is the usual mode for me).That was an eye opener.My phone is a phone first .So the first thing I did was make a call.The voice from the other end was extremely clear.My voice was reportedly very clear.I think the Note 3 is a pretty good phone so I called the same person back. He said his end sounded the same but, for the first time, my end sounded hollow to me.I told him I would call him back again on the Blackberry, and set it on the console in speaker phone mode while driving between 35 and 55 with some traffic around me.He was unaware that I was on speakerphone!My car is 15 years old--not quiet.That is amazing.I paired my Plantronics and Yurbuds headsets (Bluetooth) and car with complete ease (as expected).Back home and to let it update; all painless.I use Google Apps for domains (paid version of GMAIL) and the setup took maybe a minute.All of my calendar entries and contacts appeared and I was good to go.Now to apps.The Blackberry has many apps built in--this is not novel in this day and age, but they are very intuitive to use.The Blackberry Hub, in particular, is an amazing innovation and I assume Blackberry has a tight patent on it because if it didn't, everyone would have a hub.The hub shows all of your messages, calls, notifications, and anything else of note, and with a simple gesture on the screen you can either open the hub or just take a quick look without leaving what you are doing.Very slick.But I want more apps...Blackberry world is the first place to look for an app because the native apps, I am told, run and are integrated better.I already had some paid apps from my old Blackberry days and installed one that logs my calls and text messages to my calendar, and another that can record my calls.They worked perfectly.But the real story is the Android apps.Amazon App Store is preloaded, and I have lots of paid and free apps there.I downloaded several, including many I thought could not possibly work.I also installed ""Snap,"" which put me on the Google Play Store and I was able to download more paid apps.Now, on a mission, I downloaded every app that is on my Note 3 (except the Google ones--they won't work), and all of them work with the exception of Amazon Instant Video and, predictably, Google's Chromecast.Some examples of the ones that work flawlessly are an encrypted instant messenger, Netflix, Roku, an unabridged dictionary, legal billing software, photo editors... they all work perfectly.maybe I was just lucky or maybe things have changed, but Netflix was full screen.I finally got sleepy but I installed approximately 30 Android Apps and those two were the only ones that didn't work.To be fair, I do not download games.Reception seems very good.My Note 3 is OK, but has never been as good as a Blackberry for reception (AT&amp;T); I live in an area where reception sometimes matters.I noticed that even when the Blackberry has 1 bar, conversations are clear and data is fast,On the Note 3, you have no data with one bar and choppy conversation.I have the latest OS (whatever downloaded last night), and battery life seems stellar.I have been on the phone nonstop (except for sleep) since yesterday afternoon, and since 5 this morning, and I still have about 75% left.That is really shocking and soothes my frayed nerves about not being able to pop in a new battery.Here is the most amazing part, and I did not know this, even though I have read ALL of the reviews.Of course the entire keyboard is a trackpad; that's pretty neat.But it functions just like a screen keyboard (Blackberry) in the following manner: when you type a word, three suggestions appear above it for completion--you can swipe up under any of the three words and get that word.That is GENIUS.I use Swiftkey (the newest, Beta version) on my Android and it is pretty accurate, but this is better, really.You can choose any of the three by flicking up just underneath it.Exactly what I need for my business communications.Another observation is that the screen is brilliant both in clarity and brightness.I don't know what kind it is yet (LCD, AMOLED, space pod), but it is easily viewable in full sunlight.Now the bad.It is definitely a two handed device.I wear large sized gloves and I can't type on it using one hand.However, the device is not as big as you might think--at least, coming from a Note 3, and the Note 3 was primarily two-handed, too.It fits easily in my dress pants and coats' pockets.The browser seems incompatible with one site I use, a forum, and has to be put in desktop mode.That's not a deal breaker.I can't control my chromecast (but I can control my Roku), so okay that's inconvenient but I will live.Other than that, I have not found any negatives and many, many positives.The device is fast, professional looking, and functional.It works as a phone.It runs Android apps.I don't know what people are talking about when they claim it reboots or gets hot; this one doesn't.It works with my Microsoft Onedrive account and has the native apps to edit word documents.I can even print to my Bluetooth printer (hp100) with an Android printing app.The lack of apps is, to me, simply not an issue because I seem to be able to use everything I could use on my Android.I am not a Blackberry fanboy and I do use my phone all day (even in place of a laptop and landline most of the time) and this device is a winner after what I would call a long string of losers from Blackberry. For a ""flagship"" device it is reasonably priced and I am not tied to a bunch of AT&amp;T bloatware, locked to their service, or locked in some ridiculous contract.This was a very lucky accident for me.Google stuff is VERY convenient and generally well thought out.I may miss it (but I still get my email, calendar, etc.), but there is a price.There is an old saying that if you aren't paying for the product, then you ARE the product.If you use an Android and want to be creeped out, search for ""Google Location History,"" log in, and you will see everywhere you have ever gone with your phone, speeds you traveled, how long you were there, the date and time you were there.That is the tip of the iceberg, it is really shocking (you can turn this off but if you do, no surprise, some functions of google apps don't work).To my knowledge, Blackberry doesn't collect that information on you.I'm keeping it and as soon as I finish this review I am buying a case.",2015年1月30日 在美国审核

Spend your hard-earned $$ and buy the Passport.,"Once I received the Passport, plugged it in and did preliminary tutorials, I was up and running using the keybd in 5 minutes... no BS.I am extremely pleased with the overall interface designed by RIM for the Passport,This includes the physical keypad and the virtual keys/screen design.The functionality is excellent.The amount of typos that I had suffered with are significantly reduced, and I don't have to keep going back correcting my text because I was forced to use a virtual keybd with dinky virtual keys on my previous phone...My next concern was activating an unlocked phone on a carrier.My choice was T-Mobile (compatible with this phone).I went to the local T-Mobile store, bought the required nano-sim (make sure the sales associate knows that it uses a nano-sim) and was activated and online in about 5 minutes.I was taking calls/texting in the store while I finished getting the account set up.Coverage?I am extremely pleased with that as well.Much better than previous carrier on my previous phone.This phone is used primarily in California.Phone call quality?Excellent.If u are using it for business calls, the phone mics and speakers are excellent even if you are outside in a noisy environment.The camera?Also excellent for my purposes.Applications?The built in apps that come with the phone are just what I need to get up and running using this smart phone.Docs to go fits 90% of my needs; Mapping app so far has done well for me.The add-on Device Switch app also eased my transfer of critical information from my old phone to the Passport.I especially like the BlackBerry Hub functionality, and there were no issues setting my google, yahoo and Exchange mail accounts.Skype also works great on this phone, another happy transition!Battery Life??? HAHAHA!!! thats' the best benefit!!! Two FULL DAYS of full-on usage and I don't have to worry about carrying an extra battery pack!!!Phone meetings, e-mails, skyping, text messaging: two days worth before I worry about recharging the phone.And that's how it should be!I would be lucky to get a full day of battery usage from my old phone if that!Why am I taking the time to write this review?When a group of people see this phone and see that it is a Blackberry, the first statement is, ""I thought RIM/Blackberry was dead.""Well folks, they ain't, they are producing an EXCELLENT phone with a great interface that includes a physical keybd in the design.And to the other folks that say, ""...the phone is too big..."" my answer is yeah right, compared to specific models being put out from other vendors?""To me the screen is exactly the right size.Definitely wide enough to quickly read and respond to emails or even edit business documents using the aforementioned docs to go or pdf reader.And I can enjoy a video or two in my dead time on a flight.And yes, I can put it in my pocket, just like my old phone.One last point.Unlike my old phone, adding 128 GB mini sim data card doesn't cost an arm a leg and yer left walnut either!!!",2014年11月30日 在美国审核
My search for a new phone is finally over!,"I have been searching for a new phone for over a year and was about to give up.My Galaxy Note 2 has served me well for 3 years, but I was ready for something new, so I bought a Zenphone 2, but I didn't care for it, so I returned it.Then I bought a Yotaphone 2, which never arrived (long story), then I bought an Amazon Fire phone because it was a good deal, then a Nexus 6.I even considered upgrading to a Note 4, Note Edge, Note 5, and 6 Edge Plus, but although all of the phones were nice and unique in their own ways, they all had one thing in common - they were basically the same because of the Android OS. I've also tried iOS devices in the past (never again).I finally figured out that I wasn't just tired of my Note 2, but I was ready for a different experience altogether and the Blackberry Passport Silver Edition seemed to offer that in spades.Now that I have it, I see that not only is this phone fast, with a crystal clear screen, but it has made me more productive. The Blackberry Hub is incredible because of the way it aggregates all of my text messages, Gmail, LinkedIn, Facebook, Google Talk messages, etc. in one place so I don't have to open 7 different apps to see what's happening.The ability to sideload Android apps using Snap is equally incredible, so I'm not limited to just what's available in the Blackberry store.The camera, call sound quality, screen width, ""advanced interaction"" settings like flip to mute and lift to wake, the quality feel and size of the device itself are all equally impressive.Out of all of the phones I've tried, this is the only one that people have truly been interested in and asked me about when they see it.All of the other devices were basically more of the same; the Blackberry Passport is truly unique.I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone wanting to watch a lot of video (movies, especially) - the square screen isn't suited for that because it's not possible for the video to fill the entire screen.It's fine for Youtube, though.I'm not a gamer, but I can't imagine that it would be great for gaming either.For productivity, however, it can't be beat.It also isn't great if you need to use apps that require Google Services to run, such as the Gmail app, Zillow app and a few others that I tried to install, but couldn't get to work.Doesn't really matter because I can still use their websites on the phone browser and Gmail works much better with the Blackberry Hub anyway. Google Maps and Chrome browser work very well without any issues.I've missed having a physical keyboard since my Kyocera smartphone and Palm Pre days and the keyboard on the Passport doesn't disappoint.I was initially worried about the lack of a shift key and number row, but the way Blackberry handles this is ingenious.Anytime you are typing text, another row appears just above the physical keyboard that has a shift key and number row and the integration is seamless. Also, holding down any letter key on the physical keyboard for an extra half second capitalizes the letter, anyway so the shift key isn't really necessary.It's also great that the keyboard operates as a touchpad, so that you can scroll through web pages and documents just by gliding your finger over the physical keyboard without ever putting a fingerprint on the screen.There is so much good about this device that it's difficult to find fault with it.Needless to say, I'm happy I made the switch.If someone told me that I'd own a Blackberry phone in 2015, I would have never believed it - I thought Blackberry was dead a long time ago, but they have fulfilled a real need with this innovative device.",2015年9月16日 在美国审核

"The first ""Genuis"" Phone!","I am absolutely floored by how well this device is. It is an amazing well designed built phone! Who would of thought having a wide phone would be the one to get me away from the iPhone. Anyway, I immediately took my BlackBerry passport to my local at&amp;t for setup. When I brought it in, I was approached by a rep and he said what is that you have there. When he saw the box and it said blackberry he couldn't believe it. When I opened the box he said ""WOW"" that's a awesome looking blackberry device! He immediately called his colleagues to come take a look at the new blackberry. They all were amazed! Then the customers that were waiting to be seen also approached and were curious to what was going on. Then the customers wanted to know all about the new blackberry. They all couldn't wait for the rep to activate the device and see what it can do. When the setup was finished, everyone in the store was blown away on what the device could do. They loved how fast the device responded. They also loved the new capacitive keyboard and the gorgeous screen. I had several questions to where I purchased the device from and they said they were also going to buy it! I had people searching on their mobile phones about the blackberry passport! One gentleman actually purchased it from Amazon right on the spot!

"You might get the UK version, so be sure to ask the seller before hand.","Title note - I ordered my device, and like a few other reviewers here have found out it was the UK version. The seller made no mention of this, the listing page said nothing of this, and the seller feedback I provided about this was struck through by Amazon since it was ""fulfilled by Amazon."" It arrived with a UK powerplug by BlackBerry, and a cheap plastic non-UL certified adapter that the seller provided; it wouldn't stay in the wall, as the prongs were the same size instead of industry standard, and after a minute or two was hot to the touch. Make sure to ask the seller what version the device is, as I didn't have a UK power adapter and their included solution was frankly unsafe.The phone itself, had I gotten it when it first released, would have been an instant love affair.The size takes getting used to, but having a phone this wide makes sense for two handed use and really fits well if you have larger hands. The software is smooth, no crasheshave occurred and the update process is smooth. I've got a few Android apps running, and the only thing that happens is the music from apps like Spotify or Groove might automatically pause - a simply tap on the play key brings it right back each time.The OS is effectively dead, but the navigation via the touch sensitive keyboard is smart and really makes you wish for the days of Palm; BlackBerry really had something here, even though it obviously didn't appeal to enough people to keep their vision afloat. The main thing I've been surprised with is that it's a really good PHONE - calls and messaging are really where this phone shine, and speaker calls or using a headset make the experience impressive.The typing experience took me two days before I got the hang of it, soon the gestures and shortcuts became second nature and speed was back to normal. If you're coming from the Q10 or Classic and the like the onscreen numbers are the biggest change, but acclimating isn't hard. The Hub is always a favorite feature, whenever I go back to BlackBerry having everything in one place just makes it so much nicer compared to having multiple apps you have to check, and works great with multiple email accounts and work.Battery life is excellent, and I routinely get through the day with 70% of the battery left and ready to go. The device is sturdy, you don't really feel the need for a case here, and the textured backing is much improved over the normal Passports version.There are quirks, the camera takes a second to focus and makes it easier to lose fast moving targets; it's also not the best in low light, so keep that in mind. Video watching on a square screen is obviously going to be hard and less enjoyable, so if you're a YouTube/Netflix junkie this probably isn't a good choice. The browser also takes issue with certain sites security certificates (gfycat is the main one that comes to mind) since it's no longer getting updates, and whitelisting isn't always something it lets you do.Picking a Passport SE in 2016 is weird, but if you're a light app user or not invested into Google's ecosystem you'll find a unique experience that brings back the days when phones were for business and getting work done was paramount. It's an OS that's no longer being developed, by a company that once was an industry juggernaut, but their care and expertise show.",2016年12月9日 在美国审核
I like the QWERTY feature,"after almost a year of having this product, I would say that it is not actually not worth buying it. I like the QWERTY feature, the fact that it has less garbage when accessing emails and Facebook unlike Windows 10 which tries to take over everything in your computer. vi I gave it three stars because it has ok features, but let me specify the cons of having this Blackberry phone:1.Amazon promoted this product, however, most of the apps in the Amazon app store don't support Blackberry passport.You cant even watch video from you Amazon video library.Its funny that you can access youtube and almost everything else.I was excited to but Triple D tv show only to find out that I cant watch it from this phone.A few days after I bought this phone, Viber stopped supporting Blackberry too, Printhand- you have to upgrade and pay 10.00 ( which I did) but still wasn't able to print docs fro this phone.2.When you go to BLackberry app world, it's either apps came from shady source or so expensive to buy.I read reviews before I purchase an app and I haven't read any good reviews.Most of them are rip offs or just scams.It'sgood that you can go to the website like you would in a regular computer, so the apps in the Blackberry world are useless.For example FB- just go to the actual website, no need to download app. or online banking.3.Its annoying that whenever you download files it would automatically save as FAcebook files, I'm not sure if its a big deal or not.4.It has a very big screen, which I like.But it doesn't take good pictures.So far those are my observations,I'm not tech savvy,but theres no rocket science about this phone that I cant learn.If I'm missing something, youre welcome to enlighten me and give me tips about maximizing the use of this phone.The things that I do are very basic, I don't even play games, its just frustrating that simple things like watching video from Amazon or printing docs I m not able to do.",2017年1月26日 在美国审核

Best for what I bought it for,"I'm typing this on my BlackBerry Passport silver edition right now.At first I was big time BB10 user up until I lost my Z30, I always wanted a Passport but just couldn't buy it at the time. So two years later after a significant price drop I decided to take the plunge and get my hands on one as Christmas present to myself.The first thing that struck me was the build quality, it screams premium! Everything was well crafted from the camera lens, the keyboard to the mechanically drilled speakers. The screen quality is very nice and still holds a candle to the smart phones of today. The camera is decent in normal lighting situations but can sometimes struggle in low light.The typing experience so far has been great, I like the physical keys and gestures combo, makes me way more accurate in my daily activities.Battery life is the best in class, after the settling period, usually the first week, I can easily get through 2 days before needing to recharge.AppsDo note that I'm using this as a complimentary device, I have both an iphone and IPad. The iphone is just for FaceTime, Instagram and snapchat and the iPad for viewing and drawing media.BlackBerry 10 OS suffer from a lack of apps but there are many workarounds to resolve this. Some of the apps I need can be found in the BlackBerry world store others can be downloaded via the browser or through third party stores. The stuff I need such as spotify, soundcloud, reddit can all be installed via apks and work really well, without any issues or hiccups. Depending on the app you needs your mileage may vary.One thing that I didn't pay much attention to was the audio, my experience with the sound quality either through headphones or speakers had been nothing short of amazing.All in all you get a full package for what you pay for.

Wonderful phone.,"I have to start off by saying that I've had Apple and I've had Android, they're great. But I love this phone. The keyboard is amazing and the larger than usual screen really didn't take very long to get used to. I had a Blackberry Z10 before I decided to get this one and I really liked it, especially once I upgraded to Blackberry 10.1 and got the android app store. I decided to switch because believe it or not I got really tired of the full touch screen keyboard; I needed buttons back in my life. I'm an office manager/bookkeeper for 3 businesses and a full time student. The Blackberry hub lets me keep all my emails organized and easily accessible for each individual business. All my calls and texts are all together in one place. This phone makes my life a whole lot easier. The voice assistant is great for making calls, sending texts, or even reading back emails when you're on the go, I will say though that it takes a little bit of getting used to. I don't know if it really does but it seems to learn your speech and will pick up things you say faster each time you go through a prompt. The learning comes in handy to shorten the time you spend going through the steps to get to get to a text or call (especially when it comes to people's names). This phone is a amazing piece of technology. However, if you're the kind of person who likes to stick your phone in your back pocket and sit on them where ever you go, you may want to think again. Reluctantly I got a holster for my phone because I was nervous about the width of the phone and it bending and cracking the screen when I sat down. I never actually experience a bend or crack but to be fair I never really gave it a chance to. Overall its an awesome phone and I recommend it to anyone who uses their phone for business and school more than a game center.Also... side note the speakers are louder and more clear than any phone I've ever had before.",2015年8月25日 在美国审核
Best Phone on Market,"Technology is consistently changing. In reality, regardless of the business sector, keeping on the cutting edge, while simultaneously marketing, manufacturing, and delivering the best possible product, is, nearly impossible. However, with sufficient funds, public opinion / market domination can be impacted / maintained for a time—often for decades. Nonetheless, there are different paths to commercial success. Look no further than Microsoft to understand that the best possible product (software in this instance) will not, necessarily, gain and maintain dominant market status. In contrast, Apple, which, at two separate times in its history, had a truly innovative and compelling corporation + product line (both times led by a detail-oriented, largely uncompromising, visionary man). Back in 2009, as with millions of others, I had come to depend upon and enjoy BlackBerry products. But by early 2010, as I tried to access the Internet via my BlackBerry, I was sorely disappointed, as usual, only to see this (then) “new” iPhone device access the Internet easily, just like a miniature version of a ""real"" computer or laptop. Then there was that whole ""touch screen"" thing going on. Like most of you, I was seduced by Apple's rebirth. At that point in my life, it was a timely rebirth, as I desired to smash my Microsoft Vista-driven Toshiba laptop, almost daily, due to it's infuriating software inadequacies; furthermore, having lived (up to that point) all of my computer / laptop / business life with Microsoft products (and various mobile phones, the BlackBerry having been the most superior at that point), I jumped ship completely. I got a high-end, 17"", MacBook Pro, and got the ""new"" iPhone. Fast-forward five years to early 2015. After having jumped on the Apple bandwagon, and having been loyal to their products through the iPad 2 and iPhone 4S, I just didn't feel compelled to buy newer products that ran the same software, but were merely larger (in the case of the phones), or even heavier (in the case of the iPads--until the iPad Air). Yet, there was no real alternative, unless one desired to pursue the Google-driven touch screens (or others who appeared, at least to this consumer, to merely copy Apple's approach). By late 2014, again, I begin to get the same feeling that I had in early 2010, but this time, from the perspective of being a sorely disappointed Apple user. I was continuously disappointed by a disturbing lack of attention to detail, when it came to all Apple software. Then, late last year, I started reading about BlackBerry’s new leader, John Chen, and the new BlackBerry Passport. I did a lot of research via YouTube and other Internet sources. Let me say, right now, that I have nothing to do with the new BlackBerry company, aside from being a customer. But what I am is the CEO of a very small clean energy company, and a man with a family life. At this time, I use the BlackBerry Passport and my significant other uses the BlackBerry Classic. We both can't imagine going back to our ""Apple"" lives, ever again. (Our iMessages were routinely lost and / or delayed for hours, or even days. PDF files opened haphazardly, at best, on iPhones or iPads. Sound quality was absolutely horrible, whether listening or speaking. Emails would appear when they, seemingly, felt like it, regardless of settings. All of these issues and more were never-ending, despite living and traveling throughout a major metro area and always having the latest software updates. I also got sick of Siri, again, seemingly, NEVER being improved, as well as the increasingly child-like appearance of the software. Battery life...don't even get me started, when it comes to my iPhone experience. A joke. And forget about actually opening and working on business docs, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). Now, when my significant other or business partners communicate, we do so with confidence. My text messages hit their devices almost instantly. BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) is even faster, perhaps the digital equivalent of firing a weapon at point blank range. Also, on BBM, with the push of a virtual button on both ends, you can, among other things, instantly connect via video with another BBM user (which is a free app for non-BlackBerry users, by the way). BBM is more like FaceTime / Skype and iMessage combined that actually works. We are audio-visual creatures. When a device serves these two senses well, it becomes a particularly valuable tool. Working quickly and working well, from a visual and audio standpoint is critical. Another example of this is the screen. It's superior. Look no farther. I don’t think any other screen has the 1440 x 1440 pixels. As far as the whole ""square"" thing goes, as far as I am concerned ""It's hip to be sqaure"", because you can actually see content. It's more like a TV than any other device, based just on its size / perspective. I really don't feel that my iPad is my number one tool, any longer, for reading the news (and never was for digesting documents). I'm not young, and the narrow width of other phones is just not helpful, or even natural, to me. Plus there is the keyboard... WOW is all I can say. I'd forgotten how satisfying it is to actually be in control of what you type, rather than relying on whatever potentially dubious outcome Apple produces by virtue of its incredibly annoying auto-correcting. Besides, nearly every word I type is just a light upwards flick anyway, after the device detects my intentions (which is a lot more natural than Apple's approach). It’s a lot faster than I would have imagined, and a simple pleasure too. Look at your phone...when the virtual keyboard appears, how much of your screen disappears? Unless I need special characters, my screen real estate is never compromised. There's a great deal more to say about this device. It is logically designed, both in terms of hardware and software. In one place, I've got my BBMs, texts, emails, notifications, and all alerts from any app (such as Facebook, Twitter, and many more). These items are a swipe to the left away...and, also, can be isolated, enabling you to look solely at texts, emails, etc., as desired, AND all are 100% searchable. Furthermore, it features a browser that allows you to have nine windows open at once, sort of like the old ""Hollywood Squares"" TV show—all,of which, as with every app, can be minimalized with an upwards flick. But, get this...the browser is just one of up to eight apps that you can have opened at one time, and, once again, the open apps are visually displayed as individual squares / rectangles on the device. Therefore, the browser, being just one of these up to eight little boxes that you may have open at one time, can be selected by being tapped, and reveal up to nine ADDITIONAL open windows. If BlackBerry ever changes this appearance, they would be idiots. It's kind of like how the original iPad browser would allow you to open up to eight windows, all of which you could see, until some idiot changed it to tabs because they were (apparently) such fans of Windows. However, with BlackBerry, more than one app can run at a time. Speaking of which, the Passport is super fast. Real fast. I'm no geek, but it's a SnapDragon 3GB RAM that is extremely responsive. (I’ve never heard of SnapDragon before, but I’m keenly aware that my laptop only has 4GB of RAM…) I suppose it's like driving a Tesla versus a quirky minivan. Storage...it's got 32GB built in and you can slide another 128GB in with a micro SD. Yeah... Think of the possibilities. You could carry the Library of Congress, or a heckuva nice music and movie library with a few more SDs in your wallet. Apps? I bought an unlocked Passport. Officially, you have access to both BlackBerry World and Amazon App Store. Unofficially, an unlocked phone owner can tell you that it takes about five minutes to install Google Play too, and I hope, as the device is Android-compatible, that BlackBerry CEO John Chen makes that official, ASAP, if possible (as having Netflix and a number of other apps that are, currently, only available via Apple App Store or Google Play, would prove a real market advantage / win for BlackBerry users). As to app organization, you can organize all apps in folders that you name, plus have access to your actual files on the device, such as pictures, downloads, etc. Speaking of pix and video...it not bad at all. However, you will, at times, want to edit the pix (which you can do, much the same as in iPhoto), and that’s nice to have available on the native camera app. It's got a 13mp rear camera and the one on the keyboard side is 2mp. It defaults to square pix, which is fine with me, and, if one desires, you can re-crop as you see fit, by editing, right on the phone. Battery life...if you run it on full blast, play some videos, utilize full screen brightness, reading all day, yeah, you can kill the battery in 8 or so hours. But, that's literally not looking up from your phone all day and purposely trying to run the battery down. After a week or so of getting familiar with the device, I find that I charge the Passport about once every 36 hours, and I refrain from charging unless the device is near zero, as it's able to go quite a while when it gets below 20% or even 10%. This is in contrast to my iPhone experience, where the darn thing would literally shut off with over 20% charge remaining. So unacceptable. What else can I say...I wouldn't touch Apple with 20' pole, now. When I see an iPhone, I see a popular toy that whose initial technical advantage / innovation and ""wow"" time has passed. If you're a kid, stick with iPhone or its copycats. As for me, I like that I can program my phone to alert me by vibrating when it auto-corrects a word, plus other more detailed options. I thoroughly appreciate the exceptionally logical organization of the software. Also, I called BlackBerry to get assistance with a few items of interest to me, and you know what...they were extremely kind and professional on the phone, and never rushed through an issue. Naturally, the service was free, as well. I should mention that there is also a virtual assistant called BlackBerry Assistant, and it surely works just fine. I've got to give the assistant a bigger workout on their map / driving program, but I've had no trouble so far. If I ask for a place by name, it pulls up the directions and takes me. If I specify the address, it does the same. The screen is also easy to see. If I ask what 2,349 multiplied by 155 is, it also answers, etc. Ditto Internet searches. If apps and gaming are your thing, this phone may or may not be your first choice. But if reliability and software performance are relevant to you, then it is definitely your first choice. Last, but not least, is sound quality. I mentioned it in passing, but let me be clear: IT IS SUPERIOR. On speaker, most callers don't realize that I am, in fact, on speaker. It's got four microphones, I understand. And sound is loud. You've bascially got stereo speakers, and you can surely turn ‘em up to quite a loud level. You'll need to familiarize yourself with settings and get your phone customized...but it's well worth it. Seriously, I'm going to buy one or two back-up BlackBerry Passports. Oh, yeah, speaking of backups, backing up the phone is no problem with free software, but it is slightly different than Apple, and one should make sure they understand the differences; basically, it seems you can save your content, but, my experience suggests that you may need to re-download apps. In sum, at this time, I would not be interested in another phone, and my significant other loves her BlackBerry Classic. Oh, I did forget to mention that the keyboard is unique in many ways, but one such way is that it is also a track pad / scrolling device that allows you, by just sweeping your finger, to go from left to right or up and down on the screen and / or document. There's plenty more, but I'm hopeful that you'll take a chance on this device, if it sounds right for you. There are plenty of videos on YouTube, too. Not all are actually helpful. ""Experts"" from magazines or others who have just taken it out of the box really don't make as meaningful contributions to understanding the device, in my opinion. In sum, I don't think this phone is trying to impress everyone or was even conceived as a device that would seriously compete with the iPhone's customer base; however, more serious people are surely taking notice. As to security, I'm no expert, but, leaders in the public and private sectors clearly prefer BlackBerry for its security. While I'm not presently a high-powered CEO, and merely head up only a small energy firm + my own family, this device has earned my great respect (and my significant other feels the same about her BlackBerry Classic). We've been using our devices for about two months and it's a real pleasure to come back to BlackBerry, for me, and, for her, to enjoy a BlackBerry product / software for the first time. Written in great haste.",2015年5月2日 在美国审核
Blackberry is back in the game!,"In the past few years I've used many phones.I admit it.... I'm somewhat of a phone geek. From several versions of Android phones to every version of iPhone (except the iPhone 6 and 6+)I've always liked Blackberry due to the physical keyboard it used to have and because OS10 works for me on my Z10 and Z30.But I started to feel that Blackberry was starting to become just another touch screen phone that looked and felt like the rest.The Passport changed all of that.This phone is what Blackberry should have come out with a few years ago when it was being kicked to the curb by many.It has an incredible keyboard that looks odd and makes you wonder if you can use it after typing on a screen for so long but it is unlike any other keyboard in that it surprisingly took zero time to get used to it.The square size poses no problems for me.It fits just fine in my rear pants pocket and feels just fine when holding it.As a matter of fact, it is easier to use because of it's odd shape.Of course it isn't really a one-handed type of phone if you have smallish hands.My hands are average and I've always used two hands when typing or dialing on a cell phone so for me the whole ""not a phone you can use one handed"" is a moot point.The build quality is like all other Blackberry phones.Top notch.You can feel a heft but not enough to make you wish it was lighter.The OS is slick, fast and incredibly responsive to any command I give it. The battery has to be the best out there.I charge my phone over night and unplug it at around 7 a.m. every morning.I make a lot of calls and text quite a bit throughout the day. it still has 75% battery power at the end of my day, which is around 10-11 p.m..And I used to be impressed with having 40% power left on my iPhone 5s!The whole package is just right for me.Easy to use, well balanced, comfortable and good looking.If you are looking for something new, with a touch of vintage that the keyboard gives it, and an incredible OS that is seamless and predictably easy to master, go for the Passport.The only negative is that there are not too many accessories available for it.",2014年11月26日 在美国审核

"Best, most intelligent phone I've owned","This isn't a phone, it's an expertly designed mini-computer.The OS, keyboard and hardware blend together exceptionally well and form an experience that no other smartphone manufacturer can match.Everything is embellished and improved by how well the OS, keyboard and hardware work together. Email, messaging, browsing, even making music playlists. Every app that ships with this phone is better than the apps on competing smartphones, from the browser (full, modern Webkit, for those wondering) to the email client to the music app. Speaking as a software programmer by trade, I have never experienced such an excellent user experience spanning a mobile OS before.Coupled with the amazingly usable and productive user experience on the phone, the keyboard makes everything better. Its touch capacity allows for gestures and scrolling too, which work really well.It's completely obvious to me that big-name reviewers are speaking from a point of bias towards the current trend in smartphones, and fail to recognize how this unique device truly shines if evaluated independently on its own merit. The press is reviewing the Passport by comparing it to iPhone and Android devices. While other smartphones are also great, this does a disservice to this unique device which can only be evaluated on its own grounds.If you're a professional who wants a mobile device that helps get things done, this is your best bet. Blackberry was pushed into a corner and responded with a truly innovative device. The experience and expertise that went into making this thing is brimming and obvious.However, you may not like this phone if productivity isn't your focus. If you're more of a selfie-taker, photographer, or mobile gamer, the Passport was not made for you. You may also want to avoid Blackberry if you depend on a populated app store. The app store is mediocre; however, the apps that ship with the device, which include Twitter and Facebook, are beyond exceptional.",2014年12月8日 在美国审核

Stunning Phone for an Academician !,"A bit of background. I'm a physicist and do a lot of reading! This phone fit perfectly based on my requirements. So I was looking into a phone which- had a qwerty keypad: I have used touchscreen phones in the past but nothing can beat the accuracy of a physical qwerty keypad. So useful for emails! Now I can type full emails without even worrying about making a single autocorrect mistake (you never know what the autocorrect might lead u into. Good for online jokes not good when u are sending an email to hundreds of students!!)- 60 characters per line: so much better to read papers/articles/emails/online. Is so much more clear than traditional phone screens. Note that I loved it cause it's ""awesome"" for reading purposes; look somewhere else if u mainly use ur phone for watching videos/playing games then this isn't for you.- I bought the Silver Edition. This phone feels so well built and sturdy! Much more heft and sturdier than iphones and most android phones I have used. This has to do with them usingsolid steel rather than aluminium.- battery life is great: easily lasts slightly more than a day- Camera is competitive. While not the best around you can still use those 16 mega pixels to take some pretty sick pictures!- trackpad aka the keyboard. This has to be one of the best things to come out in a phone for a very long time!! I can read things and scroll without touching the screen! Say what!

After years of using screen keyboard, this keyboard feels like home. Fact that it can be a trackpad at the same time, need some adjusting, but once you master it, it is awesome. HUB, just brilliant and OS as a whole brings home more goodies. BlackBerry Blend is more than a gimmick, it is well thought productivity addition.

Amazing BlackBerry smartphone!,"Hands down the most capable, longest lasting, secure, reliable and toughest smartphone I ever owned. I started with a Nokia 2190 back in '96 and have owned several dozen phones since. Nothing and I mean nothing comes even close to this powerhouse of a BlackBerry. Very bright and sharp display which reads perfectly even on the brightest days outdoors or indoors.Powerful quad processors allow me to work on excel, word, email and search the Internet all at once while background playing my favorite tunes on Pandora through the Passport's insanely crisp and loud dual high fidelity speakers. Just about every app us business pros could ever need is available through either Amazon App Store or BlackBerry World or through the several other side-loading app stores available for the BB10 OS. Emails, texts, mms, videos, all run flawlessly...please do yourself a big favor and ignore the 'Angry Birds' playing kiddies' ignorant reviews about this great phone. While it has an unconventional size (yes I was hesitant at first but I'd figured if I didn't like it I'd simply return it) but in the end it turned out to be the best decision I ever made regarding this very high-quality (stainless steel frame and Gorilla Glass 3) smartphone. Yes in case you must...it plays all the games you want without issues on it. I played several just to shut my coworker up and he was stunned how much better and smoother my graphics ran compared to his overpriced apple phone (had three of them so spare me the fanboy speeches please, each was but a overpriced great-looking POS!). The battery lasts nearly two full days....and mine is fully encrypted which uses extra juice!Bottom line is this...You will NOT find a higher quality, more capable, longer lasting, and superbly business AND consumer friendly smartphone for anywhere near $499! You have nothing to lose by giving it a try with an open mind like anyadult would. If you care about being productive and accessible on the go...this is it!Reception is superb, the browser is literally the FASTEST of any smartphone on the market! It blitzes through even the most graphic intensive sites with ease. Quick settings, drop down menus, notifications, etc. are all very well laid out and thought out. The BlackBerry Blend feature is simply priceless!Look, honestly folks...haters (especially those who never owned this phone or ever worked on it for a few days) will always 'trash talk' any BlackBerry...but after owning 3x iphones, 4x androids, and 2x windows phones (amongst many others!) I do not want anything but my BB10 Passport!

I am impressed.,"I am incredibly impressed with the device.The build quality is remarkable. This thing feels indestructible. I love squeezing the steel sizes, they're so ridiculously sturdy. The device is hefty but not heavy. Definitely not top-heavy despite some claims. The keyboard felt surprisingly natural to me immediately when I started using it. I might hit the ""N"" key instead of the ""M"" key here and there but that's a small adjustment. I use the keyboard trackpad all the time.The screen itself is sharp, crisp, and smooth. Very smooth to the touch, much like the Nexus 4. The brightness is awesome too. You can crank that sucker up and the outdoor visibility is the best I've seen yet. The 1x1 aspect ratio felt completely fine to me as I used a Q10 previously (although I came directly from the Nexus 5) but the real estate is awesome. Despite not having big hands I don't have trouble with one-hand use. Obviously typing requires two-hands but I can reach all corners with my one thumb.Call quality is great for me. The microphones record my voice loud and crisp in my tests and the speakers are impressively loud (especially compared to the Nexus 5).The camera does a pretty good job. It does have issues with focusing, though. The shutter is fast and images are sharp but that doesn't matter if your subject is blurry. It's not terrible but it's noticeable. I'm sure this can and will be fixed in a software update. Video recording has been great to me as well. I tested out the 1080p at 60fps, its good stuff.The battery life has been great. Easily lasts me a full day with heavy use. I usually end the day with 40-50% and that's with a lot of playing. Look at it this way:I experimented with some heavy use. Lot's of android app fiddling and streaming on twitch for about 45-1 hour. Passport went from 100% to 85%. The Q10 would have dropped to ~70% and the Nexus 5 60-65% in my experience.Remember that was with some pretty messy toying around. The Passport was still at 47% by the end of that [long] day. (8:30am-1am)I am a fan of BB10 OS. I loaded up 10.3 on my Q10 and the Passport comes with it out of the box. It's much more aesthetic and functional than 10.2. Everything is very fast. I love the browser, very speedy. Personal assistant is great but is a bit slow. The one thing I do love about Android more than anything is Google Now, but I'll manage. Every in BB10 just works. It all feels stable. I've had no crashes or slowdowns. When I want to play a video in the browser it plays, I don't have to refresh the page a few times or close and re-open the app.Android apps have been working very well. I sideloaded Snap to get apps that aren't in the Amazon app store.Some have scaling issues, mostly games. Everything has been smooth though. Google maps, netflix, instagram, twitch, etc. I really like the native BB10 apps that are available. Facebook and Twitter have great integration with the hub.-Let me just add that this phone has MicroSd support. I freakin' love that. Big plus for me as I kinda hate streaming music.This is an awesome phone. Everything feels premium. However, if you're a heavy app person, you'll probably want to avoid the extra work of getting things set up. An Android or iPhone will be better for you. In every day stuff, I just want a phone that works. A phone that's stable and doesn't feel like corners were cut.I am impressed.",2014年11月4日 在美国审核

Great phone so far,"I've had the phone about a week.At first it felt huge, still feels a bit big and is difficult to use with one hand.If you've never used the Blackberry 10 OS, there is a bit of a learning curve due to the gestures.Sideloading Snap is a must in order to be able to install some Android apps that aren't in the amazon store.There are still a few apps - like Viber, along with anything that uses Google Play services that have issues running with the current OS (10.3.0.908)The keyboard is taking some getting used to but I am learning to like it.I was using a Bold 9900 previously. It's nice to see that BIS is gone and ActiveSync is used instead.As a result, the browser is much faster and e-mails seem to show up quicker as well.Call quality, especially using speakerphone is a big improvement over the Bold 9900.So far battery life has been great - I've been getting about 1.5-2 days on a charge.One thing I didn't like, that it is easy to overlook is that some applications are able to edit your contact list.I overlooked this when first starting LinkedIn (included with the phone, but able to be deleted) Upon signing in, it automatically merged all of my linkedIn contacts with the phone contacts.Once they were merged, there was no way to un-merge the contacts except to re-import them from another phone.Permissions can't natively be controlled for any Android applications that are installed, although there is an application - ""permission manager app ops"" that enables permissions of android applications to be controlled.",2014年11月25日 在美国审核
This phone is the best productivity phone money can buy.,"This is, by far, the best phone I have ever owned...and I have owned quite a few! Windows phones, several Androids, and some older Blackberry phones. Its screen is large and gorgeous. The keyboard is somewhat larger and more satisfying than previous Blackberry keyboards. And the OS has been refined and runs smoothly. Most Android apps will work on this phone as well. The battery life is epic, lasting well over a day with normal use. The camera takes unbelievably clear pictures, and I rarely use the flash because, even in low light, the pics come out great leaving the flash off.I will admit, one of the best things about it is that it turns heads. The steel casing, the wide screen, and the keyboard all get people's attention. You will inevitably get people asking about your device and what it is. People ask everywhere I go.Finally, I have been the most productive on this phone. Previously, I didn't particularly enjoy using a touch screen keyboard, so if I needed to respond to an email with a few sentences, I would wait until I could get to a computer. With the Passport, I don't have that hesitation, and enjoy using the keyboard to type out messages quickly and accurately.This is a fantastic phone. Those of you who have had Blackberry phones before, and miss the reliability and keyboard, will feel like the shackles have been removed once you try one of these.",2016年1月26日 在美国审核
Love this phone!,"The Pros1. Great battery--I get 2 days with light use. (Downside: the big battery makes the phone heavier than those with a shorter battery life.)2. First time with a physical keyboard: this version of the Passport is balanced perfectly for keyboard typing with 2 hands; love the physical keyboard regarding typing without looking although it does take a little more effort to press versus touching a virtual keyboard.3. Love ability to one-touch a keyboard letter to get to contacts or whatever else I want to pop up instantly.4. Beautiful, bright screen5. Believe sound is coming from several speakers--the sound can't be beat.6. The Hub is great - one place for all notifications or you can pick and choose what you wish to appear. And your events/tasksfrom your calendar are at the top, fast and efficient.7. Browser is fast.8. BB apps are well-integrated/work well together. Particular apps are really good. Especially like bedside mode, and contact managment is also great. It can store any and all information I'd like.9. Large screen is wonderful: easy to read for web browsing; apps aren't always needed as you can use the mobile website.10. Great for privacy: BB apps list detailed permissions and each permission can be turned off/on11. The phone itself is simply beautiful to look at.12. Lots of efficiency built in: Long-pressing caps the letter when typing, apps are closed by a single swipe and touch gesture, moving around the phone by simple swiping versus messing with buttons and waiting, etc. (I find android phones more awkward to use.)13. Malware problem is non-existant. The phone is very secure and can't be jailbroken.14. Blackberry Blend: integrates your smartphone and computer without a security issue.15. Lots of storage: you can remove/add SD cards16. Voice quality is very good.17. The keyboard can also be used as the scroll bar. Allows for faster scrolling than I can do if I have to run my finger up and down the screen.18. Build quality is great (The first edition -not the silver-had a lift issue for some. This does not.)19. If you want to look at/work with documents, this is the phone for you.Cons: Lack of easy access to all the apps you might like1. While you can load Android apps, you can't do it through Blackberry World and it requires some playing around to set up a download path to android apps. Some Android apps won't work well2. Blackberry World: a few of the BB apps available for earlier phones such as the Z30, Z10, etc. are missing.3. This is a wider phone, not a slim grip, but that's the price paid for a screen that makes web browsing easy. I have small hands and type by holding the phone at the bottom with two hands and can type quickly that way as the phone is balanced well. If you try to type with only one finger and one-handed grip with small hands, you may not be as happy.",2015年12月24日 在美国审核

"It works seamlessly with work related apps like Linkedin, and it syncs with Outlook","I am a former Blackberry user who has been using a Droid phone for my business phone for several years.I switched to this phone for a reason.It works seamlessly with work related apps like Linkedin, and it syncs with Outlook.If you are a Droid user, don't write a review of a Blackberry by saying it doesn't work as well as a Droid.That is merely the same as an iPhone user saying a Droid does not work as well as an iPhone.It is like comparing ""Apples to oranges"" (sorry for the pun).All operating systems for wireless devices have their issues.The fact is that the Blackberry has the fewest issues in terms of not working during certain operations.It just plain works, and it works very well. I own a Windows Nokia phone for personal use, and many don't like those, but many such as myself like it.So for comparison, you have to consider whether the phone fits your intended use.Blackberry excels at making a phone that is easy to use and has no glitches in how it is used. No hangs, no crashes like the Droid system.It is not for someone who wants to download a bunch of shopping apps or games, etc.If you want to download gazillions of apps, then try a Droid or Windows phone or an iPhone.Another review described the Blackberry as a ""real phone"", not a toy phone like a Droid. That may be the best way to describe it.There was an old Verizon commercial on TV with James Earl Jones doing the audio, saying ""At Verizon.... we mean business!"".Well, this phrase definitely fits the descriptor for Blackberry.It has the most secure wireless transmission/reception protocol, the phone does not hang or crash while using features or surf the web, it is very easy to use with your hands,and if you use this for work, email, communications, it is the best product on the market with no close second place finisher.",2015年6月17日 在美国审核
Excellent and finely tuned version of the BlackBerry Passport!,"I upgraded to this phone from the ATT Passport, which i loved! But after seeing this thing of beauty, it was time to say bye to the original Passport. Sold fairly quickly, i went and purchased this sexy beast of a machine, and wow. This just screams quality, and when you get it in your hands, you can feel you are holding solidly built device. Which is always why i have loved BlackBerry, not only for their physical keyboards, but for the quality of the devices they have pushed out, and they only get better! I have used this phone for about two months, so hear are my ratings.Unboxing/First Impression:This is one of the most premium devices i have ever owned! It looks and feels so solid, and the form is so sleek and elegant.Hardware: 5/5This thing is built like a German car. Its just a really nice solid looking device. The keyboard has been refined and types smoother than the previous Passports. It is lightning fast, and the camera is solid as well. The screen resolution is also nice and vivid.Battery: 5/5This thing has great battery life! I usually unplug it 6am, and lasts all day with moderate use, by the time i get home, which is around 3/ 4pm the battery life will still be around 70%.OS/Apps: 4/5The BB10 has evolved so much since its debut, and now on 10.3 this thing runs sooo smooth and so fast. Love it. However the Apps dept is still lacking, but new BlackBerry Priv on the rise,powered by Android, but made by BlackBerry will solve that app problem, and will hopefully do well with the public! I know i will be purchasing one, once its released!Overall: 5/5This phone is absolutely excellent for me! It has everything I need, easy to navigate, and does whatever i need it do, instantly. Thank you BlackBerry for creating such a great device and OS, that i truly enjoy using every single time swipe up to wake up the phone!",2015年10月7日 在美国审核

"All your comms in the palm of your hands, pushed to one location!","Long time blackberry user here; as well as an Apple fanatic. Last phones I've owned are the Iphone 4s and the Blackberry Q10. To start, I've since upgraded the 4S to the new Iphone 6 (the 5 was a joke, which is why I passed on it) and of course I just recently purchased the Passport as well. Well, why would anyone in their right mind want to own two different phones? Read on.For the professionals who are always on the move and need to get things done. The Passport is for you. Here, email and everything communication is God. Blackberry Hub, I'm looking at you. That's right, it pulls all your communications into one central location to read. Facebook, emails, text, BBM, Linkedin, software updates, etc. You name it, it could probably be pushed to your Hub. Granted Blackberry doesn't have the greatest app titles around but the Amazon App 'slightly' makes up for this shortfall, but not entirely. Again, this phone is for people that live and thrive on email communications and the like. It also does a few other great things like Blackberry Blend which is essentially your PHONE on a PC or MAC. What this translates to is if you're on your computer you'll have access to EVERYTHING that pops up on your phone, with the exception of trying to run the installed apps of course.The new physical keyboard takes a few minutes to get used to but once you understand how it works in conjunction with the screen then you'll understand how amazing it is. Say good bye to embarrassing auto corrects that you frequently get on an all touch phone. You won't get those here. For those complaining about speed differences between an actual keyboard and touch screen, all I have to ask is this: What are you writing? A freaking 10 page report?! It doesn't matter how fast. Short text messages and email responses work just fine and that's what most people write anyways.So if the Passport is so great, why do I need to keep an Iphone around? Well I'm a huge music fan. And this just happens to be the one field where all previous Blackberrys have failed at. Their music software just isn't as great as Itunes for music management. Plus the new 6 just has a few new features which I wanted to test (Apple Pay, etc). I could go on about the Iphone but this isn't a review for that.So if I had to choose the one phone I needed to carry around, I'd stick to the Passport. It just screams productivity for users that need to get things done (24+ hour work horse if you're not actively draining it by 'passing' time). For those that want to carry a phone to have something to 'do' to pass the time (social media, youtube, etc) then this Phone is not for you simply because the screen is designed for getting work done and not watching videos/movies in your spare time. The Passport displays everything crisp. Text on this phone is your best friend. Plus the phone is just a big sexy beast of a machine.To end this review I'd like to say one final thing. Ignore the pundits/critics that cry and downgrade the Passport because of its unusual size. These are the same people who gave phones like the Galaxy Note and 6 Plus amazing scores, even though they too, are super sized and require two hands to operate. They're just not used to 'change' and are stuck to iOS/Android but don't want to admit it. There, I said it.In the end, it's a good thing life gives us all choices. This is one of them.",2014年12月13日 在美国审核

"Weird design, but great screen, excellent physical keyboard and responsiveness.","Had a try a few months ago at a Classic (Q20) Blackberry device and fell in love with it. I really like physical keyboards so the Classic was a first option. But I've grown accustomed to bigger screens so the Classic there was a fail as well as the weight for a ""smaller"" device. Decided then to try the Passport and what can I say, I absolutely like it. Just three rows of the physical keyboard but with the touch controls built in + the extra touch screen characters, one gets used to it fast. The bigger and weirdo screen is also excellent. Battery life is superb and Android support is a bit better since this device is faster than the Classic. OS10 has really excellent ideas. Love the swipes, love the Blackberry Hub. I was pleasantly surprised by this device. Having owned Symbian, Androids, MeeGo, Windows devices, I wasn't expecting the responsiveness and usefulness of OS10.Why remove a Star?Blackberry seems to be pushing to Android now with the Priv and it's kind of letting go of OS10. Reminds me of my dearest Nokia with their MeeGo and Symbian tries... :(Also, software support IS A JOKE! Facebook app is now basically a web portal. Same for Youtube. Whatsapp is getting phased out at the end of the year and software alternatives are not really good. The Blackberry store sucks even more than the Windows Store! That was surprising to me.Anyway, I'm not too much of a power user nor hungry for apps kind of guy so, I will keep using it until it dies probably... yeah that's how much I like it! But, I'm weird... :p",2016年3月30日 在美国审核
Fabulous phone!!,"What a great phone!! I bought this to use as a business phone and it is great. I communicate mostly by emails and as they are very technical these can be quite lengthy. The QWERTY keyboard is large enough for my fingers to hit the right key only and the large screen allows me to see what I have already written and helps me keep my information precise and on task.The additional Arabic on the keyboard will no doubt come in useful with Middle East customers. The red is really pretty, I bought a black and red case also from Amazon and the Passport fits perfectly in it. The phone has all the great BlackBerry features, notably the Hub, so I am sure this phone will work well for me.I can't wait to view spreadsheets on it, this is everything I hoped it would be in a business phone.",2017年12月29日 在美国审核

A truly impressive device,"I am extremely impressed with the capabilities of this device and the thoughtfulness and coherence of the BlackBerry 10 operating system. I've had the Passport now for a couple of months, and recently received the 10.3.1 OS update, which added a ton of cool new elements, including emergency battery saving mode. I've stumbled across a number of other features, though I'm not sure if they are new or not, like ""advanced interaction"" which does stuff like silence or shut off screen when the device is flipped over (also I'll note the universal search is amazing ... for example I couldn't remember the term ""advanced interaction"" but I just typed in ""flip"" on the home screen and, among the results, was ""advanced interactions"" in settings). I also recently discovered the keyboard shortcuts, you can assign an app or a bunch of other actions to the long press of any key. It would take too long, and frankly I don't remember off hand, all the pleasant little surprises the OS and the device offer, but it's pretty cool.I will say I saw one review complaining about the combo virtual and hard keyboard. I'll say I think the arrangement is genius (how does one complain about a partially virtual keyboard but embrace a fully virtual one? Makes no sense). Anyway, you need to realize that the keyboard is touch sensitive. So, a back swipe = ""backspace"". And a down swipe = shift. Further, though the virtual keyboard appears when you swipe down (shift), you don't actually need to use it: When you ""shift"" you can then press the hard key corresponding with the soft key, so for example, swipe down then press the ""m"" key and you'll get a dollar sign. Though the secondary character isn't printed on the hard key, it works exactly as you'd expect a keyboard with the shift key pressed to operate. Finally, a swipe up selects the predictive text word being suggested for you (there are three presented just above the keyboard, left, right and middle). Once you become accustomed to using the shift key to get your symbols (like speed typing you remember that shift-""b"" is ""@"" and shift ""h"" is ""&amp;"" etc, though you can also see it when the virtual keyboard pops up), and begin to rely on the predictive text swipe up, and the really high quality hard keyboard, you can beaver out messages dramatically faster than any other input device.Virtual Assistant: Unlike predecessor BlackBerrys, the voice command system works really well. I haven't done side-by-side tests, but I ask it to do stuff like set alarms and find things on teh web or the device and it performs very well.Blend: This is one that seems to have been overlooked by a lot of people. You install the app on your computer or tablet, and then basically it gives you access to all the messaging, calendar and contact functions of your phone right on your desktop. So, get to the office, pop the Passport on to a cradle (fyi battery life is very good, I often forget to charge at night and I'm still OK for the better part of the next day, which is a relief from battery anxiety I've had with all previous phones), and respond to SMS, email, BBM from my computer; it also shows your contacts and calendar. It doesn't show Notes which is a shame that I assume will be addressed in a future update. It also doesn't let you edit your contacts. But it is Gen 1, and quite a remarkable tool. Also they say nothing is saved on the second device; just the display and input of the second device are used, so Blend could be used on any random computer without worrying your data is going to be left behind for someone else to come across.Anyway, I've seen a lot of reviews where the user seemed to have no idea how to make use of the capabilities of the device (I'm not surprised, I just happened to stumble on this function, there are a lot of hidden gems really, maybe I should read the manual). Oh, the photos are really great quality, even my friends with iPhones have to admit. I just noticed a couple of weeks ago that in the Photo Album app, if you click on the occasional banner that separates sets of photos and videos, it automatically creates a slide show of videos and photos taken in some coherent period of time, with a variety of transitions, etc, it adds some music and a little intro cover and closing. I'm really impressed with this, as what a cool way to show your vacation pics without the dull flipping from one pic to the next. And no effort on my part at all (this is called ""Automatic Story Maker""; there is a ""Story Maker"" app too which allows you to select the media, the intro, the music, etc but I haven't spend time fussing with all that, so I like the automatic mode).I've had good luck with Android apps on the Passport. There are a bunch of Android app stores you can install directly from the browser on the device (the browser is REALLY fast) like 1 Mobile Market and Aptoide and APK DL and Vshare and Mobogenie, so you are not limited to Amazon App Store. I strongly encourage people to install this app called ""Snap"" which is a native app like Google Play Store. Snap must be side-loaded (a 1-time thing), which is about a 5-10 minute process, there are lots of guides how to do it (basically put the device into Dev mode and install an extension on Chrome browser of your computer). I put on Google Maps (there's an apk on the web you can install to address the sign on issue), yelp, snapchap, instagram, paypal, Shazam, Airbnb, several off-line maps apps, and a bunch of other ones I actually never use.Uber has a mobile site m.uber.com which works just like the app. Is the Android emulation absolutely foolproof? No, you'll occasionally see some message about Google Play Services or something, but I'm really happy with it. I think of it like this: It's a small compromise to pay for access to a mobile powerhouse of features no other device offers and that I really need and use and rely on. And anyway I have an android tablet where I've downloaded hundreds of apps I never use, but maybe that gives me psychic comfort I don't know.Finally, I'll note the dramatic improvement just in the OS update from 10.3 to 10.3.1; the OS isn't perfect but is constantly being polished and improved.",2015年3月12日 在美国审核

Passport is king,"*typing this review on my new Passport*I was a BlackBerry loyalist (started with a Torch 9800 in college, upgraded to a 9900, Z10.) The Z10 was stolen so I needed to replace it. I listened to my friends and bought an LG G3. Pros: awesome screen, good battery life, loud speaker, flexible OS. Excellent camera. Cons: awful keyboard. Poor corporate email experience. Did I mention the awful keyboard?Got fed up with autocorrect and ordered the Passport from Amazon. Fast delivery.Tip: phone requires a nano SIM. My local ATT store hooked me up for free (the G3 takes a micro SIM.)First impressions: wonderful OS (smooth, fluid, no lags, intuitive gestures.) Screen is very bright and sharp. Battery life is best in class. Keyboard is awesome (although the virtual part takes some getting used to.) Same goes for the wide form factor--after two days it feels completely natural. Camera is ""good"" (G3 is much better.)The ""professional"" reviewers didn't do the Passport justice (read REAL reviews on Amazon.) if you're considering this phone, buy it.

My First Blackberry,"I am a first time Blackberry customer, and I'll spend the rest of this review gushing over a phone that most people will never even think about buying. To give a little background on my knowledge of phones, I have owned iPhones before (4+5), I own several Windows phones, and I also own a few flagship Android devices as well. I have used this device for about 2 weeks now, and I'm probably more intrigued with it now than when I first purchased it. I am not going to talk about the specs or anything like that as you already know about those.I think what makes this phone extremely viable as my daily driver is the ability to run android apps. With a very small amount of tweaking, I was able to install Google Play store, Google Maps, and use my Google account to download new apps and all the apps I already purchased. I read reviews that try to attack it's ability to run Android apps, but I've only had 2 out of approx 25 apps I've tried that do not work. The other run flawlessly and look fantastic.The BB10 OS is solid. Compared to iOS, Windows Phone, and Android, it relies heavily on swiping instead of a dedicated home key. I found the switch generally easy; however, there is a bit of a learning curve and reward. It took longer to learn than other switches I've done, but it has many more nuanced features that allow for greater productivity. I think it's easier to multitask and switch between apps on BB10 than other phone OS i've tried. Also keep in mind the physical keyboard allows for key specific shortcuts. In Twitter for example, I can press R to refresh or T to snap to the top.The call quality and speaker phone are better than any other phone I've used before. The screen is easier to read. The keyboard is easier to type. The battery lasts WAY longer than any other phone I've tried. The OS allows for faster/better multitasking. The notification LED light is fantastic. It fits absolutely fine in any pants I've worn (albeit leaving a nice square protrusion).My one negative is the obvious-- you really can't use this phone very well with one hand. The bluetooth connectivity in my car has worked so well that this has never been an issue for me. *Update-- After posting this I did think of another minor negative--there are very few cases and screen protectors for this device. The screen is curved/tapered at the edges, and many reviews and forums state that the glass screen protectors don't stick or are cut very small to avoid the curves.To wrap up my review, this is the best phone I've ever used (for two weeks). The OS is a fantastic surprise, and I didn't feel stranded like on Windows phone as all my android apps were available. When I read news articles on this phone, I would always see some comments hating on Blackberry or calling this phone ridiculous. I know the internet is full of trolls and ignored those anyway, but what is clear to me now is that anyone talking negatively about this phone simply hasn't used it. It really is that simple.",2015年6月12日 在美国审核

"Good phone overall, but didn't suit my needs. YMMV.","I was in the market for a new phone sometime last fall, and I started to feel my HTC M8 was growing long in the tooth. Feeling the M9 wasn't worth the upgrade, I decided to look for something entirely different than what I've tried before. I've used Android the most by far, although at some points I had a Lumia phone with Windows Phone 8 and an iPad Air. I've been around the block when it comes to the mobile operating systems, and I decided I wanted to give BlackBerry OS a real, fair shot.When I first found out about what BlackBerry was doing, I found myself very impressed by the Classic. I loved its form factor and the fact that it could close the gap for any Android apps I might miss. Despite that, the specs didn't look so good compared to the Passport. I wanted a device that could run Android apps just fine with minimal issues, and the specs in the Passport looked a lot better than the Classic's. That in mind, I thought it over for several days and decided it was time to finally upgrade. I placed my order for a Passport and it arrived at my house soon enough.I got the phone ready for use with my Cricket SIM and my 128GB SD card (both worked perfectly) and installed several huge updates before I could really get started. Despite that, BlackBerry OS impressed me, at least for the most part (I'll go over what didn't soon enough). I loved BlackBerry Hub, for instance. Being able to see my emails, scheduled events, and messages all in one place was a nice feature. I even already used BBM on my Android phone to chat with a few select friends away from SMS, so it was even nicer to have a phone with it already included and supported in Hub. I got Android apps running on it and found pretty much whatever app I wanted to run, although some apps didn't look quite right because of the screen size being a perfect square. For that, BlackBerry was at least nice enough to include display options to decide whether you want the app to display in its native ratio or to stretch and fill the screen, so I do give them points for doing their best. The device comes with the Amazon App Store, although last I checked, there were ways to get Google Play working on the device in case the Amazon App Store lacked a couple of critical apps you really need. In my case, my mobile banking app was available on Google Play, but not the Amazon App Store. If you needed it from Android, you could more than likely run it on the Passport. I recalled using Spotify on the device, for instance, and it looked quite good.But the software wasn't exactly the thing that drew me to get the Passport in the first place. What I was more interested in was the physical hardware, and I believe this is where BlackBerry shines above and beyond so many phone manufacturers. They know how to design phones that, when you really have a chance to hold them, feel extremely premium. I used to have a BlackBerry Playbook a long time ago, and despite the poorly supported software, the way it felt to physically hold it was so beautiful that I had a hard time letting go of it. The Passport is no exception to the remarkable design language choices that BlackBerry makes. When you hold it, you feel like you're holding something so nice. The size isn't even that bad for carrying in your pocket, especially compared to some of the many Galaxy Note phones that appeal to people looking for larger and larger phones. I compared the surface size, and it indeed did fit on top of my travel passport.Unfortunately, the wonderful physical design wasn't really enough to make me keep this phone. I had a handful of deal breakers that pertained mostly to me when I got to really try this phone long enough. For instance, you really need BlackBerry Blend on your desktop computer to unleash your phone's full potential. After installing Blend, I had various stability problems on Windows 10. My computer would not shut down completely when I hit shut down, or I would have severe stalling or freezing when trying to do whatever I normally try to do on my system. My PC is reasonably powerful with an octo-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and a GTX 760. My PC also ran far smoother once I completely removed Blend from my system, so I know my hardware was not the issue.I had a more specific problem with the device regarding its bluetooth connectivity. When I connected my LG HBS 730 to the device, I found my volume was way too loud to listen to comfortably, even when I set the volume as low as I could on the headphones. Using the phone's volume controls was too uneven for my liking as well, having the phone go from muted with zero volume to still being far too loud with a single press of extra volume. I looked up the problem and something like this had happened on Android and iOS versions apparently not properly supporting all bluetooth audio devices at some point. I recalled actually having the same issue when I upgraded to Lollipop for the first time on my HTC M8, but Google released an update sooner or later that patched it up and made audio sound normal. I checked for updates on my Passport, but found nothing that would fix this, and my options on trying to find a workaround were extremely limited to nonexistent.The third deal breaker I had with the device was, sadly, its keyboard. I was hoping that the experience would have been more like when I got a chance to use the Classic. That keyboard was perfect, but the Passport had to change the design of it to suit the dimensions and design they were looking for. The keyboard has a touch sensor underneath it to help with additional features and gestures, like scrolling without having to touch your screen. While I did like that feature and how tactile the keys felt to touch, the little details BlackBerry tried to add to the keyboard's features made it a nightmare for me to use. Looking at the front of the device, you'll see these silver, horizontal lines between the keys on the BlackBerry. These are the ""frets"" that are signature to BlackBerry's keyboard design, and you can physically use these to help your thumbs move to the right keys.I do like the signature frets and the physical keyboard, but since the keyboard has touch features underneath it, I would oftentimes find myself making mistakes while typing. The bottom of the touch screen tries to show you suggested words based on what letters you type, and depending on what part of the keyboard you swipe up on determines which word you select to autocomplete. There were so many instances when I would type and accidentally autocomplete a word when the reality is my suggested word hadn't shown up at all and I was busy trying to type the entire thing out. The keyboard also utilizes the bottom of the screen to give you a digital number row when you want to input numbers. I guess they had to work with this shortcoming since there was no space for numbers on the keyboard. However, I'm sure there were settings I could adjust on the touch features and all these other small things. I'm aware of that. But what really sold me against wanting to use the keyboard ever again was how tiny the spacebar was. No matter how hard I tried, I could not get used to how frustrating it was trying to hit the tiny spacebar on this device. It was this design decision that made me wish that BlackBerry had updated the internals of the BlackBerry Classic and released it alongside the Passport. I would have gotten that phone instead, despite the smaller screen size.These deal breakers in mind for me, I packed the phone back up and returned it. I've never had anything against BlackBerry, and I do want them to succeed as a smartphone OEM, but I felt that the Passport, for my needs at least, was a real miss. As I said, my ideal BlackBerry OS phone probably would have been a BlackBerry Classic with the Passport's internals. If I hadn't already purchased a different phone since then, I more than likely would have looked into the BlackBerry Priv, but I haven't had the chance to try that phone, so I can't really say anything about it.",2015年9月2日 在美国审核

Only caveat is its size,"This is the best device i have ever used. The best.My only complaints are in its lack of a native printing app, which is downright criminal, and a rather poor app ecosystem. If you install a Google Play Store client (there are a few options), you can take advantage of the Android runtime built into BB10 to open a much larger variety of apps. The main apps i use for work/productivity are all from the BlackBerry World app store and are all native apps, too. My only Android apps are all games and multimedia-related. The Passport's extra horsepower gives it the oomph to do this without trouble as compared to the Classic (which does fine, but the Passport truly shines in the performance department).The display is crystal clear with its 1440x1440 resolution and you have to try really hard to see pixels.The loudspeakers are just that - LOUD. The only complaint here for me is the lower volumes are too low, so the progression from very quiet to very loud happens very abruptly. The sound quality at full-blast is very good, with no discernible distortion.The capacitive keyboard is very handy for scrolling and zooming, but i wish there was a way to use it as a trackpad like any toolbelt-having BlackBerry.The typing experience is extrordinary - i could use this keyboard comfortably all day.If you haven't used BB10 before, it is quite simply the most intuitive and logical UI available. Its flow and stability are amazing. It makes sense. The system shortcuts are brilliant and its multi-tasking prowess is far above its rivals.The build quality is very good, but there are two very abrupt edges to the sides of the keyboard that tend to grab at you as you slide across them. It does fit in a standard pocket, but it is a very large device.The battery life is colossal.",2015年12月13日 在美国审核
Great Device for the money and a no brainer at the 499.00 Black Friday Special,"First of all , I am a former iPhone 6 user and bought the passport on the official launch day. I have used the device as my daily driver since then and this review is based on my ""hands on"" experience for the last two months and not someone who picked up the device for 1 hour and based their review on that.Likes:Big bright screen and plenty of real estate for spreadsheets and emails, text is sharp and easy to read. Color is very accurate when looking at photos sent from my clients.Device is built like a german panzer tank, feels solid in you hand. I feel I got a quality made device for the money I spent.Blackberry OS10 is very fluid for my daily driver, I use my device mainly as my business tool and laptop replacement and this device fits the bill perfectly. Takes some time to adapt to, but now I could't be without it.Keyboard is great, took a while to get used to, but after a week, I found myself liking it better then a touch screen one. I also found my self typing with less errors.Processor is great and the screens and gesturing is snappy, if you haven't used OS10, give it time, you will find yourself liking the gesturing concept.The ""Hub"", nothing on the current market even comes close to this feature that is unique to Blackberry OS10. All of you messages, emails, Facebook/Twitter notifications in one area. Accessed by a single swipe to the right. Makes this or any Blackberry OS10 device a true messaging and business tool.Peak function on the main screen, lets you know who you messages are from and are displayed on the main screen. The message can also be accessed by tapping once to see the content and tapping agin to access it.I came back to Blackberry from being a long time Apple iPhone user, I have had a love/hate relationship with the brand since I left it several years ago. But, I decided to come back with the z10 was released last year. OS10 has had it's issues early on, but now with the ability to run Android apps and the improvements in the functionality, I am here to stay.If you have small hands, I will let you know this is a large device and takes two hands to really be efficient with the device. I am a big guy and have paws for hands and I have adapted to the device quite well. If you are used to using your current device with one hand, this may not be the device for you, but if you are willing to try something new, give it a chance.Camera, does a good enough job for what I use it for. I don't shoot videos or take my personal photos with my phone, thats what I have a Digital SLR and a good lens system for.At 499.00 for the black Friday special, this device is a no brainer, I bought one on launch day back in September, sold my iPhone 6 and I am not looking back. I use my smartphone for my business where my emails, text and social media apps are my top priority. I don't play games, watch movies or shoot videos or pictures with my device.If you are looking for a device that will increase you productivity with a great calendar, messaging capability and is reliable, give the passport a shot. You won't be disappointed.",2014年11月27日 在美国审核

I'm now a Blackberry Passport fan!,"I am a very experienced user of both iPhones and Android phones including every iteration from iPhone, all Galaxy Note, HTC M8, Sony Xperia and Google Nexus. For serious business use (email, docs, calendar, etc.) the Passport makes all the other phones seem like toys. I'd have a hard time moving back to a pure Android or iOS device.Here's what I love about the new Passport in no particular order:- Keyboard is awesome especially if you know how to type on a qwerty keyboard.- Build quality is rock solid. Feels like a super serious premium device. Doesn't feel fragile or delicate like an iPhone 6.- Excellent call quality and speakers. Great for phone conferences.- The HUB!!! All of your email accounts, social accounts, text messages and alerts in one list. I feel like there's no way I'd miss anything happening on any of my accounts. Much more effective and easier to use than iOS or Android notifications.- Blackberry Blend - essentially all of your phone interface and access to the Blackberry Hub on your computer. (Windows and Mac)- Battery life is phenomenal - I almost forget I need to charge it. Beats both iPhone 6+ and Galaxy Note 4's.- Screen - great quality screen - it's square and perfect for reading emails, websites and documents. Text also looks much clear on the Blackberry compared to iPhone 6.- Ability to load and run most Android apps via Amazon Store or Snap.Here are the weaknesses of the Passport:- Not great for watching videos or playing games.- Camera is getting better via software updates but not as good as cameras on iPhone 6+ or Note 4.- Not compatible with the Google ecosystem (i.e. Google Maps, Google Now, etc.)- Limited accessoriesIf you're looking for a phone for business activities this is by far the best you can buy right now.",2015年3月4日 在美国审核
Best phone I ever owned. Beats Android hands down.,"This phone works flawlessly. Easy to use. If you can't figure out how to do something with it just look up the instructions in the list of phone programs. Don't be afraid to buy this phone. It is easier to use than a Android phone. Believe me! I bought Android first but sent it back in 30 days. My Android's operating system was hacked in 27 days. They disabled the onscreen keyboard making the phone useless because I couldn't text or email. All I could do was talk on the phone which I rarely do. I prefer texting. I swore I would never buy another phone unless it has a full qwerty keyboard that is not onscreen only. This phone also can be your own wi-fi hotspot to connect your computer, tablets and other devices to. This hotspot works flawlessly too. Try this phone. You will love it.

Amazing device,"I always wanted to have a BlackBerry Passport since the day it was launched but I had some concerns as I was never able to run Google maps on BB10(my Z10). For me, running Google maps is a paramount feature that I want in a phone. So, I was waiting for the September Apple event and was considering buying an iPhone. Android was never an option for obvious reasons. Last Friday I recalled two occasions where I had used my wife's iPhone and the battery had drained in just few hours. After reading some reviews where people were able to run Google maps on their Passports, I finally made up my mind and ordered a Passport. And, what a wonderful decision that was.A magnificent screen, an impeccable physical keyboard and a beastly performance. All of that is very well complemented by a mammoth battery. I received mine with zero juice and my phone got pretty hot while first charging and setup. After 2 days the heating problem is gone.Pros:Battery performance: 65% battery charge used in 21 hours of mixed use. GPS was on for 1 hour.Screen: minimum brightness is good enough and I really like the color temperature option.Android apps: All have run fine without any extra effort. Google maps run great.Camera: Better than expected. I took some snaps at evening time and the colors came out great.Keyboard: so far so good. Typing will get better with practice.Voice quality: Great as mentioned in multiple reviews.Build quality: the best I have ever seen. Feels more sturdy than MacBook Air :)Cons: expensive covers.Thanks BlackBerry for creating such a wonderful device!I am very much pleased with the device.",2015年8月3日 在美国审核

New to keyboard,"I moved from a touch pad phone to the passport. I am a writer and wanted to see if this would improve accuracy...and it has.

I rely on my smartphone a lot and the Passport does what I need for emails and correspondence until I 'really need my laptop.' Browsing too is fun because of the screen width so it's like I have a mini-tablet with a real keyboard to type with. I'm female with small hands and it's fine, speakers are wonderful for music and conferencing. The Passport is really a mould breaker, like a different concept of 'smartphone,' ...no regrets here.

I've had this for about three weeks and I must say am impressed. This is my first ever blackberry and I switched over from my Xperia Z2 which was nice. I really wanted to try something new and BB10 OS is awesome. I got the passport partially because of the high end specs and large gorgeous display compared to other Blackberries.Now this has a slight learning curve but nothing overwhelming, I got used to the keyboard in about three days and now when I go through my chats (especially the ones with HER!) I no longer get a heart attack after realizing I made a terrible blunder from AUTOCORRECT :) the keys are spread across nicely and I also like the gestures you can do on them. By this, I mean the entire keyboard is touch sensitive! Just sweet! It also lights up in the dark and go off when there's light.The hub is outstanding! Having all your notifications, emails, text and whatnot in one place is just awesomeness. Makes it easy to see everything at a glance. Well I don't have to say too much, most people here have said it all, this is truly a wonderful machine.... it's shape might look weird but it doesn't hurt to look slightly different from the crowd does it?

Great communication device!,"I'm a diehard Blackberry user who has endured endless wisecracks and ribbing from the ""enlightened"" population of former Blackberry users who switched over to Apple and/or Android because those phones are for the cool people.

But not anymore. I love this phone, square screen and all.Now, I guess I'm not your typical phone user-I don't require a lot of apps and generally only text, email and talk on my phone.I do go on Facebook on occasion and really enjoy the larger screen for that app.Gmail works fine on my phone and I had no trouble syncing Google calendar (I read a review from someone who was unable to use any Google apps).I'm a bit disappointed in the number of available accessories-and that the purchase price dropped $100 right after I ordered it, but overall I have no complaints with this phone.If you use your phone for more than communicating- this phone is probably not for you.... for what I need a phone to do, it's perfect -I have a tablet, laptop and PC for everything else.",2014年11月24日 在美国审核

The user interface is outstanding and typing on it (which lets face it is what most of us do more than anything else on our smart phones) is SO much easier and efficient with a physical keyboard and BlackBerry's predictive text and gesture system.

Never owned a Blackberry but am intimately familiar with Android. There is no comparison.

Battery life has been my most pleasant experience, then the Hub. Already I have trimmed my navigation time to limits that make me more fully appreciate its utility. It was perhaps the numerous upgrades and patches that resulted in my disatisfaction with my S3. The only choice I saw was to invest in a new Galaxy. Yet, as security issues arose in this space, I became more drawn to the Blackberry. I'm no geek, but appreciate simplicity and speed. Love the keyboard and the Assistant feature is impressive.

"Passport, the best device on the Market today?","Being a tech lover and gadget person I had to try and write a review about this DEVICE! Starting with calling it a device and not a phone. Let's get some qualifiers in first. I have owned and used every version of the iPhone, nexus including the new six, Samsung including the new note.So I should be a good review opinion for anyone looking for some additional opinions ( also admit having had so many phones there must be some phyc issue with us gadget people?) another story.Also want to get this said. the new iPhone is simple,elegant,beautiful, and works flawlessly for the most part and is and will remain number one for the masses at least in North American amount those who can afford flagships phones period. So if you looking for what I described above look no more buy one of the IPhone's and end your burning of brain cells over a phone! I am and remain a certified Apple Lover as well.Ok so here goes. There is nothing and I mean nothing on the Market like passport period! That's well Maybe because it is not a just a phone! It is a device or more to true really a mini computer that is also a phone. As many have said before me it all depends on what your needs are as to if you will appreciate this device and love it like no other or walk away cold and dismiss it out of hand. The Passport is the best personal daily assistant ever( remember PDA's and how much we loved them? Yes it does more of everything you need to be productive and is a phone to boot! It's like if an IPhone is a daily to do list that's your favorite, the Passport is your complete business planning software program. It has a depth and breath no To Do list can or is designed to be! I can go on a lot but here is where I finally got some help and made my final,happy decision to buy one. Go to blackberry demos on the web and look at the how demos made as tutorials to use this phone. Watch the videos on just the calendar and calls section first oand I believe you will either be looking to order one immediately or happily walking away knowing the IPhone or Nexus or Samsung is for you, which after all is why we read reviews. As a tech lover I really hope BB makes a solid success with this product because it deserves to turn the lindustry on its head with this device and operating system. Sadly often what's best does not always lead the pack and market forces and critics are a giant wall against any BB product right now unfortunately. However it does deserve your time and attention if you want to see just what can be done with the devices we spend our big dollars on and carry around all day. If your in search of productivity there is NOTHING betterl I have ever used except my MacBook Pro! Yes a computer!Check out the demo videos and decide for your self. I should note also this is the second BB passport I bought. I gave up on my first one without digging deeper into the device capabilities and bending under the weight of the gorgeous IPhone 6 plus. But I got enough of s taste of it that I was drawn to it an unable to just blow it off as I showed off my IPhone 6 plus to all who could not get a 6 plus yet etc. I now have both. Guess what? I never even turn on the iPhone anymore. Good luck, if you take a chance you won't be sorry",2014年12月14日 在美国审核

Simply the best work utility smartphone period.,"Once I heard that BB won best OS in the world by ""Best In Biz Awards 2014 International"" I knew this was a game changer because they did it with almost NO marketing, and the phone they used for the contest was the BB Z30.I still use my Q10 as my daily workhorse, I just got my passport the other day so I'm not ready to make it my daily phone yet, but so far it's amazing from the screen size, to those wonderful keys to the build quality(it's in a steel frame), to the superb call quality and finally the Blackberry Hub.If you are a big App person Blackberry now runs Android apps (you need the ""Snap app"" to do this) and you also have access to the Amazon app store and Blackberry world so the ""App Gap"" that Blackberry had is now closed.This is the ultimate work utility. Blackberry builds serious phones for serious people. Employers tend to use Blackberry, employees tend to use everything else.",2014年11月3日 在美国审核

I love this phone,"I have this phone for 2 months now...I love this phone. I use to have iPhone starting from 3 all the way to 5 and I am so glad I switched to Blackberry Passport. I realized that whenever there is a new iPhone coming out, Apple will have a SW update and as a result of these SW update, it makes my current iPhone run slow and the batter drains faster. I think this was done in purpose to force users like us to go with the new model. With thisBlackberry passsport, the battery last at least 2 days for me even with heavy use - camera, email, browsing, social media, music, stock trading, mobile banking, webex, sms, bbm and normal phone call. The auto mute in the calendar really helps a lot. Previously, when I have the iPhone I have to manually mute my phone whenever I am attending a meeting. With Blackberry, it has this feature called the Meeting Mode, it looks at my calendar and mute and un-mute my phone automatically depending on what is in my calendar. The Blackberry Travel...I travel across the globe and my admin has to manually update my calendar to reflect my travel itinerary, now we dont have to do any of these as these are now automated by my Blackberry. The good thing about this Blackberry travel is that, it also monitors what is in my itinerary and automatically updates me in case there are changes. Also, I now can work on my emails while listening to my music while I am in transit across the Pacific or Atlantic and not worrying that my phone will still have enough juice when I land. Also, I can use ANY Android Apps that is available in Amazon and also Google world thru Snap. The Blackberry assistant is also very useful way so much intelligent and smarter than Siri. One thing I also noticed is that, when I am using my iPhone, there is always a part of that normal drive route going home or going to the office where my phone call will drop, I am actually surprised that with this Blackberry Passport, I never experienced any drop calls. The signal reception of the antenna of this phone is making wonders for me. The Blackberry Hub helps me look at all my messages in one location and there is even a place in the Hub where I can immediately look at the emails/message that are the highest priority. With iPhone, I have to scroll down to my last email to see if I missed any important message. The Blackberry Blend is also another helpful tool for me (no need to elaborate, you can just search and find out what it does). Lastly the keyboard/trackpad is awesome. Overall, after switching from iPhone to Blackberry, I can say that I am glad I did it. Now I see iPhones as a toy and not a productivity device like my Blackberry Passport.",2014年12月5日 在美国审核
The best smartphone I've owned,"I purchased this phone for myself about a week ago.I was looking for a more professional phone with good security and durability.This is it.The Passport has a tremendous battery life.Just yesterday, I used it most of the day until late night, and it went from 100% to still 67% charge.It could last another 2 days at my usage level before needing to be charged!I love the physical keyboard.It takes some getting used to if you've been accustomed to all these iPhone / Samsung virtual keyboards, but I've always preferred the physical keyboard, although I miss the speed of the swipe function of the Android virtual keyboard.The screen is square, so it actually makes reading better and looks more like a desktop screen.It's not ideal if you want to play games or watch movies, but for work purposes, it is excellent.The shape is more ideal for reading articles or looking over graphs and charts.The screen is incredible.It is a HD IPS (in-plane switching) LCD screen with exceptional resolution. The advantage of this type of screen is that it has a BETTER life span than a normal LCD or even OLED screen while retaining the same clarity. Keep that in mind.Also, and even better, you can read easily from this screen in direct sunlight!I was stunned when I discovered this while using my Passport outdoors and I realized I can see everything on screen perfectly without having to find shade somewhere.The build is quite sturdy.My silver edition has a metal frame which is quite solid.It is more stumpy in shape, which probably makes it more damage resistant than the elongated rectangular shapes of most oversized smartphones now.The shape also makes it feel much more secure in my pocket; I don't have to worry about it falling out.And even if it did, like I said, it's quite sturdy, and even moreso now that I have it in a leather case.The OS is the BEST I've ever used.Clean and smooth and fast.My phone was the unlocked version and there was no bloatware on it.I've owned a Note 3 and iPhone 6s+ and a Windows phone (and even my beloved Amazon firephone, too!), but Blackberry's OS 10 is the best.The downside is that its app store is not well-supported, but if you use the phone as a productivity device and not as a toy, the Passport is absolutely the best around.You could always load up the Google Play Store by yourself if you know what you're doing, but if apps are important to you, it is better to stick with Android (or maybe try the Blackberry DTEK or Priv hybrid phones).Personally, I already own an ipad, so I can have my fun apps on that, meaning my phone can be a productivity device.The Passport does have an Amazon appstore on it, so you can get most Amazon apps, including Underground games, too, if you like.That said, if you stick with the Blackberry native apps, they will run the quickest.I will admit to installing the Google store just so I could get my Kindle ereader; for some reason, it is not offered on the Amazon appstore for Blackberry, which is puzzling.I must praise the Hub, which collects all your emails / messages / facebook messages / etc in one easy-to-access location.It is a simple concept but once you use it, you will marvel at how useful it is!Nothing like it exists on other OS platforms.Other reviewers have mentioned this, but I will repeat it too - the Blackberry Passport is the best smartphone for WORK.It is NOT a toy.It has been designed to appeal to the business-oriented consumer.Casual consumers or app-lovers will not like this phone, but for business, you cannot find a better phone out there.",2016年8月30日 在美国审核
Best Phone We've Used to Date,"Candidly, I've never been able to understand buying preferences here in the U.S. It seems that many individuals feel the need to buy what a friend, colleague, or family member owns.This sheep mentality keeps people from finding and using other products that can truly be worth the examination and eventual purchase.The Blackberry Passport is just such an item.The battery life is nothing short of astounding!I am on my phone for business, from 6 a.m. until often 9-10 in the evening.Additionally, I use the phone as my daily alarm and still, I get two full days of battery life. Why more people don't own this phone is a mystery to me.I am not an individual that piddles with his phone all day as an excuse to fill time, and as such, I use fewer apps that most.However, I have side-loaded many Android apps to the phone and they work exceedingly well.I additionally believe, that having used every operating systems on multiple phones over the past two or more decades (I bought my first Motorola mounted phone in 1992), that the BB10 OS is by far the most user friendly operating system ever designed for a ""smartphone"", period.The ""HUB"" is the most underrated system of keeping track of all kinds of data communication I've seen yet.I believe that if more Americans knew how incredibly easy and efficient BB10 OS was, it would be a run-away success.Hard to know with +/- 3% market share, however.Oh well, thankfully, I am still the happiest with my Passport of any phone or system I've owned.Our business has owned and or used 5 Passport's to date and we wouldn't change a thing.Cheers,S",2017年4月2日 在美国审核
"If theres an instinct to buy, go for it!!! don't get affected by the brand name. BB is back!","Blackberry has really been facing brand image issues in the consumer market since a couple of years. I wasn't even planning to buy a blackberry. I was about to get the iPhone 6 when i came across this device. Configuration , utility and a great form factor! What better if even the look of your phone gives you satisfaction .Again, this device is not for everyone. Especially not for people with small hands. I can really hold the phone well in my hands and it feels great. Its so different from all the other devices in the market. And when you get used to it, other devices feel like crap.Been using it for a month now. No problems. still in love with it.Pros:Greaaat form factor. If you feel like buying it, don't think twice.great display. higher density than apple.classy look.high configuration.Cons:typing is slightly inconvenient with single hand.Small-handed people won't like it.(I tried using the BB passport as an ID in a Bar and turns out they need real passports..LOL)Blackberry has done a great job and this one can probably revive its brand. kudos to the passport!AFTER 2 MONTHS USAGE : The shortage of apps does make a difference. The Phone is a great one. But for the price tag, there are many better phones around. I'd still love to spend on this one if I've a budget to splurge. But for now, I chose to go for a different one (not hard to guess which one)",2014年12月8日 在美国审核
Awesome Job BlackBerry!,"I have been a BlackBerry fan for a few years now after trying iPhone, Androids, Windows Phones, and even Symbian (I know, it's long since dead). I could not find anything I liked (and I really don't care for apps, I need productivity tools, not games) so I decided to give BlackBerry a shot some years back with a BlackBerry Curve. I loved it immediately and have been a BlackBerry fan since.I upgraded to the Passport after hearing about how awesome a device it was. I had a Z10 before the Passport and I wondered until the day it arrived if I would really like a large, square screen. I can happily say I love it and I also love how my boss has to charge his iPhone twice in a work day while mine never gets below 75~ percent with constant use throughout the workday. Needless to say I love to rub it in his face!The large screen is amazing and with the touch sensitive keyboard I can use the entire screen to read spreadsheets or remote control computers from our office (all the while my boss doing the same thing is squinting and trying hard to type on the spreadsheet since his on screen keyboard is taking up most of the screen space).The phone is on the heavy side but feels like it would survive an impact on the chance that I would drop it (not happening!). I would highly recommend the BlackBerry Passport to any BlackBerry fans thinking about upgrading or anyone in general that wants an awesome phone with a marathon battery, quad core processor, and three gigs of ram!",2015年6月15日 在美国审核
and Samsung and this is by far the best phone I have ever had,"The last time I owned a Blackberry was back around 2007ish when Nextel had the Curve edition. Since then I have owned phones from HTC, Apple, and Samsung and this is by far the best phone I have ever had. I wish more carriers had it in the US other than the botched redesign that AT&amp;T offers. Luckily it comes unlocked and can order with a T-Mobile sim card. 1-2-3 and I was setup with service. Phone came in factory box with factory accessories. Works perfectly. I hope Blackberry can make a huge comeback. Everything from the screen, typing experience, battery life, speakers, and software is a perfect fit for someone who does a lot of email messaging and calls. Call quality was excellent and after talking to a few people on speakerphone no one could tell the difference when I was using it. Blackberry World which is the app store can use a little work but you also have full access to the Amazon app store and if you're a techie, can load the Android store on as well. (may have compatibility issues) If you can get to an AT&amp;T store try it out first if you need just don't purchase their version unless you really want to. The AT&amp;T version has a very limited selection of cases, screen protectors, etc.. and in my opinion, does not look as nice.",2015年4月30日 在美国审核
Underrated phone,"This phone is a lot bigger than what I thought it would be, and also better.After reading many reviews online, I purchased one and have been very impressed with the build quality, handling, and smoothness of the phone.In terms of build quality it's easily one of the best out there.It's very well balanced and using the keyboard is easier than I thought it would be - that said I still prefer the originally BB keyboard that the Classic has.Battery life on this phone is also excellent, and performance is good.I can't think of much I would improve on this phone.It can run android apps, and while I would prefer BB OS over Android, I think at this point BB needs to switch their products over to Android as it's clearly the dominant ecosystem.The phone certainly has its quirks, but if you're not tied to iOS or Android, it's a very appealing phone.",2015年10月7日 在美国审核

A great Blackberry,"I gotta admit , this thing has grown on me.I resigned myself to a smart phone because my favored Samsung Propel/Propel Pros are now so obsolete as to be , in effect , useless. The Passport features a real qwerty keyboard which I like and the touch screen is responsive enough to be manipulated with light taps, it also has the processing power to run youtube videos with ease. I have not nor will I avail myself of the various 'apps' and games out there as their user agreement terms seem awfully invasive , if im paranoid or wrong about that then my bad , I can live with it. As I DO enjoy games I found an online crossword site that works surprisingly well on the Passport. It serves well in all the capacities of a smart phone and Ive come to rely on it for many purposes including an effective 'note pad' for jotting things down.Ive had no problems with its software at all and its copacetic with my Att agreement , Im glad I got it",2016年1月25日 在美国审核

Some of the apps from the Android store are a little quirky but I assume this will happen until Google Play for Blackberry is released.The trackpad keyboard and thepanoramic, burst, and timeshift enabled camera are nifty additions and browsing with full pages is awesome.Hard to believe I managed with the now standard form factor of nearly every smartphone.Upgrade to a geniusphone when you are tired of the smartphone concept.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核

An Elite Phone for Elite Users,"It is not everyday that an innovative phone comes out which sets a new standard, breaks the numbed minds that expect the same thing over and over again and are willing to fork out thousands of dollars on a phone with the same technology that existed when the initial phone was released 7 years ago.The Passport is anything but a 'normal' device for the 'normal' user, it is the elite of mobile phone handsets targeting those who appreciate true innovation, and those who admire holding a real smartphone designed to make you work smarter rather than one designed to make you dumber by limiting the horizons of what one can and can't do.The Passport transcends all horizons with it's brilliant OS which keeps getting better and better by improvements based on the needs and wants of users. It's Hub makes communication both business and personal a breeze, sorting out unread messages and emails and notifications simply by pinching the screen is phenomenal - one pinch and you are viewing only unread items! Marking items as Read/Unread, deleting and archiving them is all done with a simple tap, yes just one tap.One swipe on the screen and you switch seamlessly between applications, and one tap to close them.The keyboard is out of this world! As you are typing you swipe up on the keyboard to select the word prediction you desire, YES the physical keyboard is touch as well!The sound quality is by far the best I've ever heard on a phone (better than the HTC One m8), the loud speaker is the best bar none.Processing speed is insane, Camera takes Amazing photos, and the ability to get every single possible application with it's full support for Android applications in addition to the Blackberry 10 applications makes it by far the most versatile OS to ever exist on a mobile phone handset.Do I recommend the Blackberry Passport? I've already converted over 40 people over from iPhones and Android devices over to Blackberry who now swear by the devices...does this answer the question?",2014年11月16日 在美国审核
It really is a great phone,"I've had people look at the phone and some say it's big and ugly and some say it's cool. I really don't care since it's my phone and I buy what suits me. This is an excellent phone. Yes, it does take a little bit to get used to the form factor, but it's rewarded with an incredible user experience. Coming from an iPhone 6 where their motto is it just works, I'm here to tell you, that is bull. I had more little nagging issues with the iPhones lately than I ever have with a blackberry. Yes, the passport is not an iPhone. But that's not why one would buy it.I bought it because I wanted the large screen, physical keyboard and blackberry 10 along with the great actual phone use (isn't that what you want out of a phone?). I am totally happy with my purchase and would do it again. If you're willing to give something a little different a try, you will be happy you did. This phone fits in all my pockets (guy) without any problem. Being shorter than most ""phablets"" it is real easy to carry in the front jean pocket. No problems bending over. Shirt pocket, no problem. Back pocket, no problem, just make sure you remember before sitting down.I can think of no negative issues I've had with this phone. Blackberry has created a winner here. And it'll only get better as they continue to upgrade the os. I see no drawbacks as far as I'm concerned. Just know that it's a two handed device going in.

"Good Phone! However, would NOT recommend due to lack of support.","This review is for the BlackBerry Passport Silver Edition.<br>I'd like to preface by saying this is by no means a negative review, but merely a review of a phone that I feel deserves a 3 star rating for my needs and wants from a smartphone.After a few years of owning an outdated android phone, I chose to shop for a new smartphone capable of satisfying my needs. A few of the features I deemed necessary were decent battery life, expandable storage, and a decent camera. It also needed to be unlocked (to be used with T-Mobile) and have the necessary antennas to work in Europe as I will be living there for the next few years. I did grow a bit tired of the android interface, and I've never been the biggest fan of iOS either. So it's safe to say, I was ready to try something new.Looks/Feel:I absolutely love the look of this phone. While setting up the phone, it seemed HUGE. However, after using it for a couple of days, going back to my old phone just makes it seem so small. Using this phone with one hand is difficult but not impossible. The textured backing allows me to the hold the phone firmly, giving me more confidence to use the phone one handed.The build quality is excellent. The phone feels very solid and has a bit of weight to it which I like. The keyboard responds well with an affirming ""click."" The touch capability of the keyboard is a nice added feature.Expandable storage:Nothing much to explain here. Although I would like to say that I got a bit nervous taking off the plastic cover to access the SIM and SD card ports, fearing that I would snap some of the pins because the build is so sturdy.Battery Life:Pretty decent. With constant use, I would say that the battery drains pretty linearly for about 10 hours (I used it constantly on the first and second day). However, the battery holds itself amazingly well if I'm not using it, more than other phones.I'll also throw this in here since I don't know where else to put it: The phone gets a bit warm near the volume buttons.The heat is not unbearable, just warm. This affects the screen, metal casing, and textured backing in the near vicinity. I would like to note that this is while using battery intense functions, like playing music loudly on the speakers and using the GPS.Camera:The camera is alright. It's not phenomenal, but it does everything that I need it to. There are 2 things that I don't like about it though:1. It takes forever to focus (up to 3 seconds, which is actually quite long compared to other smartphones).2. It has poor low-light performance.Speakers:I did notice that as you increase the volume to around max, the vocal seems to become louder relative to the song, making the music seem unbalanced, or not as full. Perhaps it's just my imagination.Regardless, I prefer listen to it a few clicks off the max. All in all, still crisp and pretty good.Cons:1. Though the phone has a 1:1 screen ratio, it doesn't operate the same in ""portrait"" and ""landscape."" How hard is it to give it the same functionality?! It really shouldn't be that hard. Obviously the keyboard is sideways, preventing me from typing, but what I'm talking about is different.For example, when you're on the web browser in portrait orientation, you can do a two-finger swipe down from the top to access the quick settings menu. You can't do that in landscape orientation.The home screen and app pages remain oriented for portrait mode. I realize that android, and perhaps iOS, do NOT reorient their apps either, however, both of those OS's exist on phones withOUT a 1:1 screen ratio. The 1:1 screen ratio should make this very easy. Easily fixable via software update...2. VERY LITTLE SUPPORT. This is my biggest issue. Though I bought the phone to satisfy my basic necessities, this is a huge problem. The issues I mentioned previously may never be solved, especially since software updates seem to be few and far between (according to online).Additionally, I've never been a big into app games, but I do happen to use some of the popular apps, such as Facebook Messenger. But Facebook recently decided to pull the plug on BlackBerry. I realize that I can login on the mobile site to check my messages, but I might as well have all my friends email me if that's the case. At least I'll get a notification on the BlackBerry Hub (notification bar) that way. Additionally, Whatsapp Messenger will no longer be supported starting 2017 since it was acquired by Facebook, so I'll have to find another incredibly popular internet-based messenger to use while I'm in Europe.Some apps that I wish were available:-Whatsapp Messenger-Facebook Messenger-Yelp-Google Maps (There is Waze, though)-Google Chrome-UberAnd I'm sure more as I continue to use it.There are ways to install android apps using the sideloaded developer app SNAP, but the recent BB 10.3.2 update prevents SNAP from running properly.All in all, this is a decent phone, but had the potential to be a great one. I was a bit optimistic thinking that the few ""necessities"" I mentioned earlier were all I really wanted/needed, but there are cheaper phones out there that satisfy those ""necessities"" for a cheaper price and come with OS and app support. This phone is like a bull locked in an office; so much oomph, yet tethered to emails and reading documents. I hate to say it but BlackBerry is a dying breed. I really wanted to love this phone, but now I feel like I'm settling for it.</br>",2016年8月25日 在美国审核

"It's a work tool, the best one around.","You are getting what you see. The phone works as intended, email is very swift and with a lot of features. The keypad lets me even type without looking at the screen (after a couple of months), the touch function of the keypad very rarely (1/800 lets say)gets a bit tricky and you have to take your finger from it and start again.The construction is very solid and with a simple protective case, it makes it extremely sturdy, I've dropped it a few times, no damage at all.The operating system has a few glitches, I've had this phone for about half a year and 2 or 3 times it has had shut downwithout me noticing it, Amazon app store is not very strong as Google play store or iTunes store, Blackberry AppWorld store is really basic. Never the less, I managed to put Google Play services in the phone, with a little search you can find your way.Even with the few glitches on the OS, the keypad being good (but not perfect), and the lack of a robust app store, I'm rating it 4 starts because I never intended to make this phone my ""recreational"" device, I want a work tool and this fits the best. I've tried iOS, Android, and Blackberry is the best for that job. I would rate it 5 stars if it had a proper app store like google play.",2015年5月14日 在美国审核
One of the best devices I have ever owned,"I have been using my Passport for about 6 weeks now so it seems appropriate to write a review. In theory, the honeymoon should be over, but it's not. Not even close. Like a lot of business execs, I was a BlackBerry user years ago. At some point I switched to Android and really liked my Motorola Droid slider, but then Apple came along and I jumped on board. After 3 years using an iPhone, I couldn't bear it any longer. The pathetic battery life of my iPhone 5, especially in the cold New England winters when I would start skiing with a full battery and less than 2 hours later it would barely have enough of a charge for a quick call. The never ending hunt for someplace to charge while on the road, competing with the masses for an elusive outlet. Or the degradation of the virtual keyboard, with more misses than hits as time passed, making it only useful for brief text messages. Call handling was a complete joke - every time a call would come in and I'd try to switch, the initial call was disconnected. Every. Single. Time. Not very professional.I was ambivalent about switching to BlackBerry OS, as my entire digital life is Apple (MacBook Pro, iPad, iPhone, iPod). What about the apps? I did my research. BlackBerry has a sad little app store, but their devices run Android apps and they partnered with Amazon and now have their App Store on their devices. I found most, but not all, of the apps I used previously. I'm a techie, so I installed an app called SNAP which provides access to the Google Play Store. I picked up a few more apps there. For those I could not get to work, I use the browser. I am whole again.My white Passport is a head turner. People ask what it is and are universally surprised it's a BlackBerry (and that BlackBerry is even still in business. Hello BlackBerry! Spend some marketing dollars, please!), and then they reminisce about their old BlackBerry and how they miss the keyboard. I really love my Passport, and here's why:- The keyboard is really outstanding. The learning curve was surprisingly short and I am typing as fast as I ever did on my old BlackBerrys.- The battery life is unmatched. I use my Passport more than any other device I own. Every day. The longest I have gone without a charge is 36 hours!- It's a good looking, well-built, solid device. It doesn't look or feel cheap and I have dropped it a few times already and not a scratch. (Unlike the new iPhone 6, which I seriously considered, and I found to be plastic-y and of cheap quality when compared to my iPhone 5. Very disappointing for the price.)- The screen is big, but doesn't feel huge, and it's clear. My middle-aged eyes appreciate that very much.- There's an application called Blend which basically allows me respond to and send text messages while on my Mac. Very easy to use and I love the convenience.- Call handling is perfect and the call quality is outstanding. As good as it was on my old Motorola devices which were outstanding phones.- There are quite a few features for setting preferences, e.g. setting the device on bedside mode, vibrate only, calls only, etc. My only complaint is that there should be a timer that allows, for example, bedside mode to revert to normal at 7:00am when I awake. I keep forgetting to change it and miss calls. Minor nit.- It fits in my back pocket. Sometimes I even forget it's there.- The camera produces very good images, but the shutter speed and focusing is unacceptably slow. BlackBerry really needs to fix that. Now.If you are seriously considering buying Passport and decide to take the plunge, you will not regret it.Tammy M.",2015年4月16日 在美国审核
The Passport is to Smartphones what the Avengers are to Marvel Studios! It is A MUST for those who want to change their world!,"My last BlackBerry was the Torch. After years of BlackBerry, I was given an iPhone, and from there I entered the Android world with a Samsung Galaxy 3. I loved BlackBerry, but realized the lack of apps (and at the time) browser speed made it obsolete for early adopters like myself. I liked the iPhone, but I didn't appreciate being limited to the ecosystem. Though a macophile who has kept a macbook for years, it wasn't a good fit. Samsung was a welcome fix. I enjoyed the freedom and the android operating system and thought I would stay with the brand. Then a friend sent me a link to a Porsche design BlackBerry. I was impressed with the look. Perusing through the BlackBerry site, I was drawn to the Passport and it's functionality.The Passport is everything BlackBerry was without the limitations of the past. With specifications that rival the new iPhone 6 and Samsung 6, it takes a step beyond both. BlackBerry has security, an amazing OS (which tops both iOS and Android for personal and business functionality), a unique aesthetic which stands out from the look-a-like crowd, BB apps/Amazon apps/Android apps at your fingertips, a quality camera, and it has substance and heft. It feels like a premium phone should.",2015年6月23日 在美国审核

It's incredable,"Without going into all the techie mumbo jumbo this phone is awesome! The only problem is getting accustomed to the dimensions but the blackberry passport has surpassed all my expectations for a blackberry device. To be honest i bought this device because i grew tired of typical phones (android, apple, windows phone) , nothing stands out anymore , there is no push for true innovation. I have no complaints about this phone and i think ill have it until it eventually dies. It may not have all the gimmicks and all the overhyped marketing but it is a solid device that does what it does well. Great camera, true multitasking, great audio quality, nice app support, great battery life and great support as a business device (its a blackberry.)",2015年8月19日 在美国审核

"Unfortunately, It's The BEST Phone Ever Made.","This is, unfortunately, the best phone ever made.Why do I say unfortunately, you ask? Because it is now running an OS that will soon be abandoned thanks to poor decisions made by BlackBerry's current CEO.But I digress. Here is why it's the best phone ever made:- The screen is gorgeous, and will wow your iPhone 6s wielding friends.- The OS and software is fluid and snappy, and will make your Android wielding friends jealous (including those unfortunate enough to buy a Priv by mistake).- Multitasking is the best I've seen anywhere (mobile or desktop).- The native photo editing software is very good. Editing photos on the wide, square screen is actually enjoyable.- The native video editing software is the best I've seen on mobile. You can edit video clips, add audio, use different themes, and export to 1080p.- It runs most Android apps on the Amazon Appstore rather well.- There are some really good, native, BlackBerry10 apps not available for other platforms (many are specifically designed to take advantage of the large, square screen).- The keyboard doubles as a cursor.- The web browser is the most HTML5 compliant mobile web browser (last time I compared was a few months ago). So go head and view those WebGL demos on the phone.- It matches your Macbook Pro.- BlackBerry Blend lets you access your device's files and communications on Mac/Windows.For Geeks:- The OS is fully POSIX compliant.- This means you can port your favorite Unix apps over to BlackBerry10.- You can download a free native terminal, and install many ported apps including GCC, Vi, and SSH.- You can write, run, and compile C/C++ code directly on the device.- Already includes Python version 3.2.- The best mobile IDE I've ever used is only available on BlackBerry10.",2015年12月2日 在美国审核
Very happy with the BlackBerry Passport SE!,"When the charging port got damaged on my Z30, it was a reason for me to order the BlackBerry Passport SE sooner than I had planned to.But, I can't say I'm disappointed it happened, and the Passport SE is really awesome.I have now used it for over a month, and I really like it.The browser is very fast, and the square screen is really nice to work with. It is a wide phone, but once I got used to it, it seems just right.Now it is actually a bit strange to look at the screen of the Z30, because I don't have to flip the phone all the time, to look at some documents, spreadsheets, websites etc.If you are considering this phone, and have never used Blackberry, I highly recommend giving it a try.The BB10 OS, is despite what naysayers and BB haters say, a really great operating system. Especially if you have to deal with multiple email accounts/ websites etc. for your business.Safety is top notch, and if you get really into using it, the BlackBerry Blend is another great feature with this OS.When it comes to apps, there are a few that are not available, at least not yet. It is nothing that affects me, and I feel this is a phone well geared towards business users, not kids with a lot of time on their hands.../",2015年10月22日 在美国审核
Best Productivity Phone,"This phone is by far the best phone I have had as a business professional. As a business professional, I talk, text, email and occasionally surf the web as necessary. It's user interface is great and far more useful than the past IPhone, Android and Nokia/MS smart phones I have had. It's width is its best and worst feature. It is not a easy to carry around in a pocket as a IPhone or MS phone but it makes reading emails and texts very easy. The best feature of it is the BB Hub and it is one stop shopping for all you communications. I have had this phone for 1 month and very satisfied with it. The downside to it, is that certain wearables like the IWatch or MS Band 2 either does not connect or difficult to do so. (Why deal with the headaches of trying to get it online?)Give yourself a break and just go out and buy a MS Mobile Win 10 phone for a $150 and the MS Band 2 for thesame price if you really want one. The volume of Apps are definitely much more narrower but most of the Apps on Apple Store are gearedtowards consumer needs not business needs. I do use some of the stand apps with it such as LinkedIn, etc. and they work very well. The phone is clear and the buttons are easy to use and not flimsy. It is a heavier piece of hardware compared to my IPhone 5S or my MS phone. Its battery life is much longer than my MS phone. I use ATT as my carrier and it does not drop calls . Since it is a GSM phone, only ATT and T-Mobile will allow it to run on its network. As for receiving and reading PDFs and other docs, it works great. If you want to stay focused and be productive, this is the phone to have.",2016年8月12日 在美国审核
Love the phone,"Love the phone. Does everything that I was expecting it to do. Some nice features:1) Blackberry blend - a must if you're like me who keeps the phone somewhere else other than beside you or in your hand2) Camera resolution is crisp even with the front camera3) Finally, Excel spreadsheets!4) There's a mouse-like function. Yes, double tap the keyboard and up pops a mouse that you can highlight, edit formats, copy, paste, share one phrase etc.5) keyboard can be used as a scroll6) multiple tasks can be run all at once. Sort of like windows7) access to three eco systems: Google Play, Amazon and Blackberry worldOne notable con. The stock app for the camera is not that good. But for $2.99, get the app in the blackberry world called Camera++ and you'll have an SLR'ish camera in your passport.Concerned about the size?

All i can say is wow...,"The original blackberry passport is a beauty of a device but the silver edition? Words can't even describe how it looks...astonishing! Awarded the Red Dot Product Design of 2015 over the iphone 6; It is also voted the best OS in the world, BB10 ensures security and productivity for those with a busy lifestyle and always on the go. Working and editing your PowerPoints and spreadsheets is far superior from limiting candy bar style phones. It gives you more space by working wide. And the battery life can last up to 2 days. I disconnected my phone today at 6 a.m. for work, it's 6:30 p.m. And I am still at 60% battery life.I couldn't even get through 4 hours without charging on the iphone 4s.

Very well designed phone.  Lives up to hype. UPDATE POST 10.3.1 SOFTWARE UPDATE - NOW A MUST HAVE.,"I'm 24 and tech savy.Have had phone for 3 months now.Was a 2 time Android user before (Galaxy S Captivate &amp; Galaxy SIII).Can confidently say that this phone goes toe to toe with those phones in functionality in just about every way.Enjoyed the phone so much I got one for my father for Christmas and he loves it too.Never had a QWERTY keyboard on a phone before and I love having it now.Much better than touch screen texting.Only downside to wideness is that you cannot text with one hand easily.It is possible, but only for small limited responses.Besides that one downside, the width is a positive for every other aspect.When viewing websites I have it set to desktop mode and it is awesome.For those worried it fits easily and comfortably in pockets, it does no problem.BB10 (the operating system) takes a little getting used to (Google search tips to make sure you fully utilize some of its less obvious features - especially in the keyboard which is touch sensitive) but once you do it is definitely smoother and faster than Android which I was pleasantly surprised to find.I am an AT&amp;T user in the US and service is great and internet is lightning quick.The BlackBerry Hub that organizes all messages from all formats is really cool and helpful for someone like me that regularly uses 5+ email accounts, along with texting, bbm, facebook messenger, gchat, etc.If specific APPs are not your top priority then I highly recommend this phone.Battery life is fantastic.Much better than any phone on the market.Average day's use I find myself with half my battery life left at the end of the day.I am yet to have a single day where I ran out of battery (This was a problem I experienced regularly with the Galaxy S3).A++ to BlackBerry for the battery!Tips for Apps I commonly used to use with my Android: (SEE UPDATE BELOW)MAPS: Buy BeMaps Pro.Costs like 5 bucks but is a fully function BlackBerry Native App based on Google Maps.Perfect for phone.UBER: Just make shortcut to mobile website on homescreen. Mobile based website is HTML5 enabled and works no problem. No need for actual app.Facebook/Twitter/Linkedin/Google Talk: Native BlackBerry versions of these apps work fine.Amazon App store: works great for most apps such as Pandora.Other common Android Apps: Android framework can be sideloaded into phone (search for Cobalt's work).I've done this and can say it works fine to get functionality to apps such as Snapchat, but it takes some work to get going and is not a perfect solution due to square dimensions of screen.I personally just said screw it and if I want to use these apps just revert back to playing with old Android S3 over wifi.If these apps are a necessity to you then stick with Android.Google Music: Made homescreen shortcut to google music through browser and the browser version works fine as long as you have Adobe Flash enabled in your browser settings.Long story short, if silly apps are not that important to you, then pull the trigger and buy this phone.You won't regret your decision.UPDATE: Updated phone to new 10.3.1 software.After doing so I re-installed all the Google framework (3 files) from ""Cobalt"".There's a youtube video out there that walks you through the same process so it is very painless.Now I have been able to get ALL Android apps that I regularly use working.I have fully functioning Google Maps, Uber, Play Music, WatchESPN, Banking apps, Snapchat, Tinder, etc.A cool new feature with this update for the Passport is that it allows you to run apps in a Narrow mode that defaults to the dimensions the app was designed for.The only downside is the Android apps still do not send push notifications through to the hub, however that is the only missing link to having a perfectly functioning Google Play Store.There now is NO reason that I would prefer any other phone to the BlackBerry Passport.QNX RULES!Cheers!",2015年2月15日 在美国审核

Possibly the best phone ever!,"I have had a great a great experience overall with this phone, I have owned almost every phone that is in the market today, from the iPhone 5s, 6, 6+, Note Edge, Galaxy S5, LG G3, LG G2, HTC One M8, Nexus 6, Blackberry Z10 &amp; Z30 and many more perhaps not worth mentioning.. I really like this device, it feels solid in hand and the tactile feed back from the keys is superb, I will be completely honest, I wanted to return this phone after the first day but I kept it and give it the time it deserves.. From the battery life to the excellent Blackberry Blend alliance it's nothing short of phenomenal.. it is no wonder why this marvel is getting recognition from all sides of the globe.. Many will say that Blackberry world doesn't have the apps that iPhone or Android has but the truth of the matter is that this phone is not for someone whom wants to play the latest games day in and day out, this handset was built with productivity in mind. Using several of the apps I used on both the iPhone and the Android market I can say that 95% of the apps that I need for work productivity I found either in BB World or via Snap.. this device has the capability of using BB world, Snap and also Google Store.. and the process is so simple.. it does take a bit of user input to install the Snap client but once it's done Voila!! Bliss!There are a few issues though.. some are the 3rd party apps that don't work well with the Passport and that is merely due to the screen size like Netflix.. I don't know about ya'll but when I travel I stay on Netflix it's the best app out there, since it doesn't display 100% well I can always use the device to mirror unto an actual Television screen. Overall I can say that this phone deserves a look ifyou are serious about staying organized, this is the phone for you.. did I mention the battery life? I unplugged my phone yesterday at 1530 and right now it's 1630 the next day and I still have about 8% left.. This my friends is what you call battery life!!",2015年2月13日 在美国审核

I almost forget it needs charging sometimes. Talk about attention seeking! Everytime I pull it out of my pocket people ask about it. The keyboard is a charm not forgetting the power of blend.

The BlackBerry Passport easily beats the iPhone 6 or 6+ for business use.  Read why:,"The BlackBerry Passport is a total winner for business use.Below is a list of specific reasons why.But let me preface that I tried the iPhone 6 for seven weeks, the 6+ for two weeks, and the 5S for a week, but the Passport is clearly the best after three solid weeks of use.Here are the hard failings of the iPhone 6 when connecting to the company e-mail with Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync.MS Exchange is No. 1 in the corporate market.Note that the BlackBerry Passport does not have any of these problems.I know the iPhone doesn't have some of these problems when using Google Calendar, but most people are not on Google calendar.It bears repeating:the Passport works well, and none of the iPhone issues below are present on the Passport.1.Changes to calendar entries in Microsoft Outlook are relatively often not reflected to the iPhone.This issue is still outstanding since at least Jan 2013.You can do a web search for apple discussion 4736007 for details.The Passport syncs every time.2.Information coming with meeting invites is cut off at the 500 character count on the iPhone so that you often cannot see the conference call in number and access code.What needless pain.The Passport doesn't cut off information sent with your invites.3.Updates from your Outlook server based calendar over to your iPhone calendar take many minutes to hours to appear.The Passport does it reliably in seconds, even without BES.This is critical when meeting location or access codes get changed at the last second.4.The iPhone cannot display other company employee's calendar based availability.The Passport shows you the availability of the people at your company that you want to invite, so you can more easily set up time to meet, without having to go back and forth to find a suitable time line the iPhone forces you to do.5.The iPhone cannot reserve a conference room.The Passport can easily reserve a conference room including telling you whether and when it is available.6.Draft e-mails initiated on a desktop computer in Outlook, do not appear on the draft e-mails portion of the iPhone.On the other hand, draft e-mails made on MS Outlook show up right away on the Passport, and vice versa.I know there is a clumsy work around for the iPhone for this problem, but it requires extra software on the iPhone.7.Finding e-mails with attachments mixes all e-mail accounts together on the iPhone, making searches more difficult.If you have corporate e-mail and personal e-mail on the iPhone, when you search for e-mails with attachments, both e-mail accounts are mixed together in the search results.That is just unnecessarily annoying.The Passport separates such searches beautifully.8.The iPhone doesn't allow you to selectively delete an e-mail on the iPhone only but still keep it on the server.That really clutters up the e-mail on the iPhone.If you need to do e-mail triage after a trans-continental flight, you will want to delete all the low priority ones from the phone for viewing later on your notebook at the hotel, so you can focus on the critical ones by leaving them on your smartphone.On the iPhone, you can't delete low priority ones, because if you do, they are either gone to trash, or at best in the Archive folder.So then scrolling through hundreds of low priority e-mails you can't remove on the iPhone is a pain.The Passport allows you with one click to delete any e-mail on the server or on the Passport, or both, your choice.A default is also allowed.That is great if you are like most busy people that get a several hundred or more e-mails per day.So those are the killers for the iPhone, but the Passport can perform all with a smile.Here are some things that are annoying on the iPhone iOS 8.1.3, but work smoothly on the Passport:A.If you are running late for a meeting, you can easily e-mail the organizer and/or attendees that you will be late, with a slider bar to adjust the number of minutes you are late by.So cool, but not easily possible on the iPhoneB.Meeting notifications stop coming on the iPhone if you are past the meeting time.On the other hand, the Passport still reminds you of a meeting that you missed, even if you are running late, until acknowledged.That is critical for busy people that often run late, but need a reminder of a missed meeting.C.The Passport screen is wide, so you can see full, native web-pages.Also, when zooming into a web page, the Passport reformats the larger text to flow around, so you don't need to scroll back and forth.The iPhone has a narrow screen relative to its height, so if you don't want to have to move the web-site left and right, you have to use a small font.But then you need a magnifying glass to read it.On the Passport, the wide screen allows you to see the web-site naturally, or if you really want, zoom in, and still don't need to pan left or right.The screen resolution is great on the Passport, as good as the iPhone 6.D.Editing your text in an e-mail can all be done from the keyboard on the Passportr.No awkward placing your finger on top of what you want to edit like on the iPhone.Just a quick double tap on the touch sensitive Passport physical keyboard, and then you can slide your fingers back and forth or up and down on the keyboard to move the cursor in the text right where you want it.None of this ""reachability"" that the iPhone 6 and 6+ need.Editing is amazingly good.Selecting the suggested word with a quick swipe up on the touch sensitive keyboard works very nicely once you realize it should only be a short swipe, not all the way to the word itself.E.The Passport warns you if you are about to set a meeting in the past.The iPhone doesn't warn you, so it is easy to not realize that it is actually five minutes later than you think.If you do set a meeting partly in the past on the iPhone, the others won't get notified, as I mentioned.But the Passport warns you so you can avoid that simple mistake.That is user friendly.F.When typing a series of numbers like phone numbers etc, the Passport leaves the number entry keyboard up on the screen even after typing a space.The iPhone on the other hand forces you to hit numbers button again when you hit a space, if you want to add more numbers.The Passport shows the numbers, and of course if you need to switch to letters, you don't need to hit anything because the physical keyboard is right there.At first, I thought having the numbers as virtual numbers on the screen would be confusing, but it isn't at all.It's easy and natural.G.The Red Light!This genius of an indicator tells you silently when you have a new message or notification.You can just glance down at your shirt pocket to see if anything came in.On the iPhone, you can't tell if anything is there without taking the phone out of your pocket and looking at the face, unless you have the annoying ding ding or vibrate turned on during the meeting.The blinking red LED is great for a business person in a meeting.H.If you have a large number of unread e-mails, the iPhone will count every one and let you know, for me, about 862 unread e-mails.That is USELESS.The Passport will tell you thatyou have unread e-mails since the last time you looked, which is all you really care about.I.The BlackBerry Hub is absolute genius.From one screen, you can easily delete or act on emails, texts, calendar invites, BBM, replies, drafts, etc all from one screen, with just a single swipe to get there from anywhere.The wide Passport screen allows you to see everything and touch the icons even with massive paws some people have.The Hub is so great, I'm shocked the iPhone hasn't copied it yet.Here is a list of what is worse on the Passport than on the iPhone:I.There is no Apple Pay on the Passport.Apple Pay is really cool because you can use it with the phone locked, just need to acknowledge the transaction.II.No Undo function while editing on the Passport.This deficiency is unfortunate.The iPhone on the other hand does respond to you physically shaking the iPhone to bring up the ""Undo"" menu.Hopefully BlackBerry will fix that in the future.It is probably the only thing that bothers me not having on the Passport.Here is how the Passport is worse than BB7 (BlackBerry Bold)a.When scrolling through times from 57, 58, 59, then 0 minutes to set a meeting, the hour count no longer increments.So when rotating the wheel from 59 to 0, you actually are moving backwards an hour.Not smooth.The iPhone is the same BTW.b.The Passport keyboard is wide enough that you will need two hands to type on it.c.The BB7 default allowed you to have a ring tone setup that vibrated first, then made an audible noise.I had to make a custom ringtone for the Passport to do that, but doing so was easy, and works great.d.At this time, the Passport doesn't work on Verizon (CDMA).But from my tests, the large antenna on the Passport makes up for that, so I get reception inside elevators with AT&amp;T service, which I previously could only get with Verizon, in Silicon Valley.Finally, although I don't use many apps, all eight Android apps I tried worked well on the Passport.I also moved about half my iTunes over (16 GByte), and the Passport music player plays them well.The speaker is powerful.The Passport battery is a champ.Even with full use you have spare capacity at the end of the long day.You can easily tell which app is using your power.I notice that some Android apps are not as power efficient as equivalent iPhone apps are.But I don't use them much, so don't really care.The responsiveness to finger touches is very good on the Passport, as good they are as on the iPhone.Gestures like spreading or pinching fingers to zoom in and out work great on either phone.Sending pictures either by e-mail or text or BBM, works great on the Passport, and on the iPhone.Unpacking the iPhone 6 was exciting, but there was no training for it after turning it on.Apple just assumes it is so natural you don't need training.The on-line manual for Apple is quite rudimentary.On the other hand, when the Passport turns on, it has training built in, so you learn in a few minutes the four or so swipe motions you need, and you are off and using it.It shows you, and corrects you in case your aren't quite right.That is new user friendly.You can of course go back as I did a few times for a refresher.I felt I was a power user with the Passport after maybe three days, while on the iPhone, even after seven weeks, I still got lost, and of course, often got reminded of its business related limitations.Lest you think I am Apple bashing, I'm not.I've been using Macs very happily full time at home and work since June 1986, the Mac Plus was great!The rest of my immediate family uses iPhones (4S, 5, and 5S), and I can see why they would prefer them to the Passport, but they don't work for a living.",2015年2月17日 在美国审核
This isn't your little sisters bendy iPhone!,"Had quite a few iPhones prior and currently using a work-issued Galaxy S4 alongside this BB as my personal phone. Quite simply, the Passport is by far the best one for me!!!! So much so that I've provisioned my work email account on it just so I can use it for work as well and not have to deal with the virtual keyboard on the Galaxy. The only reason I still have to carry the Galaxy around is because I refuse to give out my personal phone number at work so now I'm stuck with the Galaxy for work-related voice calls.I'm not an app whore so don't mind the lack of a gazillion options on the Passport. My communication needs and device usage breaks down as follows: 40% email (including associated document editing)/text &amp; calendar management, 30% voice, 30% web/social media. If you're a serious professional with secure unified communication needs and possible content generation/manipulation needs on the go, do yourself a huge favor and pick up this phone!And don't get it twisted - I saw a review on-line the other day showing someone watching a movie on this and comparing it to the iPhone 6, then claiming that you end up with a much smaller-sized image on the BB. What that reviewer doesn't get is that a better comparison would have been to also include (in addition to the movie clip) a webpage, document, email thread or other scenario that requires use of the keyboard as you view the image on the screen given that most users of this device will probably want to use it that way most times if not exclusively. The result would have been a much smaller display area on the iPhone in most of the examples on account of the virtual keyboard that would pop up and take up almost half the screen real estate.Did I mention I've totally abandoned my Outlook for Black Berry Blend on the good ol' desktop?",2014年11月11日 在美国审核

Beautiful Real High-End Device! Wall of text incoming...,"To the people that can't decide between this and an iphone, do google search for spec comparison and the choice will be obvious. PLEASE JUMP OFF THE IPHONE BANDWAGON! I personally don't compare the 2 phones but for many people it's always all about the iphone. My husband has an iphone from his job, a samsung for personal use and my last 2 phones have been blackberry but I've also used samsung and HTC. We both agree that the build quality and OS10 from Blackberry far surpass that of any other phone we've had. In addition, you are getting what you pay for when it comes to the internals which a lot of people must not be paying much attention to when they dish out 600 bucks for their flimsy aluminum and plastic iphone. Ok, rant off.This particular phone feels hefty and very durable, the most high end feel and look of any phone i've ever come across. Looks very sleek and not as big as you would think in your hand, my hands are small to average size for a woman I suppose. I imagine the frame is impossible to bend with your bare hands, the keyboard is also reinforced with the same steel. The backing feels fantastic in the hand but I'm still waiting for my portfolio case from crackberry. The headset is comes with is superior to any earbuds i've used and they actually stay in my ear which is very rare for me. Great sound quality and a button for pausing video/music for taking a call, it might answer the call too but i'm not sure yet. I expect I will not be replacing this phone for a long time, it's what I've been wanting, a physical keyboard with a larger square screen. The steel body is icing on the cake.This phone can do everything, work, play, entertainment. I dare appleheads to try one of these for a month and go back to their iphone. Just a tip to anyone purchasing, make sure you have a nano sim card from your carrier for setup, I had a micro sim card which is larger (from my q10). Some users say you can cut the card to fit but I recommend just getting the nano from your carrier and having it for unboxing day! I have read some horror stories about the card getting stuck when its cut. Lastly, I recommend getting Snap for your phone for the google play store if the app you want is not available in Blackberry store or amazon app store.

The Binford 9000,"I love this phone! My previous phone was the BlackBerry Q10. I was waiting for AT&amp;T to sell the BlackBerry Passport since September. I kept looking at the reviews in Amazon everyday, was keeping up with Crackberry and N4BB to see if AT&amp;T decided to finally release the BlackBerry Passport . I got impatient with AT&amp;T. So I decided to buy it from Amazon on Black Friday.Once I got it, I felt like the time when I first got the Nintendo 64 for the first time in Christmas. The texture of this phone was amazing. I thought it was going to have some sharp edges on the stainless steel frame, but it turned out smooth. Looking at the phone before I powered it on was like looking at a black diamond. I didn't mind the weight because it felt like I was holding a solid phone.The battery is awesome. The longest my battery lasted was 52 hours with regular use and 20 hours on heavy use (Netflix, YouTube, and long phone calls) . I can finally use apps that I couldn't use before on my Q10 (USAA, Wells Fargo, and Sirius XM). The images are crisp. The speakers are superb. Blackberry Blend is outstanding.The attention I get from this phone is crazy. I had a few people stop me to actually see and hold the BlackBerry Passport. A lot of people were curious and we're thinking of switching from their Android and iPhone. Once they got to know the phone, they made up their minds to buy one too.I can go on and on about the Passport. Buy one and you won't regret it. When. You do, and you come across a learning curve, ask anyone here or check out some of the previous reviews to see if anyone came across the same issue. Most likely it has already been solved. You can also go to the BlackBerry website and find video tutorials and how to videos. Please don't rate this product for not taking the initiative on getting to know your phone. Obviously every OS is different. You'll learn to love this phone.Thank you John Chen! Keep it up BlackBerry!",2014年12月10日 在美国审核

Awesome!!!,"The BlackBerry Passport is not like the Blackberrys of the past.The device is stunning and, obviously, different in design from just about any other phone on the market.The screen is vibrant and visible in all lighting conditions.The keyboard is excellent and personally, I had no issue getting used to the combination of physical keys and context dependent virtual keys.I have large hands and I can use the device one handed to type a message.For small hands, this is definitely a two handed device.The BB10 software works smoothly and I had no problem setting up my various accounts.BB Hub is awesome.But back to the device... You will love the screen for anything but movies. Module to the design (square), movies and YouTube videos have a good chunk of the screen real estate taken up by black bars.The video is still clearly visible, but one would obviously like it use the whole screen, which is not possible.Aside from that, for anything else like emails, browsing, document editing... The screen design is fantastic.The keyboard has touch sensors which allow you to swipe your fingers across the keys for various tasks, including scrolling, so less greasy prints on the glass.If you are an enterprise user or even a standard consumer whose primary goal is not to watch movies, and you like the idea of a hardware keyboard, this Blackberry is worth a look.They come in black (which was too boring for me), red/black (which is what I opted for) and white.Additionally, there is now a silver edition which differes only in the materials used for the shell, some rounded corners, some grippier back panel, stainless frame but contains the exact same guts.I found the one I purchased sturdy enough, no flex, does not feel cheap, so the extra money was not worth it for me.",2014年9月26日 在美国审核
It shrinks on you,"The Passport is really wide and that means you have use it differently than a small candy bar phone, like no more texting in traffic like I did with my Z10. After a few days, I began to touch type without looking at the keys and the old phone now seems small.Web browsing is vastly superior to anything out there. Full desktop sites are no longer painful to use. Scrolling, pinching and zooming is greatly reduced. Filling out online forms is much easier and entering passwords is a breeze.Make no mistake, this is a radically different design that has the keyboard old school BlackBerry fans love, but blends it with a virtual screen for numbers, punctuation and symbols. It's like the difference between a classic and modern VW Beetle, the modern Beetle being both familiar in form, but thoroughly modern, and to the dead-ender fans of the classic: polarizing.I really wasn't so sure I wanted to keep the phone on day one. The Z10 is a very good typing experience for a virtual keyboard. After a few days, I am over the hump on the learning curve and discovering new features everyday, and find myself using my phone at more appropriate times and in more appropriate ways.UPDATE: I have been using my Passport for over 7 months now and it gets better with age. My partner recently bought an iPhone 6+, because he was quite jealous of t:he big screen of my Passport, but would never switch to BlackBerry. We went away for a weekend and he forget his phone at home, so he had to quickly learn how to use my Passport. The biggest stumbling block for him was the lack of a home button. But forced to learn, he did and realized that the Passport can do almost anything an iPhone 6+ can, but in some cases, tasks can be done in fewer moves (more efficiently). At work, I am often called on, by my less tech savvy co-workers, to call up tech bulletins, which are easy to read on the Passport. Samsung and iPhone users alike, agree that the Passport display is easier to read. They ask, is that a minature laptop?Well, practically, that's what it is. If the iPhone 6+ is an iPad replacement, the Passport is a laptop replacement. Different stroke for different folks, but I can tell you from experience that iPhone and Samsung users alike are wowed by the Passport when properly exposed to it in the real world.",2014年10月30日 在美国审核
Best phone ever with a unique design,"I've been a BlackBerry user for four years (Torch 9800, Bold 9900, Q10, and Passport). I admit I can never type as fast as I did with my Bold but combining the gesture swipe for typing, the much larger screen, the productive OS etc makes everything better.BB10 OS is just amazing and you won't turn back to whatever other OS after using this (except for those who do not explore their phone and choose to keep everything EXTREMELY simple as BB10 OS has a bit of a learning curve).I never find this phone awkward to carry, in fact I think it looks elegant. Stainless steel frame looks cool and it's pretty much scratch free, and the Gorilla glass gives the screen extra protection too. The downside though is the material of the back...it seems to get scratches easily (don't have any yet so far given my extremely good care).Battery life is extreme. I did not expect too much given its large LCD screen with high resolution, but it turns out to last even longer than my Q10, which has a small LED screen.Highly recommended for those who don't just use their phone for gaming or watching videos!!! Best phone ever used",2014年11月6日 在美国审核
The Amazing Passport,"I've been using Android and Apple products for a while after parting from my Bold 9700 back in those days... When BB10 came out I tried the Z10 and got used to the Hub, unique gestures and UX in a very short time (I would say hours). Immediately I fell in love with the productivity and how fast I could get things done (for business and personal consume as well). Unfortunately I had to go to work to another country and left my Z10 behind and got a brand new N5.It was pretty weird that I was trying to swipe to get into the hub using my N5 and that's when I realized that I had to go back to opening each app in order to see all my notifications/emails/messages. A couple of months passed and the Z30 came out and I decided to give it a test run since I was very disappointed in my N5 (battery life, lag, minimum security and with google now monitoring every step and email, I was concerned with my privacy)...Z30 came in and I was blown away with the speed and the changes that the OS went through since I used my Z10 with 10.1. Android functionality was improved and app gap was not that painful since I could find everything I needed and with a top notch browser I could open the mobile/desktop site without problems.BlackBerry's virtual keyboard is the best you can find out there, specially being able to speak 3 languages fluently I could configure it so it can show predictions for all three at the same time without having to change the language setting. Months using my Z30 and following up with the community on the development progress on the OS and apps I found myself not needing any other device and gave away my N5 to a dear friend wanting to switch from the Apple world.Long story short, Passport came out and at first was a little concerned about going back to a physical keyboard, while having the best virtual keyboard around and the odd square shape... But let me tell you, this device is the best I've ever owned! Hi end specs with a well polished OS makes it a very smooth experience. Android runtime is faster than ever and every app I've needed that's not in BlackBerry World could be installed using several markets available.Keyboard and screen is amazing and once you get used to the square size you will never ever go back to a rectangular phone (there's no point, you can barely see anything). And last but not least, my favorite feature: Blackberry Blend! Aren't you tired of transferring files through USB or sending yourself emails (yes, sometimes we have to)... Well, I was! Blend makes it easy for me to manage my phone wherever I am in a secure and seamless way and with no worries that my data will remain in an insecure device.The only thing I hate about it, is that sometimes it has died on me since I forget I need to charge it (after a couple of days of heavy use) :), but that's a good problem to have! And as JC would say, everybody want's to touch/see your phone lol",2014年12月5日 在美国审核
Can't imagine using another phone now,"Have to say I can't imagine using another phone now after buying this one. I'm completely spoiled by the screen and once I got the hang of typing on a keyboard again (took about two weeks) I'm back up to speed. Good battery life and very stable so far. Yes you will need two hands to use this phone to type, but that's ok with me. It's been replacing my Kindle too now that it's much easier to read on the bigger screen! I did notice not all Android games run on 10.3 but all the Android apps I need run on it, so really no complaints.Pretty much able to grab anything I need between the BB store, Amazon store, and Snap.I am glad I got it. Sorry I'm not going to rant and compare to other phones- it's really not like anything else out there! The Hub rocks on this thing. I love the multitude of Browser windows I can have open at a time. It's really more like a small pc than a phone to me.",2014年12月16日 在美国审核
Blackberry is not dead. Best phone I've ever owned.,"The very best, hands-down, phone I have ever owned. Read the other reviews for specifics and don't buy into the ignorant 'blackberry is backward and dead' silliness that abounds for some reason. I've owned handsets from many manufacturers on every major platform (iOS, Windows Mobile and Android) and BB10 is the the most intuitive there is. 80-90 % of all the Android apps I've loaded on this thing run without a hitch (look into Cobalt's Android patch for FULL Google Play Store functionality) be it via Snap or the Amazon app store. Blackberry World still has apps that are absolutely excellent as well, even a Sonos app that works as good or better than the 'official' Android version.Can't say enough how much I love this dang phone.Update 2017/06/14: I am sad to say I am moving to a KeyONE because there are just a couple apps I need access to that the developers no longer allow on the Android Runtime version (becoming more and more deprecated) available on the Passport SE. This is a shame because for ALL OTHER INTENTS AND PURPOSES this handset device is still the very greatest, fastest, most robust, just joy-to-use smartphone I have ever owned, still. I will keep this thing around for travel-purposes absolutely, when all I need is text/voice/email. It is very sad that this device did not and never will receive the appreciation it deserves. I hope the KeyONE can measure half of this phone's value. I've used many an Android handset, a Windows device, and two iPhones to date - this Blackberry Passport SE put them all to dead shame.",2016年1月23日 在美国审核

"Great phone, for what it is oriented to","The phone is a little heavy and big, but for what it is suppose to do it's great: A business oriented tool, with long lasting battery, beautiful and useful display, great keyboard and excellent OS. If you are looking for a multimedia/camera oriented device, this is not going to appeal you, but if you care less for that and more to write emails, docs, check twitter, IM (BBM or Whatsapp), and internet surf, look no further. This phone has the potential to last (at least to me) for good couple of years. In Venezuela, with Movistar, it does 4G very well.Look for a good case, there are not a large selection but https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P8YU6OS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 does it reasonably well.",2015年4月28日 在美国审核

There are differences to get use to but I have found them very easy to become accustomed to. I got a 128GB memory card and have my 15000+ song library loaded.

Had to write this review on my new passport.,"After three days of using this device coming from a Galaxy note 3, I have to say it grows on you. After buying the device to get a last look at BlackBerry before the upcoming rumored android device, I slowly started to get used to the strange form factor and the gestures in the OS which felt weird at first. This this is a serious device for serious people. Sideload 'snap' for your android apps like instagram, facebook and so on. Snapchat is currently not working, which is a bummer but I use my tablet for that. If you are like me and did your research after feeling bored with android (I've been using android nonstop since about 2007) just give this device a week test run and you will see why so many people, including myself love it.",2015年9月24日 在美国审核
Work WIDE!,"I had my eye on the BlackBerry Passport since its release in September.I'm an AT&amp;T customer and was hoping to get the device from them when they released it.Fast forward two months later and still no word from AT&amp;T on a release, but BlackBerry had slashed the price to $499 for Black Friday and I went ahead and pulled the trigger.I will go ahead and say that I'm a huge BlackBerry fan and when I first saw images of the Passport, I thought it was a hideous device.It was this huge square phone with this awkward looking three-row keyboard.The phone looked extremely wide and like something unwieldy.As video reviews came out and size comparisons to other popular phones, I grew more intrigued by its weird shape and keyboard.Let's start with the BB10 as a whole.I'm used the the OS because I've owned the Z10, Q10 and most recently the Z30.BlackBerry 10 is a gesture based operating system that has grown beautifully since its first iteration almost two years ago.I have access to apps from BlackBerry world as well as android applications directly from Amazon App Store or anywhere I can download .apk files from (websites, 1mobile market, etc.).I can also side load an application called ""Snap"" to install applications directly from the Google Play store.Of course the use of android applications can be hit or miss, I've found that most apps I use work just as well as native applications.I use Beats Music, Soundcloud, Instagram, Netflix and Hulu religiously and all work well with the Passport.With this being said, if you are a huge user of Google applications that require Google services, this may not be the device for you.There are workarounds if you are so inclined to try them, but if you don't want to do the work or use an alternative application, stick to what you know.Next, the physical size of the Passport.This phone is big.I have larger hands for a female and I find it quite comfortable to use with two hands.It takes some getting used to, but the phone is really not that bad after a few weeks of use.I've had it for about a week now and I have adjust well coming from an all touch screen device.The phone on the heavier side for a smartphone, but it's not like I'm carrying around a brick or doing hard labor.It feels solid and if I drop it (knock on wood) I don't feel like it'll be greatly damaged.I rarely carry a purse, so when people see me they always ask, ""Can you even fit that thing in your pocket?!"" The answer is YES!I wear a lot of dress pants for work and I can fit the phone securely into a front pocket.It's not as bad as I thought it would be before I got the phone in hand.Also, I work out and usually listen to music.There isn't a armband or pocket that this phone works well with, but I did find the Flipbelt on Amazon and it works ridiculously well.Let's talk about this keyboard.In one word, it's AMAZING!I was leery when I first saw that there were only three rows of keys on the phone, but after using it...it just makes sense.You get numbers and punctuation on screen depending on what your needs are.The kicker is that the keyboard is touch sensitive.With the word suggestion built into BB10, you can swipe up suggested words as you would on a Z10, Z30 or Z3.It felt familiar coming from a Z30 to the Passport.It gives you a few options to type and does help when using the phone single handed.The keyboard also allows for you to swipe through lists, websites, etc. which is great because you can utilize the entire screen for viewing and not reading around your scrolling finger.The last thing that takes this phone to the next level is the use of BlackBerry Blend.Blend allows you to connect to your Passport via USB, wireless network or mobile network from you laptop, iPad or Android tablet.You have full access to your files, emails, texts, and BBM groups and individual texts from you laptop or tablet.This is an amazing feature for work!I can view incoming messages from my laptop and send a reply without having multiple emails open in my browser.I can attach files from my computer or phone into an email and send it off without missing a beat.Blend is exclusive to the Passport and Porsche designed phones, and will be available to other BB10 phones in the near future.All in all, if you're willing to WORK WIDE, I would recommend this phone to you without a doubt.It just works really well.If you're all in with an Android or iPhone ecosystem this may not be the phone for you and that's okay.",2014年12月4日 在美国审核

The battery life is better than any phone I have had before and the sound quality, both speaking on the phone and audio from listening to music is great. the phone fits perfect in my pockets and is not as heavy as you might think. the phone is blazing fastand I have found all the applications I need inside the Amazon app store. one other thing I want to mention is I thought the phone would be top heavy when you are typing and that is not the case.

Best phone I've ever had.,"By far the best phone I have ever used. I've never owned a Blackberry before so I'm not a Blackberry fanboy, I've used the Windows phone did not care for it so I went back to Android, I grew tired of the slow downs and freezing that I got on every Android phone I've ever used and the worry over my battery dying if I used my phone for more than 5 minutes. Let me say right now with the Blackberry Passport I no longer have any of them worries. This phone never slows down, I can have 10 things running at once and this phone just keeps going, part of that is due to the amazing hardware that was put into the Passport but also Blackberry 10 OS is by far the best smartphone OS there is right now.As for apps, that is no longer a problem, there is not an app yet I have not found between Blackberry app world, Amazon app store, and Snap ""Google play store"", if apps is what you want, the Passport is just as good as any Android/Apple phone.I have missed having a physical keyboard for years and the Passports is the best I've ever used. it's way more than just a keyboard, you can scroll, delete words with just a swipe, and many other functions, I'm still learning everything this keyboard can do. You hardly have to touch the screen at all.Now onto one of the best reasons to own this phone, the battery. You just can't kill this phone, I like to wake up in the morning and check my emails, texts, and websites on my phone while relaxing in bed and I don't want to be hooked on a cord, the Passport let's me do that, I love being able to be on my phone, get online, make calls and text, and play a game on my lunch break and still have 50% battery left when I get home, it's amazing, I've never owned a phone in my life that does everything this phone does and not die.The screen on it is also amazing for being online, websites are great on this phone. I also find games and Netflix look great on this phone. I plan on keeping and using my Passport for a long time to come, I don't think I could ever go back to the slowness of Android or poor battery life. Plus I have fell in love with this keyboard.",2015年3月10日 在美国审核
It is the best you can find.,"Well, if you are looking for a unique device, it is the best you can find. It's drawing everyone's attention.Main benefits: extremely high quality reception, speakers (both ear and external), extreme quality of microphones (All 4 of them), you can actually place your BB Passport on a conference table and it will be sufficient for up to 10 participants because it has such a great microphone and call quality and obviously such loud speakers. So if you are a business oriented person who is looking for a work phone, this is no doubt the best, I've tried them all (iOS, Android &amp; WP8). The software is great and easy to use, swipes are great, it's very fast, no lags. The Android apps run mostly flawlessly. I installed some Android apps (via SNAP &amp; Amazon), they work just like on my Android, sometimes even faster. The downside is getting used to the size of this phone and getting used to type on a physical keyboard after almost 3 years on virtual keyboard (before that I had a BB 9900, 9700 and Nokia E71 &amp; E72). Regarding speed of typing, I think Swipe for virtual keyboard could be faster or maybe the same speed, but for some people (such as myself) it is more comfortable to type on those physical keyboards and get the feedback of a real button.I am still arguing with myself which is better (virtual vs physical). The battery is huge but only lasts for a day of business use (lots of phone calls and mail reading), which is no doubt a software issue because I had an Android with similar specs and smaller battery that lasted for 2 days. So it is good enough but battery could be better. That's what I really liked about my old BB 9700, the battery lasted 3 days. Anyway, this is a super high quality premium device, I am very happy with it. It's not the average 5"" smartphone and that what makes it unique. If you are business/productivity oriented, get this phone ASAP. Remember it takes time to get used to the keyboard, it's worth it. This is the ONLY real premium device on the market right now that actually focuses on call quality (somehow, most vendors forgot about it). It just feels right. I am using it for almost 2 months now.",2014年11月26日 在美国审核

The Blackberry Passport Rocks!,"I have been a Blackberry user since the Curve first came out. After the Curve, I had the first generation Bold and then the Bold 9930. The Passport is, by far, the best cell phone I have ever used. That, plus leaving Verizon Wireless after over 25 years and going to AT&amp;T, has given me the best cell phone experience. It took a few days for me to get used to the new keyboard, primarily because the function keys are at the bottom of touch screen. My typing is as fast, maybe faster, than it was on the Bold. So long as I can use a Blackberry, I will stay a Blackberry user. I love their phones.I have had my Blackberry Passport for over five months and am still very happy with it. I suspect some of my pleasure is because my service provider is AT&amp;T instead of Verizon Wireless. I want to thank Miriam at the AT&amp;T store on Atlantic Avenue in Bixby Knolls, Long Beach, California for sharing her outstanding knowledge whenever I have a question or need a solution. Even though I am unable to upload Uber to my phone, I continue to feel that the Blackberry Passport Rocks. Uber will eventually realize loyal BB users will also be loyal Uber users and develop software that will work for the Passport. In the meantime, choosing my Passport over software like Uber is a no-brainer. The Passport will always win. Thanks Blackberry and AT&amp;T!",2015年2月7日 在美国审核
"Once you go BlackBerry, you never go back (Ha) (Was an Android User)","I was weary about this phone as I never had a BlackBerry because of compatibility and their popularity was so low. I finally just bought it as I was a fan of the keyboard and the size, and I am not regretting it. The screen has so much real estate for being a 4.5 inch screen 1:1 ratio. I have text set to small so I get the maximum amount of text and detail.I am not phone gamer: I use my phone for calling, texting, facebook, browsing the web, and running numerous apps to print stuff from my phone, maybe play temple run or candy crush. This phone rocks at running all the apps from my Android Phone. I installed Snap (the google play store) and it was a breeze. Most Android apps run great and have no problems. Minecraft did lag a little, but it was easier to play as soon as it loaded.Battery life? Well, I have been off the charger since 7:00 AM, and it is now exactly 5:00 PM and I have 79% left on my charge. This is with heavy use... Web browsing, calling, texting, and playing music via bluetooth in my car.Size? Fits better in my pocket than my LG G3 did. It is no as long, but it is wide. The wideness does not bother my pockets and I wear skinny jeans.Weight? Feels great in the hands. This phone screams quality.If you love apps and flag ship android phones, then this is for you if you want a physical keyboard. The screen is smaller for, say, hulu and netflix. But this is why I have a laptop...Did I mention this phone is FAST? I do not know why people had problems with it being slow. As soon as I turned it on I updated the software, and the camera opens instantly and the phone never bogs down. BLACKBERRY BLEND IS AWESOME!! I can view my texts from my Laptop!Overall...

As good as it gets,"The second BB10 devices hit the market I ditched Apple, and headed back to the company that invented the smartphone; I have never looked back. After using BB10 for a few days IOS is painful to use, and feels like a step backward in technology. This phone is taking BlackBerry, and smartphones in general to an entirely new level. The Passport is a fusion of the all-touch, physical keyboard, and phablet smartphones of today. The ability to work and play with this phone is beyond comprehension.Recently I toured Europe with a few friends. We spent days taking pictures with our smartphones (all types present), and nights comparing our archive of the day. Each of my pals were embarrased day in and day out to show the photos on their phones after looking at the photos my Passport captured.The ""App Gap"" is a distant memory with three app stores readily available on BB10 devices.Amazon App Store and BlackBerry World come stock on the Passport, and Google Play can easily be added.I'm not sure what else to say. Stop being a brain-washed zombie, and buy the very best phone on the market today. Prepare to amaze your friends and coworkers with the easily accessible amazing features built in to the BlackBerry OS. You will not regret this purchase.",2014年12月5日 在美国审核
an effective business tool,"Overall here's my take (written from the blackberry itself)1) the PIM (email, calendar, etc) integration in the Hub application is peerless. It works flawlessly with a wide variety of platforms including exchange, imap accounts, icloud, and google services. synchronization across platforms is easy to setup up and works seamlessly. There is nothing on the market which works better than this currently IMHO. It outclassed my galaxy note in this respect, which seemed like more of an unstable hack job when it came to PIM integration2) integration of the filesystem with dropbox and onedrive is effective and seamless for nearly all apps, essentially bringing the cloud to apps that were not specifically designed for cloud use. This greatly enhances the business potential of the device.3) the android implementation, particularly regarding interface consistency and input methods could use work. Particularly problematic is the inconsistent implementation of the keyboard touchpad in applications. In some android apps like citrix receiver, the touchpad tries to move the cursor even when typing, rendering the app compleletly useless. Additionally key mapping is off in some android apps, taking the backspace to a 'delete' function instead. Otherwise android apps like firefox, chrome, and opera worked surprisingly well on this device. The new os 10.3.1 may address some of the android interface issues.4) multimedia: the audio player can play audiophile 192hz/24bit flac files natively. The native DLNA implementation works surprisingly well, allowing it to be a media server for playstaion there was hardly any battery drain after serving 1080p movies to a ps3 for a couple of hours.5) size: it takes up less space than my iPhone 5 with mophie helium battery pack, yet the battery lasts longer than those two combined.",2014年11月25日 在美国审核

This phone makes life much easier and should put Blackberry back up on the map!  Mark my words.,"VERIFIED BUYER. I have had been using this phone for 12 days and figured the honeymoon has ended already with this phone and it was time to write a review.*** Take this review with bias as I am a hardcore Blackberry enthusiast and am just going to talk about the hardware***If you have used Blackberry phones in the past, then please read on as I will compare it to older models.I will NOT cover the apps and compare and contrast it versus an Iphone or Android.Different strokes for different folks and if you love those operating systems then stick with them.I personally have tried them all and think the Blackberry OS10 is the best of them out there when it comes to productivity.So for the purpose of brevity,I will just stick to reviewing the hardware.I've been using Blackberry phones since 2008 and have been through eight (8) different Blackberry models (and several high end Sony Android phones in between for experimentation)I'm a text messaging +email monster.Probably type 3,000-4,000 words per day.Currently coming from Blackberry Q10.I always carry two phones on me:one for personal and one for my business.Now my two go-to phones are my new Passport (personal) and Q10 (business).To be honest, the day I got my Passport delivered in the mail it was both a happy and sad day for me.It was like breaking up with your current boyfriend/girlfriend because you were moving on to something better in life, as selfish as it seems.You know, the feeling of: 'OH geez, I got to take time out and learn how to use this new phone now when I already mastered my current phone and can get everything done with it.The Q10 did me really good, it was fast and efficient and I was a speed demon on the keyboard crunching out emails and texts all day long.But WOW, since I switched to Passport I am never looking back, as cliche and cheesy as it may sound it is the best way I can describe the feeling.Enter:Passport.First impression, the screen size and clarity.Damn, what a huge improvement.Is it a little wide?Perhaps, 1 centimeter too wide.You can definitely hold it in one hand comfortably and use your other hand's thumb/index finger to scroll and navigate your way on the screen.But yes, it does take two hands on the steering wheel to navigate and crunch out texts and emails, properly.Yes, it does fit in your front pocket.It might not fit into a girls tight jeans, but I'm a dude who wears jeans that are fitted and it does fit in my front pocket nicely.However, it is tricky taking out of your pocket.And you have to allocate one pocket for the sole purpose of carrying the Passport.It took me a few days to get used to the new keyboard layout.Yes, the space bar could be a little wider (half a centimeter?) and it is kind of weird at first that it is placed in between the V and the B.The keyboard is Blackberry's best yet.The keys are nice and fat and have a satisfying 'crunch' to them upon pressing.I'm lazy and dislike learning curves but the Passport was really easy to get acclimated into.I had lots of trouble switching from my Bold 9900 (a classic!) to the Q10, mainly because of the absence of a physical toolbelt: call key, menu key, trackpad, and back button.This Passport keyboard which also acts as a track pad and cursor is some hi-tech stuff!With the flick technology, I'm even faster on my text messages and emails now.With the Q10, your thumb had to jump off of the keyboard to press the predictive text if you wanted to select it.With the Passport it's literally just a 'flick' motion upwards while your thumbs are still on the keyboard and you are aware of its position at all times.Life is much easier.The steel bezel frame that surrounds the phone looks/feels top notch and professional.The phone feels very sturdy in general.No squeaks, creaks, or funny noises from crappy plastic rubbing up against each other when you hold the phone (or even bend it).The phone's balance is nice and the weight is just right for me.I was a bit concerned about the phone feeling off balance when it came to texting since the keyboard only covers only 1/4 of the whole front of the phone.No problem, there at all.My three middle fingers on the back of the phone, my two pinky fingers on the base of the phone for stabilization, and my two thumbs on the keyboard, and my hands are in a comfortable and natural position. The phone is thin, but not to my liking. I do hope Otterbox will step up and make a case for it.I'm used to holding on to my Blackberry phones with some girth for grip.Overall improvements:1.) much better camera than predecessors, much more responsive and auto-focus is spot on.2.) Speakers have improved drastically. Loud and clear sound coming out of two ports from the bottom.3.)Hot swap access to expandable storage is convenient.I put a 64gb on mines.This phone will automatically format it for you.4.) HUGE battery improvement.The stories are true, you can go 2 days on moderate use without charging the phone.Overall complaint on the phone:1.) They could have used some other material on the back. It is pretty junky.While the rubber is nice for gripping the phone, it does get scratched and marred very easily.The glass weave on the Q10 is much nicer.And since the non-removable battery covers 90% of the rubber backing, I'm sure this will be one big gripe on this phone's hardware from customersSummary: Extremely, very happy with the Passport.When reverting back to my Q10 during business hours, I sometimes laugh in my own head thinking:how the hell could have gotten by using this tiny ass screen and keyboard?I seriously do have trouble using the keyboard on the Q10 now.It just seems awkward,now that I'm use to the Passport.I'm sure you'll feel the same way.I know the Blackberry Classic is coming out and has answered it's loyal Blackberry users by bringing back the physical key toolbelt, but I'm not sure I can revert to a smaller screen other than the one I'm looking at right now!",2014年11月4日 在美国审核

The Best Smartphone Phone I Have Ever Used?,"Perhaps the best phone that I have used. Switched from the Note 4, and not looking back. Physical keys take a bit of getting used to, I'm slightly slower but more accurate after 2 weeks, so its a wash. Battery life is great, I don't get 2 days but I typically go from 6am-11pm and end with 20% battery, the note would be done by 7pm, but then again I am a heavy user. All the apps I use including most of the google services work, or have a sufficient work around. Games are fine, and the phone powers through with no problem. Camera can't match the Note 4, but currently no phone can, that being said the passport camera is okay. Ergonomically, the phone feels great, I can type with one hand, but I have big hands. Emails, news articles, spreadsheets, and docs, all look great. Movies, magazines, and heavier games are okay, but I have an Nvidia tablet for those. Overall great phone! Not for everyone, but those that need productivity with a side of leisure this is your phone.",2015年2月25日 在美国审核
but phone calls really do sound better on this phone,"I used this phone around the house on WiFi for a month before my Verizon contract expired, and I've had it connected through AT&amp;T for a week now.I thought the descriptions of ""superior phone call quality"" sounded a little gimmicky, but phone calls really do sound better on this phone.The phone construction is excellent.It looks top-end, and it feels very sturdy and high quality, much more durable than the phone I was replacing (a Samsung Galaxy S5).The OS takes some getting used to, but it feels natural after only a short time using it as my primary phone.I must say, application options are far more limited than with Android or Apple, but I used Cobalt's app (available by Google search) to add Google Play Store to the device.I'm now able to access and run 90 percent of the Android apps I want, with the notable exceptions of Whatsapp and Snapchat.The BlackBerry Assistant is quite handy and effective at setting calendar reminders, timers, alarms, and other tasks.The voice recognition ability is pretty good, but I do believe it gets some of my dictation wrong more frequently than Android did.No worries on that, there will be tradeoffs, and I am really happy with the quality and usability of this phone.Battery life is quite good, better than I am used to for sure.The wide screen is great for reading the news and emails.The keyboard is great to have again, and the touch sensitivity feature allows me to scroll through sites and documents without my finger on the screen obstructing my view.I know I should deduct a star for the only shortcoming--the limited number of apps designed to work on the phone, but I left the rating at 5 stars because I knew that before I ordered it, and every other feature has exceeded my expectations, even coming from a high-market competitor like Samsung.",2016年10月28日 在美国审核
You'll have to pry my QWERTY from my cold dead hands.,"Why did I spend an exorbitant amount for something clunky and awkward to use?Something with a limited App store and heavy enough to use as a paperweight?Because I email and text a lot, and that glorious keyboard allows me to do both, quickly and happily.I live in New York, so I do need something for music and podcasts on the subway; therefore I have my ""fun device"" (my iPod touch, which I use to Instagram and stream Netflix and radio), and my ""work device"" (the Passport, which I use for answering email, edit word docs, review pdfs, and the like).I know this setup wouldn't work for others, and I wouldn't recommend the Passport if you are only planning on lugging one device.But It works well for me.Oh, the battery life also puts the iPod to shame.",2015年3月2日 在美国审核
Almost Perfect,"I would give it a 5 star, but this is an honest review. 1. The size is perfect, you will get used to its strange shape. It will fit in your pocket2. The interactive physical keyboard is the best. 3. Slide gestures are superior. 4. The notifications hub is very intuitive and productive. All your notifications: email, texts, phone calls, twitter, facebook, etc are here. No need to hunt down an icon. 5. Phone call quality is excellent. 6. Speakers are awesome. 7. Unique. 8. Screen resolution is second to none, crystal clear and large. 9. Battery longevity is phenomenons. Apple should be embarrassed with the iPhones crap battery.Bad: the camera takes excellent photos under the right condition. it takes entirely too long to focus on a subject, especially when moving. This is suppose to be fixed with the next os update. Occasional screen flicker. Again fixed in next os release. Google services doesn't quite work well. There are sideloading steps you can take, but it should be standard. If you are looking for the itunes plethra of apps, go buy an iPhone. But, this isn't a huge deal for me as I have more important things to do than play 90 versions of angry birds.Blackberry could once again compete in the smart phone industr, but they need to listen to the customers more and not roll out os that are not quite perfected.",2014年12月28日 在美国审核
"In a word, ""Wow""","When you open the box your first reaction is oh my God is that thing big!It is.If you have an American (or most other nation) passport, go get it.That's the size of the phone, almost to the millimeter.It's substantial.Neither light or ridiculously heavy, and reasonably svelte.Unlike many devices these days the body has an outside metal band that appears to be stainless steel, punctuated with the charging connector on the bottom, the volume and mute keys on the right, and the power button and headphone jack on the top.The rear surface is a lightly-rubberized plastic and soft to the touch, providing a good gripping surface.The rear of the phone sports a flush camera (it does not stick out, unlike the new iPhones) while the face is taken up by the screen and...... a keyboard.Up top a small cover comes off (at the center top there is a small notch for a fingernail to be used) to reveal the nano-sim and SD-card slot.The battery is enormous but not directly replaceable (although the unit has been disassembled at this point by some and it appears to be reasonably serviceable -- which is nice.)Will it fit in your pocket?Yes, as will an actual passport.Unless you wear those ridiculous skin-tight jeans that won't fit a proper-sized wallet, you're fine.The standard pair of men's Levis swallows the phone in the front pocket without complaint.So does a pair of dress pants, or (of course) a suit jacket pocket, which is where you would typically keep your passport when traveling. The bound paper one, that is.I swapped my T-Mobile account to a nano-SIM (the Z10 takes a micro), popped in the 64GB SD card that I had in my Z10, then powered it up.My first impression on going through the setup and mandatory quick tutorials -- which now include teaching you how to use the touch-sensitive keyboard (yes, it works like a trackpad as well as a keyboard!) revealed that this device is smoking fast and the screen is simply gorgeous.Colors are vibrant, clean and the resolution is outstanding.Not wanting to screw the software up I elected to set it up from scratch rather than attempt to port over my most-recent backup from the Z10 -- which I might have been able to accomplish, but it wasn't worth the risk.First things first -- I used Sachesi to load SNAP, so I could easily get the Android apps I had on the Z10 back, then went into BlackBerry World, signed in and it transferred my credentials over.All my previous purchased apps from the Z10 were available and I narfed them, setting up my folders as I had previously.The task of telling the phone where to find my calendars, contact database and such was then upon me, along with re-setting all the customizations for various people I communicate with (custom ring tones, etc.)The entire process, and remember that I'm migrating from a Z10 I've used for the last year and a half (with all the data and apps you might expect I'd have over that time!) took about an hour to complete.Note that I keep my calendars and contact database on my infrastructure -- the Passport will talk to Google's systems among others, but then Google has your calendar and contact database.No thank you; I will run my own over an encrypted link, and BB10 devices support that with minimal hassle in setup.It was during this process that I discovered that this phone has one hell of a pair of stereo speakers in the bottom bezel.You won't be playing concert halls with it, but it's very unlike what you think of as a ""phone"".The sound is loud, clear, and has surprisingly good definition for coming from that tiny little case.This augurs well for those who want to use the phone as a speakerphone for small groups -- good (and acceptably loud) speakers are, of course, a big part of being able to do that.The keyboard took only minutes to become acclimated to -- I'm fast and more-importantly, accurate with it.I've never been a fan of physical keyboards other than ""sliders"" as I have been unwilling to give up the screen real estate, but this implementation won me over quickly.Being able to swipe backward across the keys to perform a backwards word delete, for example, is one of many intuitive touches that just plain works.I thought the context soft keys above the physical keyboard would be a gimmicky pain in the butt, but they're not.It's much faster to use than on-screen ""soft"" keyboards -- even the really nice-working ones as are found in the more-modern smartphones like the Z10, Swype on Android devices and similar.In short the keyboard is a winner -- a big winner if you actually type things.The phone has 3Gb of system RAM along with 32Gb of device flash storage, and has no problems with keeping multiple things going at once.Should you wish to have more (and you should for music, video, picture and similar storage) an SD card of up to 128Gb can be used.Note that for cards larger than 32Gb the phone downloads (on first use) a driver for exFAT; on first boot my Passport wanted to grab a software update and refused to load that SD card driver until it completed, which took a few minutes.But as soon as the update completed and I allowed it to reboot (it was polite enough to ask and allow me to defer until it was convenient) it all was good from there.Cold boot time for this device is quite short.I measured 55 seconds from pressing the power button with an ""off"" phone until the lock screen was displayed.That's exemplary -- and a lot faster than previous BB10 devices.But -- there's no real reason to shut the phone off; I've not had a crash on a BB10 device since the very early 10.0 days roughly 18 months ago....About this time into my use I started to find surprises in the new hardware and software combination -- all good.First, in Android apps if you swipe down from the top you'll see a ""Zoom out"" option.If you choose it the unit will resize for the full screen resolution instead of a ""clipped"" phone-style Android app size, and tell the app it has the full resolution available.Some apps will go into tablet mode when you do this -- which is really, really nice.Think trading apps, for example (e.g. ThinkOrSwim), or the Kindle e-book reader.Speaking of which the Passport works exceptionally well for that application, should you be into book-reading.Next, a double-finger swipe down on the physical keyboard brings up a full virtual keyboard (above the physical) complete with all the symbols, and a second double-finger swipe changes to a second set of symbols.A third dismisses it.Very handy.The BlackBerry ""signature"" multicolor LED on the front is present; get the BlackBerry App BeBuzz Pro for greatly enhanced capability in this regard.To give you some sort of idea what I do with it I have two contacts (my daughter and g/f) that have their own ""colors"" -- yellow and pink -- that I have blinking for any sort of message (email, facebook, text, missed call etc) from them.Thus if I have anything pending from them (unseen) I know instantly without having to wake up the phone.For unread general texts, the LED blinks green, for emails blue.Then there are patterns I have set for missed calls (red/blue) and there's another one for no Internet connectivity (e.g. in an area with a crap signal) -- red/red.As a result I know the status of the device at a glance, and what if anything I haven't seen.This is one of those features that Apple has never figured out the need for, and while some Android devices have it, not all do.I consider it essential after having had it for the last couple of years and would never buy a device without it.The BB10 ""bedside mode"" is another nice feature; your phone is your alarm clock.We all charge our phones at night, yes?So buy a little stand for your bedside table, plug in there, and pull down the top menu -- you get ""bedside mode.""The screen appropriately dims way down to red so your eyeballs don't get blasted out and adjusts for the room light (or more to the point, the lack thereof.) You can set this to allow phone calls (and only phone calls!) to ring through or silence all alerts while in that mode.Alarms are of course supported as well (what good is a clock without an alarm, and of course you can wake to any music from your collection.)Now you have a travel alarm clock that really works (including snooze) that is your primary clock, both home and away.Excellent.Note that in 10.3.1 firmware, which I have on my Z10 but is not yet available for the Passport, notification profiles can be radically customized for any mode -- including this one, so if there are people who you must hear from irrespective of when you can tell it to do that.This is one of those little BlackBerry features that has replaced a device I used to have both in my home and when traveling -- the old mundane clock.One ""random"" note -- if you're one of those people who texts in the car while driving (and you know damn well you shouldn't) I will tell you right now -- don't get this phone.It is very difficult to operate one-handed, especially for entering text.So if you're hellbent on trying to kill yourself or others by being distracted while driving this phone isn't for you.On the other hand in an airvent clip holder as a GPS device the Passport is incredible.The screen is very crisp, brightness auto-adjusts nicely (as do the other BB10 devices; BlackBerry got this right on the entire line) and overall it's a great user experience.Mireo works well also if you have purchased it (offline nav with maps on your SD card or in device memory.)Want Google's maps?Yes, that works -- you can't sign in (since BlackBerry doesn't formally support Google Play) but the navigation portion is fully functional.Just remember that whenever those apps are running you're giving your location, direction of travel, speed and identity to both the company involved (e.g. Google) and the NSA.If you'd like some privacy pony up the few bucks for Mireo, but in using it rather than BlackBerry's (or Google's) mapping app you will give up active traffic (e.g. wrecks, etc) avoidance.Now let's talk about BlackBerry Blend.It only works at present on the Passport, and it's a game-changer.It connects over WiFi, cellular data or USB (your choice of any or all.)You load an app on your desktop, laptop and/or tablet; when activated it mirrors your phone messaging and calendar screens on your computer.When you get a message, email, BBM, anything -- you have it available on your computer, which means your phone can remain in your pocket all the time when you're at your desk, especially if you have a bluetooth headset to take a phone call.Oh, and did I mention that the file manager is available from Blend, so you can copy files to and from the phone, including from your linked cloud accounts such as Dropbox, Box and even your PC or Mac if you set that up via Link as well?The exceptions are that the Twitter and Facebook clients don't mirror.I also am not terribly impressed with the calendar visualization and interaction, but for messaging (which is the part I find most-compelling) it's flat-out awesome.Back in my Android days I had a rather kludgy version of this that sort-of worked.This is different -- Blend is awesome sauce and it's a unique feature.It's secure (it uses the internal tunneling that BlackBerry has in Link), it's reasonably quick, it works from and to pretty-much anywhere (on my laptop and desktop transparently, for example) and I don't have to pull the phone out of my pocket at my desk or pick it up; as long as the network can ""see"" it the functionality is there.Essentially, unless you need to charge the device (the charge status is visible in the lower right corner as well) provided you have a headset to take a call with you never need to take the phone out of your pocket, purse, briefcase or otherwise while at your desk for the common things you do with it while working.I like it -- a lot.Now onto Android compatibility, because I know a lot of people care about it.You have the Amazon app store that's preloaded if you wish to use it.I don't and haven't.I use SNAP so I have all my Android apps available.You choose. Those who argue that ""sideloading"" is difficult have rocks in their head; you simply plug in the USB cable once and drop the BAR file on the window.Done.It's that simple -- no ""development mode"" is required or anything else.I had to do it exactly once when I put SNAP on my Z10, and I had to do it once for the Passport.Whoopie.It's no harder than loading a program on a Windows computer or a Mac; if you can drag a file from one place to another you can do it.Once done you simply use the app like any other on the phone itself.Performance-wise Android apps run very well on the Passport.There have been some that were constrained -- severely so -- on the Z10.It's simply a matter of running the Android apps in a virtual machine and the constraints of doing so alongside the rest of QNX and the BlackBerry apps in a device with only so much RAM.This has gotten worse over the last year or so as app developers in the Android world started counting on devices having more and more memory native -- Fox News and MyFitnessPal are two that over the last six months have seen multiple updates that rendered them quite-severely constrained performance-wise on the Z10 -- while previous versions were great.The Passport's 3Gb of RAM eliminates this consideration entirely and the difference is a quantum level of improvement in the user experience.In short a large number of Android apps ran really well on the Z10.Nearly all of them, provided they don't need Google's Pay service (e.g. in-app billing) run really well on the Passport.How about the camera?It has 720p and 1080p video recording at both 30 and 60fps, the latter being ""slow motion"" of course when played at 30fps.The shooter itself has a 12Mbps sensor, a dedicated image processor and hybrid IS (both optical and digital); it works extremely well.It is capable of shooting in single-shot, burst mode (hold down the button and it rapid-fires frames) and of course video.Stills in 1x1 (square) format are 3120x3120 pixels; f/2 aperture.Your options for aspect ratio are 1x1, 4:3 and 16:9.I am getting clear pictures without flash at 1/5th of a second in dark locations such as my local neighborhood bar; the IS works amazingly well in low light.IMHO the JPEG algo is a bit too aggressive with sharpening but it's not awful by any means. In short while the camera will never be mistaken for a dSLR it produces very credible imagery -- even without flash in challenging lighting conditions.Battery life is as expected -- that is, excellent.I've spent the last couple of days intentionally not plugging the phone in at all and being that it's a new device and I'm playing around with it a lot I'm using it very heavily.I've yet to run out of power with a full day's heavy use spanning 18 hours, even when I include a half-hour or so of navigation.That's something you typically cannot do on any phone without plugging it in -- nav is pretty much the worst-case scenario as it heavily exercises the radio (if you're using maps over the cell link), GPS receiver, display (of course) and the CPU -- add it all up and you have a major power pig on your hands. Nonetheless, even with intentionally not plugging in while in the car I've yet to run out of power before retiring for the evening, although I have gotten into the single-digit percentage remaining range.Bravo.The 10.3.0 OS provided has the browser ""auto-font size"" problem that is in all of the previous versions of BB10 back to when manual font size selection disappeared (~10.1 if I recall correctly), and which I've reported on before. It's not particularly serious but is a bit annoying.This is fixed in 10.3.1 but there is currently no leak available nor any official update for the Passport -- and the Z10/Z-30/other device leaks that are available to date have no flash available in the browser at all which some people will find unacceptable.10.3.1 will come, and has other advantages -- but for right now it's definitely a bit of a bleeding edge in that in addition to flash being missing IKEv2 VPNs are broken.The latter is a serious problem for me as I really, really like the automatic connect-back to my VPN for any ""open"" WiFi network -- it secures such connections very effectively and completely but simply doesn't work right now on 10.3.1.On the other hand the profile customizations are awesome, so I'm very much looking forward to its availability for the Passport.Reading content (e.g. books, web pages, etc) on the screen is wildly satisfying -- dramatically better than any other ""pocketable"" device I've used.The Kindle app works fabulously and I strongly recommend using the ""Zoom Out"" mode with it, as it then goes into tablet configuration and is just a flat-out joy.Incidentally, if you select that mode for an Android app the mode is ""sticky"" on a per-app basis across invocations.In the end this is where the magic of the balance that BlackBerry put forward with the Passport design really shines -- they managed to get the utility of a tablet in your hands in terms of reading pleasure, whether your ""reading"" emails, books or viewing images and business data while not forcing you to try to stuff a 7"" tablet in your pants.While the device is only about 30% wider than my Z10 in point of fact, and about the same thickness, it is dramatically more-usable for content consumption and inspection.Some of this comes from the screen size, and the rest comes from the visual resolution and fidelity -- with 453ppi the screen surpasses what Apple calls ""retina"" (in fact it's best-in-class) and keeping with the Z10's design it's an IPS panel as well.It's a matter of balance and BlackBerry hit the ball out of the park in that regard.Any bigger would be too big; like Goldilocks' porridge the Passport is ""just right.""Oh, and it fits in my sporran -- yes, that's what you wear with a kilt.I have one (for hashing) and it can be used while running (it's sort of a ""front mount"" fanny pack.)I was concerned that I wouldn't have a running solution for music with the Passport but in fact I do.I've written much about BlackBerry's OS 10 in the past and how I consider it to be a revolutionary operating environment; the Hub standing alone is revolutionary compared against either Android or IOS.Another example is BlackBerry Travel -- it reads your email accounts and picks up anything travel related, automatically updating itineraries and similar.Make a hotel reservation and it will pick up the confirmation email back to you without your interaction; you can then point at the hotel in Travel and tell the phone to navigate there and it will do exactly what you'd expect -- open up the maps application and route you there.There's no keying in the address of the hotel necessary; it picks it up automatically.Another example of this integration: I had Travel alert me of a gate change while sitting in front of the gate at the airport in Dallas before the board in the airport updated!It's that good, that fast and if you travel at all for business or pleasure it's enough reason to use a BB10 device all on its own.None of the competitive offerings come close.Being able to run my own email, calendars and contact databases on my infrastructure without hassle (or having to load an external app) is extremely useful, as is the integration of all of this into the Hub.Android still doesn't handle this sort of thing properly; Android is great if your email, contacts and calendar are all Google based, but what if it's not -- or you don't want it to be?What if you have a half-dozen email accounts in different places and want all of them available on a seamless basis?K9Mail works well on Android in providing this functionality, for example, but it's an app and not integrated as a result.10.3 has extended the BB10 environment in many meaningful ways, including nice touches such as knowing when you pick up the phone from a flat surface (it wakes up) to the picture password option (incredibly secure yet very fast and easy to use), quick ""triage"" for your various accounts (allows filing and deleting with a single touch) and more.My complaints in terms of missing features are all of the OS variety -- there is still no S/MIME standalone support (for those not on BES) and there should be, and PGP would be nice.This is something that's quite-important and not just for encryption -- digital signatures provide evidence of lack of tampering, and are valuable standing alone. PGP is rumored to be coming, but there's been silence on S/MIME for non-BES users and IMHO that's idiotic. 10.3.1 has a decent set of contact-based overrides for profiles but I'd like content-sensitive capabilities (e.g. ""If a text message from Joe comes in AND contains the word URGENT, override the profile settings"") that are specific to each profile (e.g. the preceding is ONLY VALID in ""Bedside mode"".)The problem with the overrides is that if I have the phone set to silent I probably really mean it, while if it's in ""Bedside Mode"" I'd like certain things to override and ring through, but only certain things (and from certain people.)10.3.1's customizations get me halfway there; the other half would be fabulous. BlackBerry absolutely should allow modification of Android app permissions on an individual basis (yes, I know this can break an app but that's ok -- it should be my choice individually as it is for native apps) and there's nothing other than BlackBerry's decision in coding their Android VM keeping them from permitting it.Finally, BlackBerry needs to improve its IMAP integration; it is nearly perfect, but for one flaw -- ""delete"" means delete, unlike virtually every other implementation that lets you choose between that option and having the mail client move the message to an archive (or ""trash"") folder instead.I deal with this by having a ""mirrored"" email setup but fixing that problem would make for a true ""one mailbox, many clients"" implementation that works.None of this is Passport-specific and BlackBerry may (and should) address all of it.I have discovered one glitch specific to the Passport that annoyed me -- if you have ""instant previews"" turned on and get a message pop-up (e.g. a text message, etc) while using an Android app, and reply to it, the soft keyboard appears above the physical keyboard as expected (for numbers, symbols, etc.)It does not always disappear when you hit ""send"".That's a bug in that the soft line of keys will cover a piece of your app's screen and should disappear when you're done with the pop-up notification; closing and re-opening the app clears it.For a first-release software version, I'll note, one glitch that is mildly annoying is pretty darn good!What could BlackBerry do that would advance things even further?Improve Blend so that it can fully mirror the screen environment and port OpenOffice (or LibreOffice).If they then implemented my previous suggestion to use WiFi as a means to support an ""external"" screen (with effectively unlimited resolution) you now have a very effective desktop replacement for many applications and for those heavier users you have a seamless integration option too.The Passport has the processing and RAM capacity to support this, along with the connectivity required.So what's my verdict, in summary?BlackBerry's Passport brings to the forefront a device that is rationally-priced ($599 unlocked and no-contract at introduction; it will go $100 higher soon) while having top-of-class specifications, a fabulous screen that rivals tablet capability for reading books, working on spreadsheets or browsing images, the iconic BlackBerry keyboard in a new incantation that works exceptionally well, 32Gb of NVRAM (instead of the more-common 16Gb), 3Gb of system RAM (eliminating contention issues in my experience) and a SD slot that will accept up to a 128Gb card.Add to this incredible battery life, excellent performance, Blend for game-changing desktop integration and the total package winds up making time for you in your day instead of wasting time.The bottom line is that the Passport is a device that fundamentally fulfills the promise made years ago yet not delivered until now -- that is, to be smart.Such a device should learn from you, it should do things intuitively and it should make your life easier -- not because it enables you to do things if you go through some convoluted set of steps but because it does the logical thing for you and thus reduces the time you have to spend to get your work done.BlackBerry has a winner in the Passport.Simply put it's an actual, as opposed to promised but not delivered, smart phone.",2014年11月8日 在美国审核

Blackberry is back with a bang!,"This has be one of the candidates for the smartphone of 2014.I might be bias as Blackberry was my vert first smartphone ever.But I did switch to iPhone, Android and WIndow Phone for a few years.Last year, I came back to BB10.So I don't have issue with the leaning curve with this phone.By the way, the phone I am reviewing was purchased from shop blackberry.com.There are already many great reviews about this new Blackberry smartphone so I will keep mine short and simple.1. Battery life.I decided to jump ship during BBOS7 because of poor battery life.Of course at the other end, things didn't get much better with iOS, Android or Window phone.After a week using BB Passport, the battery life averages about 1 day and 8 hours on heavy usage and 2 full days on a single change on moderate usage (Updated 10/22/14).Pretty good and I feel just like the old day of BBOS6 battery life (Bold 9700 or Bold 9780)2. Screen.Wide format allows me to be more productive with documents viewing and editing.Web browser looks a lot closer to desktop computer.Screen is crisp (high dpi) and vibrant in color.Photo and video look awesome.My wife envy me every time I look at FB photos.They look a lot better than her iPhone 5S.Of course the drawback on video or some photos would be the size in widescreen format.It is about the size of iPhone 4S perhaps just a tad bigger.3. Keyboard. This can vary from person to person.I like BBPP innovative touch sensitive keyboard.It is implemented relatively well.Not perfect, but I can see improvement over time via software update.Typing can be a challenge at first whether you come from virtual keyboard or physical keyboard phone.I personally found the transition to be in no time.Within a few days, it has become a second nature for me typing and flicking words for long messages at ease.Typing feeling however is not as good as Bold 9900 keyboard but at least it is as good as the old Bold 9700 keyboard.Update 10/22/14, please note that most will have issue with the space bar.I did.I is relative small in size and you need to hit pretty close to the center of the button, which can be challenging at first.4. Speaker.Most of BB10 devices excluding Z30 have below average speaker.BBPP sparker is not only loud enough for me to make a phone call outdoor on speaker phone, but the sound quality is also superb. Excellent depth in both treble and bass considering it is just small speaker phone.5. Others.This phone flies at doing things with ease.First of all, I don't side load Android apps or play games.The response and feeling overall are way faster and better than my old Z10.Camera works ok.The focus is too slow, but hope that the new OS update will fix it.The nano SIM and micro SD card cover is very difficult to open particularly for the very first time trying.Later it is not as difficult, but I feel like it may break if it isn't opened correctly or pulled too hard.At this price point, Blackberry should have done a better job with this.In the end, I am very happy with my purchase.The phone is SIM free and can be used with any GSM carrier in the US or around the world.I am using it on T-Mobile and it picks up 4GLTE with blazing fast internet speed.If you was once Blackberry phone user, give this a try.On the other hand, if you depend heavily on apps or love to watch movie and play game. this is not your phone.Edited: Black Friday deal is too good to pass up so I bought another one as a gift for someone.",2014年10月17日 在美国审核

"it is a nice phone, better than it shows on the pictures","Blackberry may isolate you from social networks, which means high productive work days.The communication BB really focus on is person to person, through email, chat on FB or LinkedIn. It has enough apps for me to read news. I do miss Starbucks App that I can scan and pay for the coffee.Overall, it is a nice phone, better than it shows on the pictures. However, it does not have the beauty of Apple products, or nothing in the market has. However, I really enjoy the high quality of the voice as phone calls are major part of my work. Plus a strong email system. What can I ask for?Blackberry is like a cubicle that force you to concentrate on the work at hand and the persons really show up in your life.",2015年6月11日 在美国审核

The functionality and speed are top notch and the best available for messaging, email, telephone calls, calendar and browsing.

What a phone!!!,"What a phone!! I use this phone for both work and play. The fluidity and depth of new OS has surpassed any of its competitors. I can say that after coming from an iOS and Android background. I was always intrigued by this device since blackberry announced it but hesitated to buy it initially when all those ""The Verge"", ""Wall Street Journal"", etc. reviews started coming in and trashed this lovely piece of technology. Now, i doubt the professionalism of those websites as I see them heavily influenced. Anyways, this device is perfect for handling emails, working on documents on the go, browsing and music. Actually that's what I use it for on a normal day. The call, voice and speaker clarity is amazing!! The implementation of touch enabled keypad is awesome and improves the navigation and typing considerably. The keyboard took me 1 week to get used to. Not to forget, the battery is more than enough for 2 days after heavy data usage. I don't play games on it, so can't comment on it, but other than that, i truly believe it's the best device in the market right now!! I get amazing reactions from people in subway, office and friends. I hope BlackBerry would step-up the marketing game so that more people know about this product. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a work cum personal entertainment phone.",2014年12月19日 在美国审核

I am giving this Passport a 5 star rating because it is a great phone and built to last.

Work Horse. It's fun too.,"I have been using this phone for 3 months. It's more like a mini-laptop for me for the functionality, but without the bulk. I'll describe how I use it in different aspects of my day. People have stopped me at the coffee shop, the mall, the bar in the airport asking me about it. I tell them to get one, I love it. Unless watching wide aspect video ratios is a big use case - then get a regular smartphone.Work:The company where I work integrated its servers with my access, so I can access SharePoint sites, download documents, etc. My iPhone and Android colleagues are jealous as they can't get the same access and need their laptops. Since my work has a BES server, I just needed to enter a password for my email / calendar (Outlook), and another for my company's WiFi. Occasionally have had connectivity issues, so I just turn off the wifi and use the cell phone connection. Issue is probably on the wifi networks side as we have black holes in some rooms using laptops (lots and lots of electronics probably causing interference), but LTE is fine. Other phone users don't complain, but they're usually just IM'ing/texting while I'm trying to get to our databases.Browser works great, not like old BlackBerries. Fast. The email / messaging hub is really pretty good. It took me about 6 weeks to really get it, but it's a really simple concept that works well, and removed the stress from keeping up with my inbox clean. It's actually changed my behavior. I have around 7 or 8 different email addresses (4 heavily used) for different functions in my life. The hub gives the unread status really easily for each, and also LinkedIn, BBM, Twitter and WhatsApp (and probably Facebook, but I don't use that). I don't do Instagram, but there might be an app hole there. At home, it makes it easy to ignore workwhen I want, or ignore the account I use for retail where I dump the marketing messages from Banana Republic, Home Depot, etc. Also I file every work email into almost a hundred different folders (structured - I have folders in folders). I can get into my whole work Outlook archive without any issues, and without needing to sync the folder locally to my phone though I also have that option. Outlook integration was awesome. No issues with calendars, and I use calendars from 2 different accounts. I'm typing this on a laptop, but have typed 2 page emails on this thing. I use both hands and hook my right pinky under the bottom near the space bar for balance. I find I'm using the ""flip the word up on the screen"" feature more and more - easily beating anyone trying to type on a different phone. Also using the scroll pad feature much more in the last 4 weeks (the keyboard also acts like a mouse pad, and you can scroll around web pages, or use it to precision move the cursor by just sweeping your finger across it)The display is great. Better DPI that an iPhone6 and it shows. It's rugged. iPhone users almost crapped when I have dropped it, but no issues. I have left it in my back pocket driving home from work with no issue. Without a case, it easily fits in my breast shirt pocket. Tight with a case. Might be a little too big for a smaller person's pants pocket, but no issues for me. I can get away with jeans, and fits in mine easily with a case (PdAir flip up). I use the case because it has kept the feature where you can set the phone to lock whenever you put it in a case. And saves the screen my keys in my pocket. BlackBerries usually go into sleep mode when it senses a magnet hidden in a case. 3rd party case makers also put small magnets in to keep the feature. Much better than a timeout for battery life.I work in the tech industry, and deal with hardware. Camera is great for that, and I use it to document hardware configurations, but also have been using it as a magnifying glass. Take a picture and zoom in. I think it's a 13MP. Very very good for detail of circuit boards, etc.The battery is amazing. I never worry about charge. Ever. Easily lasts a full day for me without even trying, even when I'm playing MP3s for 10 hours on headphones during product bringup.There's the ""BlackBerry"" Balance feature which is fairly invisible to me. It's like having 2 phones. With one swipe and a tap you can switch from Personal Mode (where all your apps are installed, etc.) to Work mode, and same to get back. I don't think our administrator has fully locked it down as I can still access my work email while in Personal, but to download from SharePoint I need to switch over. It's kind of like having 2 phones in one. When in work mode, I can't save to the SD card. Lots of space internally though. I think 32G, and I still have 17G free. There's also a little nuance where you can be in Personal mode, and unlock Work mode but stay in Personal. So you get your work emails while playing Angry Birds (yes I can install Angry Birds and almost any Android app). However, you can just press the little unlock icon to lock down work and it just tells you how many work emails you have (and that you can't read until you unlock with a password). If that is unlocked, with access to work mode, all pictures get saved in the ""work"" area, not the ""personal"" area. I've set personal photos and videos to be saved on the SD card. All photos while ""work"" is unlocked get saved to internal memory, and CANNOT be sent from a personal email address. I'm sure that's admin controlled, but shows how it like having a work phone and a personal phone in the same hardware, but with a virtual fence between them.Screen is good for reading documents. Excellent actually. The aspect ratio works. I have brought up Excel sheets with charts to check it out in the lab and zoomed around them. I can read schematics (detailed pdf drawings) in a pinch, but not the best. I don't like using my laptop either, since I really prefer a &gt;= 30 inch monitor. So until they make a foldable screen or a projector feature.... Screen shape for reading does work well.Shape of phone is unusual. I have to admit, it can be a bit big for me and I'm a big guy. Maybe if they made it just 1 row of keys narrow.What I would change:-Slightly adjust the size smaller, but not too small. I don't like my wife's Bold 9900 anymore after using this. Just one row of keys narrower.-Add a auto brightness feature. I might try to write an app for that. Haven't seen one yet. No time so I'll gladly pay a couple of bucks. If it's bright out, automatically brighten the screen. If it's dark, you can drop the brightness.-The spreadsheet program no longer has an insert row or column. Really? What gives. Needs to be fixed badly.-Biggest one, and should be fixed in software: It has a feature to change the meaning of the keys to be a number pad. For example, if you're in excel or writing an email, just swipe down on the keyboard/track pad. The bottom of the screen then displays number keys, but these are also mapped to the keyboard so pressing Q gives a 0, W gives a 1, ... M gives a $ etc. If you hold down the virtual shift key you can Num Lock it to enter 12345 as WERSD from the hard keyboard (and not have to use the touch screen). But they did NOT put a decimal here! I need to touch the touch screen, and then use the lock. So I want to enter a pile of numbers with decimals, I need the touch screen. The keyboard would be faster. Also, if you do that (Blackberry, I'm talking to you), give us the option to also include an E on the num lock screen along with the decimal so we can do scientific notation.-Calculator is pretty poor. Just a regular one. I downloaded a free one called ARITY. Can do trig, scientific, etc. and will turn into a graphing calculator if you enter functions like sin(x)/x. So I'm happy now.-I kind of miss the menu/blackberry button on the older models. And the U-turn / back key also in the ribbon. This phone is built on swipe gestures. Took me a couple of days to get the hang of it, but now it's second nature. Much better than the paradigm change from Windows 8 that I still hate.-If you double tap the touchpad/keyboard, a precision cursor comes up and you can scroll around to where you need to go. For example if I want to insert a work in the middle of a sentence I already typed, just double tap, a cursor comes up, and you mouse over to where you want to type. Hope that makes sense. Would be nicer if you (BlackBerry - talking to you), made the precision cursor circle a big magnifying glass like Docs2Go used to (in 2009). iPhones do it naturally but that's because you are moving your finger on top of the words you are trying to see. By the way, a guy with the iPhone 6+ was watching me do it, and was pretty intrigued by the scrolling touch pad / keyboard gizmo feature.I've written too much already, so I'll just scramble through the ""home"" portionHome:-Battery life simply awesome. Main reason for purpose, and now I don't also need a Kindle / tablet.-Yahoo email accounts seem to be a bit slow on syncing, so sometimes just manually refresh from the email menu. BTW, BlackBerry service was AMAZING for my wife. They worked with her for several hours when her personal Yahoo! account was not refreshing on her Bold 9900. I could not believe the level of service. They eventually got it fixed, and took them over a day. Using a BB and Yahoo on the same weekend, I had no problems. So was not a system wide issue. But the attention and time they gave. Wow.netflix-Has a USB2 micro port. Data transfers are slow since not USB3, but I never use a cable unless charging. Comes with a fast charger - 1300mA. I'm guessing charges in an hour or less. I still use a regular amperage BB usb2 charger from 6 years ago (700mA) as I really don't need it charged in just an hour or 2. From 50% to 100% takes about 1 hour 20 minutes. The fast 1300mA charger that was included with the phone is crazy fast.-I have streamed video, but the square screen is honestly not the best to view a 16:9 world. I don't watch many, so no big deal. Can't comment on Netflix. Youtube is just fine.-I had trouble playing a flash video (downloaded my golf instruction). Since it comes with the Amazon App World I just installed VidOn.me (Android App) and no problems.-I have the Kindle App from Amazon Android store. No problems. Also like FBReader.-You can load almost any Android app. If you can't find it in the Amazon App Store, install SNAP. SNAP gives you all the apps in the Google Play store. To install snap, just search on the CrackBerry.com website. I have Google Maps, Yelp, Flixster etc etc. from there. Only app not working is Redfin.-It's got games. I don't play many. BrickBreaker is pretty bad on it, but you can pull in whatever you want from the Android side. The tilt and accelerometr are tied in so you can play Android racing games, etc.-Camera is amazing outside in bright sunlight. Face detection works well. Will do time shift to avoid closed eyes. Also does panorama after the iPhone standardized that feature a few years ago.-Focus can be slow. Should be fixable in software. Same with HDR.-The flash is too cold (white or green color). If they warmed it up a bit, people would look better / more normal.-The camera has a bunch filters I have played with. Also decent photo editing. If you want more, there are free and paid apps that work well (Photo Studio)-The iPhone and Android guys at work loved this, though they can probably get the same. I'm writing Python code and running in a BlackBerry native app. Cool.-Runs Yahtse to control my xbmc home theater. No issues.-Takes any music file. I encoded all my CDs into FLAC. This plays them with no issue. I didn't downconvert to mp3 since it was easier for me to through a pile of music on the SD card.-Banking software - no issues so far.-It's got an FM radio that I don't use but tested.-Wish it had an IR (infra-red) to control my HTPC.-BlackBerry Maps - not good for walking or Manhattan subways. So use google maps. BB Maps works well for Califronia freeways. Would like the traffic colored lines to be thicker. Sometimes the traffic highlight get hidden in the street for my eyes, but maybe I'm used to the bright green google maps on my old phone. I guess that's rare on California freeways anyway :)I imagine that's enough details. If you want a phone to kill emails, work, reading documentation, but will still play games and other stupid apps... GET IT. But I understand if you're tied to the BlackBerry ribbon - so maybe check out the Classic.",2015年2月14日 在美国审核

Very nice phone!,"I purchased the blackberry passport two weeks ago from amazon. I'm not a high power user, nor use this phone for business purposes. I was looking for a new phone to replace my nexus 4, and after reading many good reviews from people who actually purchased the passport, I decided to give it a try. I absolutely love using this phone. This is my first blackberry phone so I still getting used to OS. The passport is just a wonderful made device. It feels very sturdy and the rubber type material on back of the phone feels very nice. This is my first qwerty device with a touch sensitive keyboard, and even with the learning curve this keyboard is a joy to use. Although the passport is uniquely wide, I had no problems fitting it in my back jeans pockets. I wear a 29 in the waist, so I'm not a very big person at all. If you are on the fence about buying this phone, I would recommend giving it a try.",2014年11月20日 在美国审核
Made for everyone!,"Keyboard LOOKS simple, but it has more functionality and versatility than any keyboard I have used on a phone.I am a software developer/power user, and I can almost code comfortably with this keyboard it is so easy to use and the gestures are far more intuitive than I ever expected.It is also so nice to have a phone that actually multitasks and doesn't reload web pages when I navigate back to the browser. BB Browser is possibly better than Chrome for Android too - I almost always leave it in desktop mode as it handles HTML5 pretty flawlessly.It is also nice that I DO NOT want to constantly take a sledgehammer and smash my phone like my previous Galaxy S and HTC One's because they couldn't handle all the crap I wanted to do with my phone.This phone puts user input as first priority and never misses a keystroke!A little wide and heavy, but definitely worth it!

BEST PHONE ON THE MARKET (REAL QWERTY),"Great phone, the size is great for read emails, read news and anything else, apps are super good you can download the Blackberry app, the Amazon app, and Google app (1mobilemarket). battery is amazing double of any phone on the market, people ask me all the time about the phone, the qwerty (realqwerty) is a most for me, camera is good 13 MP, and the price in Amazon $599 compare with Samsung and iPhone is not expensive. speakers are super loud and stereo, Love the phone",2014年12月2日 在美国审核
Much better than I expected!,"I wasn't quite sure how I would take to the form factor, but after a couple weeks, I'm sold! It's a unique and powerful device, and once you ""unlearn"" your previous keyboarding techniques and adapt to the Passport's one-of-a-kind capacitive keyboard, you'll be typing like a pro. The shortcuts and intuitive gestures allow you make short work of any typing task once you are familiar with them. And the screen...it's w-i-d-e, but in a good way. You can see content in the way it was meant to be viewed on a computer screen, with a lot less scrolling. I look at the screen of my Z10 now and know I can never go back. And if you are a heavy user, you will be happy to know that the battery life on this phone is second to none. I regularly have 60% or more remaining on the phone when I put it back on the charger at bedtime.All in all, it's a device that works for my needs in a smartphone, better than I expected...and it's not just another ""me too"" phone, it's a head turner. Be different...get one!",2014年11月4日 在美国审核
Apps make it stand apart!,"It's early, but so far it is the best phone I've ever had.I love the wide screen, touch keyboard and battery life.And that would be enough, but what really sets it apart are the apps.Your first choice for apps should be Blackberry World, and since it is a Blackberry its productivity apps (e.g. e-mail, contacts, calendar) are far beyond Android and iPhone apps.They are integrated and work together.For example, one feature that Outlook used to have but has been missing for years is the ability to import an e-mail into your calendar as a calendar invite, including all addressees as invitees and including the body of the e-mail in the calendar invite.I loved it!Then Outlook mysteriously dropped it.Now I have it back with my Blackberry apps.The second choice should be the Amazon Android apps store - as they are all certified for use with the Passport.My experiences here have been very good and it was very easy since I'm also an Amazon customer.But what really put it over the top was SNAP.An app that front ends the Google store.I came from a Galaxy S5 (which I also loved) and could not find some of my banking and other productivity apps on Amazon.But I downloaded them from Google with SNAP and they run great on the Passport.",2014年10月24日 在美国审核
Very Pleased,"Interesting phone. If you want something that looks different works different and handles your work load like no other phone this is the one for you. It's been two weeks and I love this phone I wishe it had a more streamlined shape but other than that it is great. The screen is very vivid and extremely sharp and I love the IOS that blackberry has came up with, the keyboard is my first love of course and I love it's width and feel, being able to use android and amazon appstore is great. As I use this phone more I will update you more. Also this review is being typed on the BlackBerry Passport.",2015年3月31日 在美国审核
Excuse me while I take my foot out of my mouth!,"Coming from Apple devices and Android, I have to say this phone is pretty darn awesome! I was BIG into Android....I even converted Crapple owners after I was fed up with Apples downfalls:-) I still love Android don't get me wrong, but the Passport is amazing. A beautiful and high end looking device that's snappy and has lots of neat features! Took a short time to get used to the square size, but now I quite enjoy it! Screen is crisp and clear, the speakers are loud and sound fantastic! I don't play many games, so I can't comment on that but for productivity, it's perfect! I have many Google Apps on it, I even have Google Service apps running....just look it up and you'll find the answers you need to get that going. The battery life is absolutely insane. I'm one of those who always forgets to charge their phone....this beast lasts forever and charges quickly! Never thought I'd ever own a Blackberry, after making fun of the company and the people who used them for many years. Guess I'll take my foot out of my mouth now! :-)",2016年2月27日 在美国审核
Love the big screen,I wanted something different.I definitely got it.Love the big screen.I have to say that the keyboard is what I like the most.Love the Hub.It just works for me.Makes it more fluid when keeping in contact with family.Not a big app person so lack of Candy Crush and Angry Birds is just fine with me.Has all the apps I use in the amazon app store.I like having a phone that is so much different.Battery lasts a very long time which is nice also.,2015年9月28日 在美国审核

Best smartphone ever built,"I used IPhone 6 plus for two weeks and gave it to my wife. I just can't stand the poor battery life and no major new features for the past 4 years. I switched to Blackberry Passport and felt it was worth every penny. First, I no longer worry about charging my phone in office. For modest usage, Passport can last two days. For heavy usage, I can still count the phone to last when I get back home. Secondly, the typing is feeling way better by using physical keys and swiping on the screen instead of just on the screen. Internet browser has desktop version which my previous IPhone 6 plus lacked; File manager helps me organize my files like using my computer. In my wife's word, Passport is like a mini computer. If you like productivity and easy to use, choose Passport. If you go for games and time-wasting apps, choose IPhone 6 plus.",2015年4月16日 在美国审核
"Great phone, great OS","Great phone, great OS, perfect size; If you communicate by using email text and so on this is the phone for you. but there is no support for the OS anymore. barely any updates. There's issues I run into that aren't fixed. Im not holding my breath I just live with these flaws since I love the phone so much. I've loved black berry since my original curve. but honeslty I won't buy another since they are putttinga lltheirmoney an effort into their android based phones. it's a shame. But I guess they have to do whatever it takes to stay afloat.",2016年8月24日 在美国审核
A Productivity Beast In Your Hands!,"I bought the BlackBerry Passport about a month and a half ago, and I'm just in love with this phone! To be honest, I don't feel the need to use my laptop as often since a lot of the work that can be done is done on this Passport. My favorite thing so far is the video playback, which has improved from the Z10. The apps are better since I use both apk files (side loading, of course) and purchases from BlackBerry World and Amazon Apps. The screen size is wonderful because most things are expanded to fit the display. Using the keyboard, I have to use two hands which is fine. I'm able to type a lot faster than a virtual keyboard. I've already typed out articles on my Word doc and has made working while traveling much easier. Anyway, I just can't leave this phone alone. My Z10 just looks a lot smaller and odd to me now since owning the Passport!",2015年1月17日 在美国审核
Beauty is more than skin deep with this great phone!,"I totally ADORE this phone!! This is my very favorite BlackBerry yet. I love it so much I ended up getting Cricket service since Sprint is choosing not to support BlackBerry and I really wanted to use this phone. Calls are great on it, texting and BlackBerry messenger all work fabulous. Reading a book on this phone is a JOY! I have a few excel files and word documents on it, all very easy to read. Pinch and zoom is great. My music sounds fabulous on it, and I have a few videos on it, watching them is wonderful. When I first got it the ringtones were WAY too short. If you had on a heavy coat you might not hear them at all they quit so soon. Also the keyboard didn't used to light up which made using it in the dark awful. BUT updates have taken care of both of those problems. Ringtones are fine and keys light up. It took a bit to get used to no numbers on the keyboard but not that long. Super easy to switch languages too. The camera on this thing is FANTASTIC. It is better than my real camera. I took my best vacation photos with this phone! The battery is a beast! It really lasts me all day and thats with a lot of music listening, checking the web although I do not do social media with my phone. OS 10 on it is wonderful. I really think the best BB yet and I plan to use it for a long time. Oh, and the beautiful red? Rockin' awesome! LOVE it!",2015年8月4日 在美国审核

The square screen makes internet and email more enjoyable than a rectangle shaped one. The physical key board doubles as a mouse. The interface is easy to use and has all the aps i could ever use. If your a business person this is the phone to end all phones. When you walk into your cell provider they will eat their words when they see this phone. Blackberry is a real smart phone. If you want a phone for movies and games this isnt for you, but if your an adult and want a sectretary this is for you.",2015年2月28日 在美国审核

Its NOT too BIG!,"This phone works awesome! 10 times better than a Z10 or Classic. Don't think its too big, this fits well in slim fit dress pants as well as work jeans! I think it fits better than a Z10 and the way the power button is positioned it doesn't always restart like my Z10 did.The swipe on the keypad is great and camera quality is spectacular. crystal clear pictures a nice change from a Z10 and the Bold. I had some pics from a BB Bold and they where really fuzzy at first especially for bbm profile pics they are not clear. Only downside is the feeds pictures on bbm are too big so you have to scroll sometimes to see the whole picture.The battery lasts two days and being a manager and always using the phone is huge. One case at 1:30pm my battery was at 15%. BY 7:30 battery was finally blinking red! Honestly the battery was red and flashing for an hour! I told my contacts at 1:00pm I wouldn't be able to contact them but regardless I made countless calls, texts, and emails and with out a charger this saved my evening.Only design flaw I find is the camera sticks out a little so without a case the camera lens can get scratched. Don't text and drive but when you try to text with one hand its almost impossible and I have big hands! Highly recommend this product! you won't be disappointed.",2015年11月10日 在美国审核
