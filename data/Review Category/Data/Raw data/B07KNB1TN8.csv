A lengthy review of a refurbished galaxy note 9,"I did a lot of research before buying a phone, and was quite worried that I would get ripped off from purchasing one online. Additionally, I've had poor luck with several of Amazon's third party retailers. With this in mind, I was very skeptical about potential false reviews, false advertising, or a damaged product. However, for the price it was the best deal I could find on a galaxy note 9 outside of a carrier plan. So, after seeing that the item was returnable I gave it a shot. Luckily, it worked. I recieved a fully unlocked note 9 with a charger and instructions on how to activate it.I will say that many of the reviews I read prior to buying insisted otherwise, and they were likely correct. If you're purchasing from Amazon, you'll probably see several similar looking deals with identical display pictures (which isn't a good sign in my book). Even if it is a prime eligible deal be careful and read through the descriptions. Look at the seller information and read the return policies on refurbished phones. It should list something about being returned within 2 weeks of the original purchase. If it does not be skeptical. Also, It should be noted that anyone can make up a business name and description on amazon, then sell used items out of their basement if they wanted, so look carefully through the seller's ""company"" reviews.Furthermore, the charger that came with my purchase was not an original Samsung charger. It was a cheaper off brand model that charged slower by comparison. The phone itself had little to no scratches. These micro scratches are small and only visible after a very close inspection on my part. The battery life on my phone has been excellent! This came as quite a nice surprise. I've used it for several months now and it keeps a charge like new. I can go two full days with mild/moderate use off one charge. ( Mild/moderate meaning not using my phone constantly throughout the day to watch movies, play games, or scroll through social media posts. I may have watched short videos for class, read emails, texts, short calls, etc.)Overall, the phone has worked quite well and continues to do so. Last thing I'll say is I highly reccomend the galaxy note 9 for the specs to cost ratio (as of 2019). Its a good phone for the value, even though phones in general are expensive. Any additional information on the phone specs and relative market comparisons would require another lengthy review, so I won't drag this on any further lol.Hopefully this helped someone and thanks for reading!",2019年7月19日 在美国审核

Second Time's A Charm!,"Someone wrote that when we reviewed it would be helpful to write who we purchased our phone from so other potential buyers know who to buy from and who to avoid, so I will share my experience with trying to buy a secondhand note 9.<br>I had originally purchased a note 9 from WIRELESS WAREHOUSE. The phone was ""Amazon Renewed"" so I figured it would be in better shape, but it wasn't the quality that I was expecting, especially with the amount of scratches on the screen and the worn-out S-pen.Also, although the phone was supposed to be factory unlocked, the phone was locked to Sprint so it wouldn't work correctly with my Tracfone sim. For this reason, I ended up having to send back the phone.Afterwards, I bought a 2nd note 9, this time from EDGE CELLULAR and it came in near perfect condition with the exception of two little nicks on two of the corners but other than that, the phone was flawless [although, I did pay about $50 more for this one (total $440) than the original one I bought]. One thing different about this purchase was that it came in a Samsung box with all the original accessories including some headphones.Also, the 2nd phone was truly factory unlocked, so when I put in my Tracfone sim, it worked automatically. I'm much happier with the 2nd purchase and I think I will be keeping this one as long as it remains working well. I'll give an update in about a month or so to be sure.Hope this helps y'all.UPDATE: though it's been longer than a month, I just thought I'd mention that the phone is still great even in 2020. I absolutely love this Note 9 and am glad I made the purchase. Everything still works great!</br>",2019年11月19日 在美国审核
Great phone,"Opted for a note 9 instead of the upcoming 10 due to budget restraints and it is by far an excellent choice. I really didn't need all the bells ND whistles of the 10.This one works excellently. It came in a white box with charger, cable, Sim tray pin. I took out my Sim and SD card from my note 8, popped them in, turned on Samsung Switch on both ND let it rip. Done in less than an hour, every single app, contact, song, password, account, keyboard, done! Calls are much clearer, louder.This was a renewed phone and it is flawless out of the box.

No WiFi calling on this model,"Love the Galaxy Note 9 but I had to return this phone because it does not have WiFi calling. It was compatible with Verizon like it advertised but apparently the model N960u1 is not compatible with WiFi calling. It was suggested that the model N960u would be compatible with WiFi calling but since I can't check it before I buy it, I won't be buying factory unlocked again. I checked the phone at the Verizon store and it does have WiFi calling and is model N960u, so maybe it is just a model problem instead of an unlocked problem. However, it was indicated by the technicians that flash firmware would have to be downloaded on unlocked phones.",2018年12月10日 在美国审核

Just like new,"I know Amazon does not say which seller you bought from, so I'll say I bought my renewed Galaxy Note 9 from Re-Cell and I 1000% recommend to buy from them! I was very hesitant to buy a renewed phone, especially from Amazon where it's such a mixed bag. I'm glad to say I'm pleasantly surprised! I couldn't even tell the phone was ever used except for the fact that it was turned on in the box when I first opened it. The box itself was honestly impressive, it looked exactly like the galaxy note 9 box but with the seller's logo instead of Samsung's. I should also mention that it is listed as a Verizon unlocked phone, but came unlocked for all carriers!In terms of the phone, there were no scratches, dents or anything of the like. Everything is fully functional. The S-pen is the original Samsung one. No problems with call quality, wifi connectivity, etc. The charger isn't the original, but again looks like a replica of the original. I had a bit of an issue with getting the charger to fast charge the phone, every few minutes the screen would light up as it would stop and then start charging again. However, I have a few other fast charging adapters and cables, so this wasn't a big deal. The seller even included headphones! Nothing amazing, but enough to go above and beyond the Amazon listing.Again, I bought this phone from Re-Cell and can't verify the condition of the device you would get from another seller. But with the money back guarantee, I would recommend buying this phone and returning it if the condition is bad. You really can't beat the price.",2020年1月16日 在美国审核

Nice phone only a few minor problems,"**UPDATE 3-16-2020**Phone recently updated to Android 10 and it has gone south. I can charge the battery to 100% and go to bed, when I wake up 8 hours later the battery will be drained 25% or more. I found that if I leave wifi OFF it will only drain 5% overnight. So for some reason wifi now causes the battery life to shorten considerably.With only a 90 day warranty on the ""renewed"" phones, I am out of luck for repair 10 months after purchasing the phone.**ORIGINAL 4 STAR REVIEW** I bought a ""Renewed"" phone from Seller CellGuru. It arrived before the date originally quoted on the order. All i got was a phone and a charger. The battery was at 18% upon arrival so I plugged it into the included charger and went out for the night. When I returned more than 5 hours later, the battery was at 24% so I was shocked. I messaged Amazon and after a little troubleshooting, it appears the charger is defective. They gave me a credit to buy a new charger on Amazon and all is good.The screen does have VERY minor scratches which are visible only at certain angles in sunlight, so it's not 100% renewed.I had to take the phone to Verizon to get a new sim card because I was upgrading from a Note 4 with a much larger sim card. They gave me a new sim card in minutes, plugged it in for me and it was good to go! The guy at Verizon told me they can also give me insurance on the phone but I passed.The only thing that scared me was before I got the sim card, I used the phone on wi-fi to transfer all of my apps and such over. I opened Google chrome and it went directly to a Sprint home page. So, after seeing that I was afraid it was going to be locked to Sprint but it wasn't. It must have been a Sprint phone before being unlocked.The only reason I took off a star was because of the little scratches on the screen and the shoddy charger.I will update my review if things turn south with the phone in my 90 warranty period.If you found this review helpful, please click the button below.

"Charging port doesn't insert phone, not original type c charger, phone turns off at 14%","The phone wasn't in it's original box ""Samsung"", the charger wasn't the original one, it didn't come with the plastic new phones come to be protected from scratches, and the phone was also power on. The area you insert to charge the phone is a little off, in the sense of that the type C cable would not stay inside to charge the phone. You have to insert it very hard and even with that, the phone notifies me that it's not properly charging. I shouldn't have to insert the cable that roughly because no Samsung ever required that. The phone takes forever to charge, I put my phone to charge 12am it's 5:55am on a dec 6, 2019 and it has charged to 84%. The phone is nice and easy to maneuver but it has a flaw in the charging port area. The battery is also flaky because the phone turns off at 14%. This has been a huge disappointment and expensive mistake. I am returning the device.New update: I reached out to the third party selling this item for a refund. They never responded so I had to contact amazon and file a report with them. Amazon try reaching out to them and the third party didn’t comply.

Note 9 honest review,"I generally don't add reviews on products, but the reviews of others helped me make this purchase so I am paying it forward. First, I highly recommend you check the seller before buying and making sure they have a high rate of positive reviews and low rate/if any negative reviews. Also make sure they adhere to Amazons return policy, I saw a seller or two with additional hoops they add on top of the return policy, and I wasn't trying to bother with that noise. I purchased my Note 9 from CR Daily Deals. So far about 2 weeks after purchasing I am pretty satisfied with the phone. I previously had a Samsung Note 5 and the upgrade to the Note 9 was pretty nice. The biggest change between them being the battery life, the Note 9 lasts me from 6:30am to about 10pm and is about 50% battery life, its really nice not being tethered to a wall every few hours. I received only the Phone itself and a generic charger block and wire. No stylus nibs or extractor, biggest pain is no SIM card key, which also happens to be where the SD card is located. Thankfully 128gb is plenty for me for the foreseeable future of my use on this phone. Very easily got the phone activated on Verizon with a 5 minute store trip, and then using the Smart Switch app was able to move over literally everything from previous phone. At this point, putting both phones next to each other, you would only be able to notice a difference in the phone itself otherwise all my apps, photos, folders, etc. are exactly where they were on my previous phone. So far, no complaints on how the phone works (aside from small things I need to get used to), and no issues with the performance of the phone. The phone did also have a screen protector already installed on it, however it was almost 100% from previous owner not the seller and it does not cover the curvature of the screen. Literally just this morning I noticed there is a slight chipping to the edge of the protector, I highly recommend getting a protector that actually covers the entirety of the screen, that is my next purchase.<br>Overall, if you are somewhat hesitant to make the purchase, I will let you know so was I. Thankfully it ended up being a great purchase and I would recommend the seller CR Daily Deals or GoOverstock.com from the sellers I have seen. You are also covered by a solid return policy, but here's to hoping that will be unnecessary. Good luck out there!</br>",2019年8月27日 在美国审核

Great phone but you may need to buy a couple,"**Update**<br>The phone would not not connect to Sprint 4G. Samsung acknowledged that there is a software problem due to the merger of Sprint and Tmobile and they are not compatible with Sprint at the moment. Had to file an A-to-Z claim with O'Crack because they never refunded me after returning the phone.I ended up buying a few of these phones and returning the one I didn't want. The first one I received from Digital Age USA and had a screen protector on it, and a small gash. It was obviously a pre-owned phone that they were trying to pawn off as a reconditioned phone. If you receive a phone with a screen protector remove it immediately and check the screen, most of the time they are trying to hide screen burn or scratches. The second phone I received was from O'Crack and was like night and day, it was like a brand new phone. I am so glad I purchased the second one because I was starting to think that that was the quality of phones from this listing. The return went seamlessly and I was refunded my money within about a week. The phone itself is amazing, I've used the phone all day and still cannot drain the battery completely.

I admit I was a bit hesitant - I do not regret this purchase.,"I will admit I was a little hesitant on picking up a ""Renewed"" phone, I wasn't sure what to expect. I purchased the Midnight Black Note 9 from DNCL-TECHZONE, INC and so far I could not be more happy.<br>The phone came secured in an unmarked white box inside the Amazon package with a charger brick and a cable, I already knew this from the description and previous comments/reviews so this was not a surprise, I have headphones and other chargers so this was not a factor.My first impression out of the box - cosmeticallythe phone is absolutely flawless, no scratches anywhere, screen is perfectly fine. It even had what appeared as a form fitting protective plastic film along the top protecting the SIM card tray and the bottom where the speaker, charging port and S-Pen is located. The phone booted up fast, it guided me through the setup just like a brand new phone. Since the battery was down to 18% I charged it, again no issues at all. Full charge to 100% took about 2 hours, 20 minutes, (I'll probably pick up a fast charger at a later date.)Now coming from iPhone/ iOS the Android system is completely new to me and a slight learning curve, but a fun one. It did need a software update, it looks like the update from Aug. 2019 that adds Night photo mode, new user interface, other new features to the Android system. The update installed without any problems. Opening multiple apps, working with split screen, playing with the S-Pen, the phone is super fast, no apps - or phone crashed.I was working initially via WiFi with downloading apps, connecting email accounts, etc. A slight concern that I had was - would my Verizon SIM card on my iPhone work on the Note 9? (I've seen some posts that SIM cards have slight issues when swapped) For me, it worked without a problem, the Note immediately showed the device as a Verizon connected phone. Some of my contacts both iPhone and Android users transferred from my iPhone over to the Note 9, not all of them though - not quite sure why, I just assume that's a Verizon setting perhaps, not a big deal. Text messages worked fine, phone call quality is great. Adding the 128GB Micro SD - same area where the SIM card is located - immediately bumping this to a 256GB phone is also a beautiful thing!So far so good. I'm very happy with this purchase. I do recommend this seller.</br>",2019年10月23日 在美国审核

What a steal at $370 (Bought from Mobile Spree),"PREFACE: I purchased my phone from the Vendor Mobile Spree because I saw the reviews and nobody mentioned who they bought it from which made it difficult to find who was iffy with their Note 9 renewed versions so I had to do some researching. I found Mobile Spree with 9,000+ reviews with a rating thats almost 5 stars, so I went with that vendor so this is a review of Mobile Spree's Renewed Note 9.Review: Mobile Spree phone IS FACTORY UNLOCKED. I used the phone to use with Boost Mobile which means it also works with Sprint. So far its been a great Note 9. It looks almost brand new and works so much faster than my old S7 that I bought new for $600 which is insane to think I paid more for my S7 than I did for a Note 9, $370, THAT WAS 1000 dollars just last year. I didn't set my expectations so high since I knew this was a used phone, not refurbished its a used phone. There was some scratches on the edge of the screen thats like 1 mm long that looks like someone lightly scratched it against a wall or a concrete floor but it is not noticeable when the phone is on. You have to put your face against the phone and look at it in an angle. This was expected of a used phone so its not problem since I got a plastic film screen protector and I can't see the scratch at all anymore even actively looking for it. As for my BIGGEST concern with buying the phone is the battery life and if it would be horrible. I tested it and found it to have 3,600mAh capacity down from the 4,000mAh factory capacity which is great thats 90% of the battery life remaining after 1 year being used. Its so much better than my S7 which only had 57% capacity of its battery left after 3 years of poor battery usage (letting the battery go to 0%, leaving it plugged in over night, charging to 100% all the time, etc) A tip to prolong your battery life is to charge from a low 40% to about 60-70% and you'll keep your battery healthy for almost triple what it would be if you charged to 100% or left your phone plugged charging all night.My disappointment is the fact that the phone didn't come with a ""good"" charger, it came with a generic cord and generic AC adapter not a fast charging adapter. This was expected since the description said it probably wouldn't come with the factor accessories but I still wanted a somewhat good charger. I ended up just buying an Anker AC plug and USB-C cord.",2019年12月11日 在美国审核
Pristine Note 9 factory unlocked,"Hybrid IT sent me exactly what I ordered-a lavender note 9 factory unlocked. It was in pristine condition with no scratches or dings.

Best decision I have made in a long time. I am shocked. I am a tech guy and this phone is perfect. The battery health is at 97 percent. Not a single scratch on either side (I looked with Intense lighting) and every single component (wifi, Bluetooth, speakers, you name it) all work perfectly. I honestly feel like this phone was used maybe once and returned. Even the s-pen has full charge capacity. I could not be more satisfied. I will continue purchasing from this seller in the future!",2021年5月27日 在美国审核
Wonderful - but make sure you choose the right seller,"I've never purchased a renewed phone and wasn't sure what to expect. Most of these phones are sold by multiple sellers - and you can see their ratings on Amazon. I paid a little bit more (literally pennies more) to get it from Hybrid IT and I'm so glad I did. When I got the phone it looked new (no scratches or anything) but the sent the wrong version and the S-pen wasn't working. I was really mad and left a mean review but literally first thing the next morning Mark from Hybrid IT called and made sure I got a replacement by 1 day air. The replacement phone is perfect, and the seller's service was above and beyond my expectations - they could not have been nicer even when I was being a bit of a jerk.So by all means try a renewed phone, you'll pay a fraction of the new price. Just make sure you buy it from a seller with high ratings. I'm biased but I would strongly recommend Hybrid IT. They're a class act.",2020年8月26日 在美国审核

"If you think it isn't unlocked, read this first.","If you think your phone is not unlocked and still on Verizon, read this. Mine was like this and came with the Verizon start up screens, apps and a message saying ""Verizon SIM not inserted"", it was driving me crazy. After completing about 3 or 4 system updates, over about 30 minutes or so, it started booting up with the T-Mobile screen as per my SIM card. So, after all the updates the original carrier branding is gone and the current carrier info is there. Other than that, the phone looks like brand new and it was shipped quickly.

Seems like a brand new phone. Seller was Edge Cellular.,I was very hesitant about buying my refurbished Note 9 after reading all the reviews here. Saying that i decided to not buy the cheapest option and instead got my phone from the seller Edge Cellullar. They had a very good rating from a higher number of total ratings so decide to go with them. It was about $25 more but i could not be more happy.The phone i got is so perfect it makes me think they sent a brand new phone. It is a normal factory unlocked phone with no carrier apps. When i turned it on it was exactly like any other brand new unlocked phone i have bought before with the stock android UI.It also came with a brand new samsung charger and usb-c cable and the data migration plug. It even came with some earbuds even though it says right in the description those are not included. I did not rate the battery life as i just got the phone but otherwise im ecstatic with it so far.,2020年1月28日 在美国审核
Great upgrade from S5,"Received 5/31/19. Writing 6/3/19.Package included an unlocked 512gb Note 9, USB C cable, and a weird low voltage charger. That charger may or may not be normal specs for a new Note 9 but I expected a fast charge adapter.Connected without issue to Google Fi network with a new sim card.For the phone itself, I can't compare to current generation cell phones. Against my Samsung S5 the Note 9 replaced, feels like an entirely different piece of technology after the Android 9 improvements, processor &amp; memory upgrades.The stylus is fun to play with. I like to scribble and love the idea of taking ad-hoc notes without needing to search for paper. Time will tell if it becomes a tool for me, or gimmick.Coming from 16gb to 512gb is like moving out of a studio apartment into a mansion. I'll figure out a way to use up all the space, but right now it's damn roomy.I have a hard time justifying the price, even in the low $600's, when there are brand new phones for hundreds less. Not to say it isn't worth it, comparatively.If you are struggling to make the leap and do nothing more than make calls, text your grandchildren cryptic half messages that make them worried you're having a stroke, and play mahjong on Tuesday's, might want to find another phone.If you enjoy leading tech and can go years with the same phone, this is a good purchase.",2019年6月3日 在美国审核

I do not work for the seller,"First let's address the ""stolen phone"" issue. These phones are not stolen. Amazon would not help sell stolen property. Second. These phones are in fact unlocked. Some do come with bloat wear from a previous carrier. But most do not. What I read in the negative reviews is from people who simply don't know how to set up a Droid device, so they take it to a carrier store. Guess what happens then, the carrier store realizes there's very little money to be made so they tell the customer they can't use the Amazon device. And try to sell them a new carrier branded phone. My device is basically brand new. No carrier bloatwear. No scratches dings or dents. And it works flawlessly. After about 20 updates. Which also tells me its never been assigned a carrier. And even in 2022 the Note 9 is still a great phone. And I couldn't be happier with the purchase. The shipping speed , quality of the device. Its all 9.9/10. This is a great phone.

Perfectly Satisfied! (T-mobile customer),"Despite many of the poor reviews, I took a chance on this purchase and I have been suitably impressed! Yes, the box it comes in is not a branded Samsung phone box, and the fast charger is not a branded Samsung charger, but who cares? The charger works (and is now in a drawer with all the other chargers) and the box is in the trash already. The phone is flawless! Not a scratch or fingerprint anywhere. Included in the box was a return sticker so if I was not satisfied, it was ready to return immediately.I am a T-mobile customer and I was dismayed to see the Verizon logo display on the screen on the initial boot up. I had put my T-mobile sim in the phone before the first boot so I was thinking ""ah crap, going to have to return it"" but the phone displayed a message something to the effect of ""do you want to reset the phone?"" which displayed over the standard Android new phone experience wizard you would expect to see when starting a new phone. I clicked on ""yes"" and the phone restarted. It displayed the Android logo with the two arrows slowly spinning for about 15 seconds, then the phone restarted and BAM! There was the T-mobile logo with the T-mobile startup jingle! I didn't know it would do that!The phone connected to my T-mobile network without a hitch. T-mobile wifi calling works perfectly. I use a YubiKey 5 Series dongle to secure my mobile devices and instead of needing the USB-C adapter to plug into the phone, I was prompted to place the key on the back of the phone. That was all it needed! The NFC worked perfectly.Before the end of the day, this new phone received 3 updates, the last update taking the OS to Android 10. Nice!All this for $350!

Great Phone,"I'm not going to lie—I was very leery about getting this phone. This was the first time I had ever bought a phone (up until now, I was just using hand me downs that had been given to me by family members that had upgraded) and I wanted to be sure I was getting something worth my money, especially when the asking price was around $400 (not including taxes, which were a whopping $40). I read the reviews, both negative and positive. The negative ones were mainly published by people who had purchased the phone expecting it to be factory unlocked and it wasn't, which resulted in them having a phone that was locked to a different carrier other than the one they had. I have Verizon Straight Talk, and I figured if I got a Verizon locked phone that my SIM card would work with it, so I ordered one that was Verizon locked instead of factory unlocked.It came within 3-4 days and looks brand new. Other than the barcode sticker on the back, it appears to be brand new and not refurbished. After getting it on and connected to the WiFi, I pulled the Verizon Straight Talk SIM card out of my old phone and popped it into the new one. It started working immediately and has been ever since. I've now a case and a protective screen on it to keep it as safe as possible. It has been and currently is working great.

"Great price, Great Phone, Hard to activate service.","I got my phone from CR Daily Deals. I will have to say I am quite impressed for the price. The charger was generic, and they don't include the tool to remove the sim card tray or headphones. The phone looked brand new other than some adhesive that was stuck to the top of the phone I'm guessing this was from a screen replacement. It took some time to get setup with my service. I noticed some people saying it was locked out. When I put my sim card in the phone it said this device is not on a registered network. To fix this I did a factory reset. This also did not work at first. After trying a factory reset I called my phone provider and told them I would like to change to an unlocked phone and use the same sim card. They asked for the IMEI# and a few other things and set it up on there end. After speaking with my carrier and transfering phones on there end I did one last factory reset so the phone would recognize the carrier change and when it powered back on everything was working and the phone has better service than my old phone.

Note 9 is a great choice for a bargain,"This phone may be 2 generations old now, but boy can this thing fly. I bought this for my brother-in-law and I had him report back of things he likes and dislikes and his review was very glowing:Pros:- Battery life, even under heavy usage he usually has to charge it by days end and sometimes after a day and a half.- Screen. This thing is beautiful. The note 9 has a huge screen and the color is so vibrant.- The stylus: It is crazy to me this is a pro because Samsung seems to be killing off the note line. There is so much functionality here from taking pictures, jotting notes, and if you are feeling creative doodling.- Audio jack: This still has a physical audio jack and it is the last phone with it from Samsung.- Gaming: My brother-in-law loves playing PUBG and he says playing on this is so smooth. I prefer a controller or keyboard myself. But if your looking to game on a phone this one can handle it like a champ!=======================================Cons:- He isn't a fan of the curved screen, but all Samsung phones have this. At this point if you don't want a curved screen you have to look somewhere else.- Fingerprints. This phone shows fingerprints shockingly easily, but most do.==============Overall: If you can't tell by now this phone is a winner. For as cheap as it is now you can't lose.

Exactly as advertised.,"I purchased this Note as a secondary device for work productivity and Google Home integration (my iPhone does neither very well). I'm not entirely sure what kind of problems some of the other reviewers were having with getting their service to work, but I can assure you that this is an unlocked handset. It came out of the box with Verizon carrier settings, and all I did was put my Mint Mobile SIM in and it auto-loaded the T-Mobile (backbone for Mint) carrier settings and rebooted. Worked instantly. It even automatically deleted the Verizon bloatware and replaced it with the T-Mobile bloatware! :)As far as the device itself goes, you get what you pay for. This is a renewed device, and there are caveats that go with the purchase of said type of device. Having said that though, it looked and ran like a brand new handset right out of the box. No issues with performance whatsoever. The screen was in perfect condition. The only MINOR physical imperfection is the way the bottom of the screen meets with the steel frame of the phone. Nothing broken, scratched, or loose. I THINK the screen has possibly been replaced, and something just couldn't be re-aligned like it was originally in manufacturing. It should definitely be noted that I had to LOOK to find this. The average person who isn't insane, like myself, would never notice it.The last note (haha) is the battery condition. According to AccuBattery, the battery is around 84% capacity. This is a renewed device that I paid $365 for which originally sold for $1000 just over a year ago.

Exceeded Expectations but Winding Path to Get to Purchase,"My experience with the Note 9 has been very good. It has been by far the best smart device phone that I have owned. I have had it about 4 months.To create context, I almost went with the Pixel 3, but the whole ""notch"" discussion plus the product cycle and limited distribution gave me hesitation. My Note 8 which I owned for over 2 years was a disaster. The screen tension was horrible which led to many micro-fractures. It lacked durability. The battery life was horrible and Samsung pushes an incredible amount of bloatware at you. Also there is no good reason to use Bixby and Samsung keeps pushing that at you as well which affects usability and customer experience. Samsung almost lost me.I wasn't predisposed to getting the Note 9.But i did.The Note 9 in my experience has been everything that the Note 8 was not - durable, long battery life, fast processing, great photo quality etc. The 128G version is just fine and can be extended if necessary with a micro sd. Why would anyone put more than 128G on their phone? I purchased a ""refurbished"" from a reseller, in an unlocked version to keep the cost down, and as it turned out it worked just fine. But transferring the SIM chip and doing the restore I was operational pretty quickly.I can now recommend the Note 9 with a clear conscience. A solid device... The alternative that could be considered is the One Plus 6 T. I did a little research post purchase and the 6T stood out for both cost and design. It seems like it would be a viable alternative. It is only distributed through T-mobile or online.But Note 9 is good for my purposes, specifically a mix of business and personal. Hopefully this can help you.",2019年3月10日 在美国审核

Fantastic!!,"I've been meaning to write this positive review for 3 months because all the negative reviews almost deterred me from what is by far my best purchase ever from Amazon! I didn't want a hard inquiry on my credit and a monthly payment to finance a cell phone through my wireless carrier. Everything was perfect about this purchase!! I received a *flawless* Galaxy Note 9 with a Samsung stylus and USB-C charger; the only difference from ""brand new"" was the plain box. There was not a single scratch or blemish on the phone or screen and I had no issues with the phone reading my TMOBILE SIM (this seems to be most people's chief complaint, and a small amount of time and research could surely rectify this issue). It was completely plug and play and I still cannot believe I got a phone this nice for less than $400. Fast shipping, perfect product, I am very, very pleased with this purchase.",2020年1月15日 在美国审核
"2022 customer, it works!","I ordered the midnight black one and it came in quickly. Everything was new, with no scratches or single dust on it. I powered it on and tried to insert my old phone sims card to it to activate it but it didn't work which quickly made me worry if the phone was locked or if I got scammed. (Tmobile sims btw) and I later found out I had to actually call T-Mobile and request it. It ended up working after I got off the phone and I transferred my data over and everything. So it's working now perfectly. I know some people think it's locked liked I did but try calling your carrier and request to transfer it through them. Everything else I tried didn't work and I almost gave up. Just do this method if you having that problem.",2022年3月11日 在美国审核
"This is how I feel about my first Amazon ""renewed"" phone purchase...","(I wanted to show you guys a picture but I only have one phone and Amazon wouldn't let me upload the pic from the order--so use your imagination -- it is a Lavender Samsung Galaxy Note 9, with a Lavender stylus. Looks brand new)I have never ordered a phone from Amazon. I feel like everything is a huge warehouse which can make for easy mistakes on a small order. But I was NOT disappointed by my purchase. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Note 9, 128GB, Lavender Purple - For T-Mobile (Renewed) -- I was going to opt for an unlocked, but I felt like it would just make life difficult if it wasn't compatible with my network in some way -- I knew I was not changing carriers so may as well go with my current carrier.When I first got my phone at first I thought something was wrong with the screen because on one side of the phone it required more pressure than the other side to operate properly. I thought it might have been the screen protector I put on it (it's a thicker one that blocks side-eye views of the phone) but then I realized the settings FOR screen protectors to allow for more touch sensitivity had to be turned on (still not sure why only 1 side was effected, but at least this setting being activated was the solution for the entire phone).The phone came with the specified GB and features.Great reception/strong signal -- meaning no dropped calls in areas where I don't normally have calls dropped calls.Zero issues being compatible with TMobile. It took the rep less than 10 minutes to sync my phone to the carrier and switch over everything from my old phone to my new phone.Stylus is fine.. it sometimes says that it's low on connectivity when I haven't used it long, but the functionality is still there so I don't worry about it.The price for this phone came at the PERFECT time in my situation.It was probably priced lower because it is a lavender phone. But I bought a black case for it, so don't let a color you don't like deter you. To protect these investments we're going to get a case anyway so save money and buy a less desired color like I did.Everyone couldn't believe I got it for this low--- no other online retailer had this price with this type of guarantee which is why I risked it. And I'm glad I did.I waited over a month to create the review so that I could really ensure the phone's operational consistency. And I am not disappointed. Gets 5 stars for shipping, accuracy of description, pricing, and quality of phone.Thanks again.",2021年9月13日 在美国审核

Whats Not to Like? NOTHING !,This is not my first Note 9 nor dare I say will it be the last as we use them in business. We have used these phones as portable computers as well as phones and the Note 9 shines in all the ways we need it too. We have had and have both the 512g and the 128g and they have done the job equally well with the 512g being only a tiny bit faster than the 128g. No problems with battery life or performance and in fact no short comings at all so far. This is why we continue to buy and use them. They are now less than half the price of what they were and for us a better value than the the 2 newer models with less features. These are rock solid phones and believe the best bang for the buck giving up Nothing!,2020年1月13日 在美国审核

"Works with Verizon, Read Below","Works with Verizon but you'll need to have a micro SIM already on-hand.I bought this phone but only had a regular SIM card available. I went to Verizon and they refused to give me a micro SIM for this phone since ""it's not compatible"". However, I had another phone that took a micro SIM card available and got a new micro SIM registered to that device.Once I was out of Verizon, I swapped the new SIM into this phone and it works perfectly.So, either have an micro SIM already registered or you will need to have a ""Verizon Compatible"" phone available to get a new micro SIM registered to your account.Not sure why Verizon insists on having your SIM tied to a ""Verizon Compatible"" device, even if the device supports their CDMA network.Phone was in great condition.

"Great Phone, Absolutely Stupid Design","I have been using computers since the 70s when I was in college and purchased my first IBM clone in 1992, and was using PDAs very early on.I had one of the first Windows smart phones but got rid of it in favor of a flip phone.....why?As a physician, I had been tied to a pager for years, and I really hated trying to do anything with such a small screen.I never jumped on the iPhone bandwagon either.Finally, as the screen sizes have increased, I decided, ok, there are apps that I may find useful as well as the integration of my Google Calander and Contacts with my phone.But, while sure, I could spend over a grand on a new phone, it just did not seem to me to be a wise use of my money.I had read that a lot of smartphone addict aficionados look for the latest and greatest.....or maybe they did not like the color of their new phone....so they sent it back.Rather than winding up in landfills as a lot of returned Amazon merchandise does, unfortunately, Amazon was wise enough to create their refurbished division in which various refurbishers compete for customer's business.I thought, why not give it a try.I purchased the phone from a company named Kiss in Manhattan where I grew up.They had a high positive rating so I picked themMy phone arrived the next day despite the fact that I did not pay for overnight shipping.Unfortunately, as I understand it, the ripples of the COVID situation put them out of business.As for the phone, when I opened up the box, I was shocked.In terms of appearance, there was absolutely no way I would have known it was a refurb....not a mark on it.As far as function is concerned, I used various apps to test it, and it passed.I have been using it since the first week of August.My estimate of battery life remaining is upwards of 90 percent.Of note, at Batteries and Bulbs, I can replace the battery for something like 70 dollars still putting me way ahead of the game since the phone was under 400 dollars.Add a Microcenter 512 MicroSD card for about 50 dollars and I have a phone with 3/4 of a terabyte, far more storage than I anticipate ever using.So, why the 4 stars?The phone is very elegant looking, especially with its curved display.As such, it would look very nice put upon a pedestal in our living room.However, I did not find the phone in an art store.I purchased it to use every day as my mobile phone.What is the Note 9 made of?Simply put, it is basically glass placed over a metal frame which again is fine if you want to display it on your bookshelf, but not particularly practical.Unless a person is downright foolish, just about everyone puts a case on it.You can forget about using one of those clear cases that let the beauty of the phone shine through.Drop it and you are facing an expensive repair.I was using the Unicorn Beetle Pro case with a belt clip which I never used.The phone dropped on the stairs and the inner part of the case broke.I was not really upset about that for the simple reason it saved the phone.Now I am trying an Outbox Defender which looks pretty robust.How about the curved display?Yes, it looks rather elegant, but does one really need it for functionality?The answer is absolutely not.It only serves to make designing a screen protector problematic.As for screen protectors go, I think they are necessary and I have just resigned myself to the fact that the edge adhesives are going to wear out and to simply replace them every once and awhile.They are not particularly expensive.We as consumers really should not put up with this nonsense.Most of the smartphones made these days have similar designs.They reinforce the notion of built-in obsolescence, or in actuality, built-in fragility.Yes, technology changes very rapidly.But, the basic technology of how these phones communicate does not.There is absolutely no reason that we should have to get a new phone every year.They should last far longer than that in my humble opinion.The question is how can we communicate this to the manufacturers?We can't boycott them because they all pretty much do the same thing. It is something it think about.....just saying.",2020年11月3日 在美国审核

You're phone will work then. It is completely unlocked. Will work with any carrier. Came with stylus and phone charger. Buttons a little rough you have to press down firmly.

Great phone I'm back in the game,"I have seen some reviews where people have had problems with the phones they have received. I am happy to say I have had none of these. Pros: Fast shipping and phone came on time, phone look like new . The phone was unlocked none of the phone service bloat ware (my service is AT&amp;T) only Samsung and Google apps which can also be deleted if you so chose. Battery life seems good came in with a 40-50%charge. S-pen fully functional new and Samsung branded. I just popped in my sim card and service was ready to go. Great value for the money.Cons: Phone was not the ocean blue like my other one it was darker and more purple looking (side note this could be because it was a newer version of the phone and has darker paint it was also ever so slightly smaller then my original note 9) but who cares I put a case on it anyway. Came with generic chargerand wasn't a adaptive fast charger ethier. All in all very good buy will buy from them again........Pro tip mine came with the voice assistance turned on which messes with things when trying to initially set up the phone just skip through the Google and Samsung set up stuff get to the main screen go turn off voice assistance then update the phone then you can set up all the things like Google, Samsung accounts lock screen ect with no issue. Also if the touch is not working well during the set up use the S-pen to navigate..this is due to the phone trying to download updates while you are also trying to set it up..hope this helps ",2019年11月26日 在美国审核
First Impressions,"It's only been a few hours since I received this phone but I couldn't wait to post a review! I was super skeptical about ordering a phone online like this but I'm glad I did. First of all, I got the package way earlier than the expected delivery date which was awesome. Phone works great, I've noticed 0 problems so far. I saw in the phone information it said the brand was Sprint so I was initially worried it wasn't truly unlocked. But it activated no problem! I got a BYOP sim card kit from Straight Talk and used the Verizon sim card. Had no problem whatsoever! I absolutely love the phone itself. It's much bigger than the galaxy s8 I had and I love the stylus! It's super cool, and you can program the button on it to open an app. Lots of other cool features like the wide selfie and gif recorder (smart select S pen tool). I'm sure there's a lot I haven't even gotten into. No cracks or scratches. Can't quite comment on the battery life yet since I'm still on the first charge. The charging port looks a little worn but it works. The charger was off brand but I suppose I saved enough on the phone to splurge for a fast charging cord. ♀ Overall very happy.I will definitely update my review if I find any problems, but for now I am pleasantly surprised!",2020年9月3日 在美国审核
Been using this for almost a year now,"I thought it was a really good deal, a note9 for $420. It really was, never had any issues with it unless I keep it on and don't restart it once every 1.5-2 weeks it will slow down and have some issues. But other than that, all functions work properly and won't probably upgrade until next year as it is not giving me any issues at all. Facial recognition and the fingerprint sensor work seamlessly. The amount of options you have to customize how all the buttons work and other motions and how things work in general is amazing, haven't bought an iPhone since the 5S came out and am definitely never going back to iOS. You can get so much more out of an android phone, specially the Note series from Samsung, plus not to mention all the varieties of other phones that run Android, so many to pick and all so different.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核
Pleasantly surprised,"No incentive to write this review, just wanted to because I myself scan a million reviews before ordering everything.I broke my note 8 that I got for free and didn't want to spend a fortune on a new phone. I first ordered the moto stylus 2021 since its semi comparable and costs less but its way to big for my liking. Then I tried the 2020 version. The size was perfect but there's no notification light (sounds like a stupid gripe but important to me) and a few other things that made me miss my Samsung. I didn't even necessarily need the 9 but for the price why not. I kept the moto 2020 until my renewed Note 9 came in just in case, as I was super nervous about getting a renewed phone but when I tell you this thing looks perfect I mean it. Not a visible scratch on it, front or back. The fingerprint part is slightly and visibly worn but that's it. The phone does get hot sometimes but I can't tell if its any fault to being renewed or just is what it is. The phone is absolutely beautiful, the sound is amazing and a big upgrade from the 8. I got the lavender, which is a different tone from the 8 and I love this color version even more than the last. Shipping was to be between the 15-18 and it came the 15th ..and maybe the best part for me personally was that I was able to transfer everything from one Samsung to the other in 10 minutes with Smart Switch. I was struggling with this part with the other brand and it was essential because of the things I had stored.Would absolutely recommendordering from here, and just incase, you have a good return period if anything does go wrong. Make sure you're not ordering renewed from a knock off place..those will probably not offer a return date. Super happy with this phone. Thankful I took the risk.",2021年9月20日 在美国审核

WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO BUY THIS??,"Arrived quickly!!! This was a renewed device, so I didn't expect it to look brand new.The reviews I read mentioned not having the necessary accessories in the box. Package arrives its in a generic white box and I was pleased to see a Samsung charger and a pin to open memory card/storage compartment. The only flaw I could see was a small scratch on the glass, if you tilt it in the sunlight at the right angle. When the screen in on I can't even see it. Battery seems fine charges really fast. This is my first high end phone, I've always been too cheap to get something decent, I love it!!! I don't see any reason to spend more for a new one, save your money and get one of these.",2019年11月3日 在美国审核

So Far Works Great,"Arrived earlier than expected.As far as I can tell it works great. I just need to learn how this one works better since I went from a 4 to a 9.A lot more features.Only problem I had was the sim card from my old Note would not fit, but went up to the Verizon store and they took care of that for me and helped me get it set up and contacts added (at no charge).",2022年1月27日 在美国审核
Went from Note 5 to Note 9 with no regrets.,"I loved my Note 5 but after the Note 10 came out, I realized the 5 was starting to show its age.To be sure, I could replace the battery and probably get a couple more decent years out of the 5 but it wasn't getting any more Android updates and I could tell it was getting a little slower to launch apps.However I didn't want to spend upwards of a $1,000 on the shiny new Note 10.It didn't help that my wife had already upgraded her Note 5 to an 8.So after some soul searching and web searching for a good priced, gently used Note 9, I decided on this one.So far it's amazing!The battery life is easily double that of the 5 and apps snap open.The only thing I miss so far is the Flipboard/Briefing that was available on the 5 by swiping right.Instead there's Bixby now, but maybe I just need to customize and get used to it.The Note 9 itself arrived in near new condition.The screen is crystal clear with no scuffs or scratches, the back has a slight scuff which disappears when I put the clear case/cover on.",2019年9月4日 在美国审核
Basically brand new!,"The seller listed all the details about what a refurbished phone is and what to expect, but even then my expectations were met and more. No scratches, dings, booted up perfectly, battery lasts forever. The only thing missing was the stylus, so I just bought one separately, and it connected perfectly with the phone. It also came with a screen protector already on, though I opted to switch it out for a different type.Overall, this was a great buy!",2021年6月29日 在美国审核
Please read if you are metro,Am a long term metro cust and totally new to the unlocked phone scene. So was overjoyed when I hooked it up to wifi and had it working wonderfully. Google assistant was good and phone generally seemed impressive. Was then equally pissed off when I plunked in my metro card and Sim was not working. I was under impression it would work fine out of box. Anyhow I contacted the seller Wireless warehouse USA and they advised I needed to notify metro of the phones imee number (or similar) to get it to work on their network. So so took it in and paid $16.00 and now I have a kick ass flag ship phone for a bargain price. Working perfectly so far. This one is a keeper.

Best Renewed Phone Supplier,"Upgraded from a renewed Note 5 (one of the best phones ever) to the Note 9 128GB.I upgraded for:1. Better battery life (Note 5 battery was showing signs of failing)2. More RAM.3. Internal storage increase and MicroSD slot.4. Stronger in every way.I spent a good amount of time deciding which Note to upgrade to (RIP Note 7). The Note 9 turned out to be the best for the price (and the price for this renewed Note 9 had dropped over $100 by the time I actually got around to making the purchase).I selected renewed, NOT the renewed premium, and the Note 9 I received might as well be brand new.

Good refurbished product,"There are plenty of places to find reviews of the device itself - my short summary would be that this is still a great flagship, even in 2020.But the main focus here is that this is a refurbished unit.

No scratches or even smudges - you really couldn't tell it wasn't brand new.After a few months of use, I see no indication of any issues with this device.Considering the low price and great condition of the phone, I'd say this is a great choice for anyone looking for a large and powerful phone on a budget.",2020年10月3日 在美国审核

Highly sceptical to highly surprised and satisfied!!,"I wasn't sure about buying a refurbished phone online. Will it really work? Will it really be fully unlocked? Will it have scratches and dings? Well, I received my phone 3 days early and I can't even tell it's used! Swapped my sim card and wait..... It worked just as easy as that!!!! After playing with the phone for a while I noticed the S pen wouldn't connect so I thought, here we go.... I contacted Hybrid IT (the seller) the next day through Amazon and they responded in less than 5 minutes. They gave me a choice of an immediate refund of enough to buy a new s pen on my own (if I was in a hurry) or to ship me a new one no questions asked. I chose to let them send me a new one and low and behold I had a tracking number 5 minutes later. My new pen arrived in 2 days and works perfectly.

Contacted the seller to see if they sold replacements and they are sending out a replacement for free even though it's not under warranty, and have no obligation to do so. Please anyone reading this support this business while saving money, phones are expensive. This has been the best experience on Amazon, the internet, and probably earth as a whole.

May have to jump through hoops,"Well this phone is factory Verizon unlocked....I purchased it to switch h from straight talk to Verizon prepay however when I tried to activate the phone over the internet it said that the phone was not compatible with the Verizon network<br>Ok frustration sinks in, I call the seller and believe it or not the women on the other end was knowledgable, stating that the phone is in fact comparable with any network and that this isn't the first time this has happened.Ths reasoning is I did not buy the phone from Verizon so they lie to get you to buy a phone off of them, and if I went to a store and explained the situation that the phone would get activated...I have a family member who is in corporate for Verizon wireless and his comment was ""this is probably true""...So not wanting to go to the store I popped out my straight talk sim card from my old phone into this new note 9 and it works perfectly...so f Verizon, the item shipped in 2 days and thecustomer service was good....just be cautious you may need to jump through some hoops however its probably the cheapest you can get this phone</br>",2019年2月1日 在美国审核
Incredible Value,"My Galaxy Note 9 (Ocean Blue) arrived two days after ordering. It was packed a little loosely within its smaller box but survived the trip without apparent issue. The generic charging block/cable are functional. Minimal signs of wear are faded paint surrounding the charging port (from blind plugging no doubt) and a barely worn stylus tip. Completely functional device, no loose buttons or internal rattling, battery life easily beating my old Galaxy S8.

Better than described,"Shipped fast and was better than described by seller. The phone is a refurb and the marring and scratches described are so slight they are tough to find.

Took us 3 T-mobile stores to find one and 10 bucks in change. Once we had right Sim, phone works great!! So happy to finally get an upgrade.",2020年8月22日 在美国审核

Pretty good but minor scuffs and not factory unlocked.,"The phone I received had 2 small scuffs on the screen, like it was dropped on concrete but didn't crack the screen, there's one in the bottom right corner that is pretty visible but just off of the screen so it doesn't matter, and the other one is a bit smaller but on the screen, though when the screen is on you can't see it so it's not a deal breaker or a reason to send it back.Other than that it has some small surface scratches (who tf doesn't put a screen protector on a brand new phone?) but those aren't visible with the screen on either and I applied a screen protector to stop any of them from getting worse.This isn't a factory unlocked phone either as when starting it up it had the sprint logo and the model number is a sprint phone, but as soon as I put a tracphone sim in it updated the carrier and got rid of the sprint startup logo (didn't know that was possible to get rid of), so it's definitely an unlocked phone now as all carriers are required to unlock phones after a contract is up and even though it's not a factory unlocked phone you should have no issues, if you do have any just get a replacement cause this is a fantastic deal for this powerhouse of a phone.NOTE: My seller was Hybrid IT, the different sellers are all different refurbishers so if you get a bad phone return it for a refund and buy it from a different seller, most are around the same price anyhow.",2019年11月18日 在美国审核

So long story short, this is a useless phone that cannot be unlocked until the original owner pays it off.I was pretty much sold a brick for 600.00.This seller should not be allowed to sell things on here if they don't have to common sense to make sure the phone is useable first.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核

Best value for an Android power user on a budget,"I've had mine just three days but it is the best smart phone purchase decision. I will never again spend outrageous money on the latest smart phone every two years (this replaces a 4+ year old 32GB Note 5 I dropped $699 on). I'm sure most have done their homework on this phone for specs, features, and performance including camera, so I won't go into features detail and instead focus on condition and personal impression. This refurb I got is in impeccable condition. Not a single scratch anywhere except a small one where someone opened the sim/SD card slot. I mean it looks brand new. After the recommended full charge before powering on, I swapped my sim card from the Note 5 (T-Mobile), and ran through the initial setup and file sync (took about an hour for 25+ GB of data from the Note 5 to move over via the wireless option on my home WiFi). It was just like setting up a brand new phone at the store.I love the ocean blue color with the yellow S-pen. It reminds me of a Blue Angel jet. A quick battery check from a test shows it is solid and rated at the full factory spec 4,000mAh. WiFi streaming music for a couple of hours didn't drain it nearly as fast as what happens with my Note 5's 3,000mAh. Besides cosmetic flaws, I was worried about the condition of the battery as you never know how the previous owner treated the phone regarding battery management. Unlike some others, my phone did not come in the original case and just had some generic USB-C charging cord. However it is the fast version for connecting to the wall. It's just not the official white Samsung unit that came with it from the factory. It works just as well as I was charging it before power up from the wall.Overall, I cannot be happier and the fact that Samsung (and Apple) are now charging $1K plus for their high end smart phones is outrageous and I refuse to spend that much. Another ""proper motivator"" for me in taking this direction was that I can install a MicroSD card up to 512GB in the same slot as the sim chip, which the Note 10 does not have in the North America markets (you have to move up to the 10+ for that). I'm not paying $150 more for the 10+ on top of an already outrageous price point just to get an SD slot (don't want the larger screen on top of that). The other good thing is that the 3.5mm audio jack is still there for wired headsets and buds. I don't want wireless as yet something else to charge no matter how ""cool"" they look. Never mind we still don't know long term brain health effects of Bluetooth.Finally, I did order a case that I also highly recommend for this if you are into a minimalist design made by FITFORT for only $15. These phones are not going to be around for much longer in such great condition in the next couple of years, and they likely will not get less expensive as I'm seeing even my old Note 5 in refurb form going for $300+ here. So if you want to upgrade an older Note or Galaxy from few series back but don't like the price or removed features of the Note 10 and Galaxy S10 over their previous generation, this is what you want. I see myself keeping this phone 3-4 years just like my 2015-era Note 5 and I actually paid nearly half as much for it.",2020年1月22日 在美国审核

Great product!,"Everything came as described and expected. The phone was in great condition with the plastic wrap still around it. The charger and its block were included. As stated in the title the phone is unlocked and mine worked just fine, I just popped my sim card in and got on with setting up the phone. The item came in a generic white box instead of its original box, which I didn't expect it to. I switched from an iPhone 6s to this and so far it is exceeding my expectations. I love the large display, the camera is speedy with great quality. Of course there are certain features that I miss from my iPhone but so far the Note 9 has enough of its own features to make me become a convert. If you've done research about the Note 9 you are aware of Bixby. I am not a fan so I downloaded an app to disable the feature. I do wish the buttons on the left side of the phone (Bixby and volume) were better positioned, because I think they're too far up but definitely not a deal breaker. All in all, this is a great phone and the certified refurbished option makes it an even more enticing option if you're looking to upgrade.",2018年11月24日 在美国审核

No problems with Note9,"I bought my used Note9 from the seller, Re-Cell.I upgraded from a Note3.Along with others, I think it's important that reviews name the seller as the ""adds"" seem to change sellers, so reviews are all clumped together from different sellers.The phone looks 99% new.I pulled the IMEI number and did a search to very authentic samsung phone and also to see where made as I did not made in China phone, even if used.No problems.All functions seem to work great, I have not found any issues or problems.Phone is fast, and the screen is awesome. Videos are amazing, I was very surprised at the clarity of the videos and the quality of the pictures. But, as I mentioned, I am upgrading from a Note3, which is still to me a really great phone.The Note9 battery seems to be little weak but still makes it through the day without a charge.The add states battery to be at 80% + strength, which probably is. I realize the the Note9 has a bigger battery and that was important to me, I'll still give battery life 5 star as I feel that's what Samsung gets for putting a nice big battery in there that can last all day.My phone is 18 months old according to the imei check.I did not test the fingerprint option.Overall very pleased and would not hesitate to buy a used phone again from Re-Cell.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核

It was Unlocked out of the Box,"I always wanted a Note phone since I got my first Galaxy phone over six years ago. Luckily with Amazon Renewed I was able to snag a Note 9 for under $400. I really wanted the Note for the S-Pen, that was the only feature my Galaxy S9+ did not have. The release of the Note 10 was a major disappointment for me which was one of the main reasons I looked at the year-old flagship Note 9. Unlikethe Note 10 which took several steps back, the Note 9 has the headphone jack, dedicated Bixby button (Extremely useful for remapping for various functions), MicroSD card support, and a fingerprint sensor on the back. All features I need as a power user.I was pleasantly surprised when I received the product and found it to be in near flawless condition with only minor scratches that aren't noticeable unless you explain the phone closely. The stylus was there and works well. The battery was in good condition and like-new. When I turned on the phone I knew it was running the unlocked firmware since I am also running the unlocked firmware for my Galaxy S9+ and it has no carrier bloatware. When I put my T-mobile SIM card it worked nearly instantly.After using it for two weeks there has been no problems with it so far, all features seem to be working as intended.I can safely say this is the best phone I have ever used and may be the best Note Samsung may ever produce.",2019年11月28日 在美国审核

"Looked brand new, but had issues","I was blown away at how crisp and new the phone appeared. The battery life met my expectations, therefore I was happy in that regard. Had no issues with wireless charging. However, the s-pen was dirty and had some nasty grime on it which I cleaned -- not that a big deal, but I suppose something to note. After that was managed I began to setup the phone. During the setup process I noticed a couple of times that I thought I pushed the screen to select a specific letter/number, but either nothing happened or the click selected a different letter/number. For the most part (approximately 98% of the time) the touch screen functioned as expected so I didn't completely pay attention to this intermittent issue until I used the phone for a couple of days where it became noticeable.Next thing I noticed happen to involve calling into a line where touch dial was needed to select options. Sometimes I was unable to select an option although in the call app it showed I selected a number. In addition, I had a 100% reoccurring issue with calling into a support line to receive a text to verify identification, but when I would swap back and forth from text to call again the call would not detect I selected a number. After this would occur, to remedy the issue sometimes closing and re-opening would provide a temporary solution. If that did not work I would have to power cycle the device for another temporary solution. For a workaround I would have to turn the phone sideways (landscape) to see the code that was sent to me so I could stay in the call without swapping over to my text messages to see the code.Lastly, the USB-C port was not consistent with charging or connecting to my laptop/PC for charging although the interface would click in place as it were securely connected. This issue occurred approximately 90% of the time which is highly noticeable. Sometimes thephone would not detect that I attached outlet power to it (approximately 5% - 15% occurrence). I initially thought my power adapter and or cord were the problem. I swapped both of those out, but the problem persist. In addition, when I connect to a laptop/PC via USB-C the phone is constantly detected over and over. Even if I deny the USB access the phone again is detected over and over. I tried this with a personal and work laptop, as well as my home PC which all shared the same result.I got to this last point then decided to return the phone as I know issues would have persist or become worse overtime. This is unfortunate because I was excited to continue using a Note style phone. My friends and family use iphone's. After recent discussions I finally caved in and decided to give an iphone a shot. I hope all the hype for these phones stands true.",2021年9月10日 在美国审核

Without official Samsung Stylus it inhibits some functionality of the phone. This is the reason I bought the Note in the first place. The stylus is not an accessory. It is part of the phone.

Best renewed phone with oem accessories!,"I'm impressed, bought this note 9 128gb (black Verizon ver.) a month ago from these guys with fear of recieving a used, scratched up phone with off brand charger and no accessories in a white box like others offered on Amazon. WELL I WAS WRONG!!! I received a original samsung box with everything it came with from factory in factory sealed plastic!!! Sin card pin, S-pen tips/Remover, original charger and cable, AKG headphones (sealed-new oem), charging port headphone adapter, and transfer cable!!! All ""OEM"". I was shocked!! Then with my OCD i checked the condition of the phone under a magnifying glass and light, not a SINGLE SCRATCH on the front, and only 2 very fine, almost invisible scratches on the back. Around the Bezels/Edges of the phone still had the OEM plastic liner/cover without a nick or signs of use. Overall I feel as if I scored big time and was lucky with the draw but then again, lots of other reviews for this purchase state similar experiences. Now last but not least, I waited a month to write this review for this renewed note 9 because I wanted to test the battery health and life. Phone holds a charge all day with continued use (I own a Business) as if it was new. I'd give the condition and phone accessories a 10/10 and the battery health a 9/10 for a supposedly used/renewed phone. Save yourself 500 bucks and buy from GoOverstock. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",2019年8月10日 在美国审核

Super Duper Happy!,"Thank you Hybrid IT! I was at first apprehensive about purchasing a used phone off Amazon or anywhere online with all the bad experiences I've read about, but I'm glad I took the chance, because I'm loving my Galaxy Note 9. It looks practically new! All it had was a tiny nick on the bottom corner which is barely noticeable. I ran the IMEI and I was happy to find out it is a clean phone. I'll probably be trading it in down the road for a note 10 plus, but for now I'm Super Duper happy with this purchase. Phone looks beautiful, it works wonderfully and I had no issues connecting it to my AT&amp;T service and transferring everything even though I am tech ignorant. It also was well secured in the package and it arrived in a timely manner. I had to pick it up from Fedex, but that's because the driver was too lazy to deliver to my apt now that the leasing office is not accepting packages during Covid. Anyways, that's no fault of the seller, but I would suggest maybe using UPS or Amazon delivery instead, FedEx falls short sometimes. Welp, that's my 2 cents. Hope this helps others who may want to take the leap. Just be carefully what seller your buying from. I will definitely be purchasing other items for Hybrid IT!",2020年8月16日 在美国审核

SIM card matters,"First, the phone received is like new - no, and I mean no, visible usage are all! The phone came with the Samsung box, complete, like a new phone. Second, and this is for those who posted reviews about not getting the proper provider phone; this may be helpful for such future incidents. If you ordered an unlocked phone, which my supplier advertised, it is possible that a different cell provider may come up after initial boot of phone - don't be alarmed. My example, I ordered a Verizon phone, but my supplier (Amazon) also indicated the phone was unlocked, this means not locked into a specific cell provider; after fully charging the phone it booted as a T-mobile phone - NOT A PROBLEM - why - SIM Card. Power off the new phone and insert the SIM card from your old phone into your new phone, the phone will reset, there will be a couple of messages, OK, etc. Once the new phone resets it will then boot using you cell vendor phone boot process; in my case, Verizon. Hope this helps. Also, I want to say again, I am very pleased with my new NOTE9. This vendor delivered as advertised. Sidebar: The process to migrate my old phone to my new phone was a snap. Samsung makes the process very easily with its automated software process.",2020年5月5日 在美国审核

I regret purchasing a phone from Amazon and also this seller,"I purchased a Note 9 from this seller in October. After about 1.5 months from the purchase the phone started acting up when I connected my headphones to it. I thought there was something wrong with my headphones so I changed a few headphones but it didn't resolve the issue. I contacted the seller to replace the phone afterwards and they refused to do it and said it was a few days after the warranty period.Also when purchasing the phone I chose the option of installments with no interest to pay for the phone, I checked it multiple times and made sure that I had selected that option when checking out. But after a month they started charging interest on my credit card. When I contacted Amazon they said the installments option had not gone through, they refused to take responsibility, told me it was my error, they refused to help and after calling them multiple times one customer service told me he'd elevate the issue and gave me a ticket number. After several weeks they still haven't contacted me. I had to pay the full amount at once even though I wasn't prepared for it in order to avoid having to pay for interest and Amazon never took responsibility.I had to pay the full amount at once for a malfunctioning phone and I truly regret it. If you care about getting the service you deserve, and dealing with responsible sellers/customer service avoid purchasing a phone from Amazon and this seller.",2020年1月28日 在美国审核

Everything I Hoped it Would Be,"I got this phone to replace my cheap, older phone I'd had for a few years that was about to give out. It seriously lacked RAM so it was impossible to have more than 2 apps open at one time without the phone going hot while trying to do something simple, if not outright freeze, crash, and reboot. The battery was also giving out too, so watching movies/video was a no-go if I wanted to have the phone last more than 4-5 hours.The Note 9 was a phone that I've wanted for a little while now, and after finding it for such a steal I decided to go in and get one. Overall, I really can't complain much. The phone came turned off with a charger cable and was pre-wiped and ready to go. I had a little trouble getting the phone to take my SIM card, but it turns out that the phone wasn't the culprit - I needed to contact my service provider and give them the IMEI number for them to switch it over. After that, zero issues. METRO PCS USERS - YOU HAVE TO CALL METRO AND GIVE THEM THE IMEI NUMBER IN ORDER FOR YOUR SIM CARD TO WORK WITH THE PHONE.After activation, it was easy to sync up my account and I've had zero issues with the phone in the month or so I've had it. The screen is bright and really responsive, the biometric features are hit or miss - the Face Unlock really only works in the right light at the right angle, and I've had issues with the fingerprint reader, but I think that has more to do with the case I bought for the phone than the actual reader itself.In the time I've had the phone, there's been no crashes of the phone or any apps. The phone does get a little warm during heavy use, but nothing that I've felt I had to worry about. Charging happens pretty quickly with the cable - I'm planning to get a wireless charger soon - and the battery life is exceptional. Even after watching 3-4 hours of Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, Disney + and Amazon Prime Video, the battery barely took a 15-20% hit. Power Saving settings, if properly utilized, can stretch the battery even more. I work nights and if the phone is fully charged when I leave, then during the 75 minute commute to and from work, heavy use during two 15 minute and a 30 minute break and a few hours beyond that, it's rare that I I make it home every morning with any less than 40-45%.All in all, this was a great purchase and I feel like I'm getting more than my money's worth.",2020年1月24日 在美国审核

Update - April 2020,"I just received my new ""refurbished"" Note 9 and I love it! It did come in mint condition, no scratches or damage to the phone at all. So far playing with the features and setting up have been a piece of cake; pretty similar to my previous Samsung Galaxy 5 so that made it easier to set up. I am awaiting a sim card that I needed to order in order to operate the phone with Straight Talk phone service. But I expect it to be fine.The only thing I wasn't too thrilled with is the new glass design, ""curved edges"". Sometimes when just touching the edge, it takes you somewhere that you didn't want to go to. Other than that it's great. I am appreciative that I was able to get one at a discounted price because I couldn't afford this phone new. So thank you!UPDATE: April 15th, 2020Phone has 2 speakers, one on top of phone and one on bottom. The top speaker keeps shutting off and on, therefore making it very difficult to hear at all times. ALSO, texting photos are taking a really long time to go through. I never had this problem with any of my other phones before. Wrote to seller about getting another one because, other than that, I still love the phone and everything else seems to work fine to date. For now I give it a four star. Will update to a 5 star again if all goes well after hearing and working with seller.",2020年4月4日 在美国审核

Good deal,"I was a bit concerned about buying a ""Renewed"" phone, especially after reading several complaints here about the phone not being truly unlocked, and still bound to a particular cellular service provider. Fortunately, my unit came without any such issues. After three days of digging into software, I couldn't find any info that could help identify the previous service vendor, if there was one. My current provider is Tmobile, and the phone seems to be happy to work on their network without any issues.Speaking of software, the phone came with android 9 ""Pie"" OS preinstalled, as well as the usual Samsung bloatware, but that's it. No vendor-specific apps.The package contained the phone (Snapdragon 845 version), charged to half capacity, a Samsung's charger and a noname USB type C cord. It's the bare minimum sufficient to get the phone up and running. The phone itself shows some evidence of prior usage (for which I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5): the sd/sim card door seems to have been opened at least several times, and there is a couple of microscopic scratches on the back near the fingerprint sensor.Not a deal breaker for sure, just a minor annoyance.Everything the phone is supposed to be doing it is doing with gusto. And yeah, it is still a great device. As a longtime Note user, I can appreciate how much the brand evolved over the years. The upgraded S-Pen is so useful in so many ways, I can't imagine how most people manage to live without it. Maybe Note9 is not as cutting edge as it was a year ago, butit is so well-rounded in terms of features and capabilities that it's hard to find any other phone that's clearly superior to it, even among newer ones.The only thing I really miss is the IR blaster, which was present on some earlier Notes. It seems that all phone manufacturers decided to ditch IR altogether, so I don't really have a choice in this regard.Overall, I am happy with my purchase, especially considering the price.",2019年7月6日 在美国审核

Good but...,"So the device itself seems to be working just fine. When it got here the phone was gross. It had something stuck on it as if someone handed it to a small child with sticky hands then stuck it in the box.It says it comes with a Sim card Key but didn't, no big deal I have extra.It came with a screen protector on which I thought oh hey cool. I'd already ordered new screen protectors and decided to add the new one anyway since this one had a few bubbles. Well it had the screen protector on to cover the pretty decent sized gouge in the screen. Deep enough that when I run my fingernail over it, it catches. So I wasn't happy about that.It was also supposed to be t-mobile phone but when I turned it on it said ATT but a paper said it was unlocked and explained how to reset the phoneso no big deal.Over all I still like this phone I just felt $250 for it's condition was a bit much. Hopefully it continues to work and I don't have any issues with it.",2021年11月5日 在美国审核

Looks and feels BRAND NEW! Came Unlocked and factory restored - Verizon User,"This review should be two fold: one for the Samsung Note 9 and second the quality of the condition of the phone itself from the seller. In the context of it being a used Amazon Renewed Phone, got to say, wow! It has exceeded my expectations on both fronts but most especially the quality of the condition the phone. I haven't detected a single scratch on the screen or edges. Battery life is holding strong - a real improvement from the note 8.Set up was a breeze - just popped my Verizon SIM card from my previous phone (Note 8), signed into google which automatically started downloading all of my apps, media, ect, with all of my custom settings and preferences fully intact, I might add. And bam. Within 30 minutes I was making calls.Now the samsung Note 9. It's an unbelievable phone. A true flag ship - and I couldn't believe it was available at under the $400 price point. I will definitely be doing this from now on - buying 1 year old flag ships on Amazon renewed. It's just an insane bargain for what your getting - one of the best phones ever made, with little to no signs of previous use.5-stars!",2020年3月3日 在美国审核

UPDATED - Almost all aftermarket parts broke within a year,"The phone is what I expected for refurbished. With close examination, I can see one ding around the speakers and four pinprick-sized spots of missing paint on the top and bottom edges. None of these irregularities are noticeable at a distance of a few inches and are completely hidden by the phone case. The stylus had a sticky smudge the size of a baby's pinky nail that cleaned up easily with a micro-fiber cloth and left no permanent marks.The phone itself is an excellent upgrade. I had a Galaxy 7 (not a Note) which worked okay but was dated. I had to install and re-install apps to get them to work correctly, so I upgraded to the Note 9. The battery life is MUCH improved. My old device was dead in less than 8 hours, but the Note 9 has gone 24 hours on a full charge and is only down to 51%.I don't know how much I can add to this review to make it meaningful, but if you were like me and looking to upgrade but is sitting on the fence, go ahead and do it. I saved approximately two hundred dollars by buying refurbished, and my refurbished model is like-new with hard-to-notice scuffs, and it a huge improvement over my old device.UPDATED: 1 Year LaterWithin a year the charging port and the camera failed. I took it into a shop to be repaired, and found that all the part that broke were aftermarket. Now, I knew receiving a phone with aftermarket parts was a possibility, but when they opened the device they found missing screws and clear wear and tear on the internal parts. I like the device and it's functionality, but ultimately I'm paying for repairs that cost 50% of what I actually paid for the device. And, of course, all these issues came up long after the 90-day warranty, but all of it happened within a year.Buyer beware.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核

Best Purchase Dollar for Dollar,"I have Metro PCS and I was very interested in buying a device compatible with my service features such as wi-fi calling and caller ID. Not to mention full capabilities to utilize network connectivity.I ordered two other Samsung devices, both International versions and I had issues with both (A50 and A70). Both stopped receiving text messages after a couple of days. Tech support wasn't able to figure it out, I read all the blogs online and concluded that international versions are not 100% compatible, hence why they're cheaper.Then I found this, I was debating between the OnePlus 7 PRO and the S10+, but I also didn't want to spend too much. Then I found this Tmobile Note 9, OnePlus wasn't a challenger due to the lack of micro sd slot. It is unlocked. It is a Tmobile phone. (Tmobile boot up) Pristine condition. (Zero blemishes) Battery works as it should. (I had this phone before brand new). It doesn't include an original Samsung fast charger. This doesn't bother me as I have plenty.For the price it's hands down the best phone you can get, this is a flag ship device. Waterproof, expandable memory, 4k 60fps quality video, super vivid screen. This phone was $1000 brand new just a few months ago. I can't even tell its used!

"Great buy, performs like new, but minor cosmetic damage","I bought this product about a month and a half ago. So far I am very happy with my purchase. I upgraded to this phone from a Samsung S7 Active. I was very cautious buying a ""Renewed"" smart phone. However, I was pleasantly surprised.But I want to make clear that the quality of the product could vary from seller to seller as it is not directly sold by Amazon but third party sellers who meet Amazon's specifications. My phone was sold by D'tech Mobile, and therefore your experiences my differ depending on your seller as other reviews suggest some are better than others in terms of quality. But keep in mind Amazon offers a decent 90 return/exchange policy.Anyway, as for the phone cosmetics, this is a used product so I wasn't expecting a pristine phone. The phone had a few small dents on the corners indicating it had been dropped from a short height on occasion. The front and back glass were very clean and mostly free of scratches. There were a few very minor scratches near the edges of the screen that were only really visible if the light hit the phone at the right angle. The S-pen was also in good condition but it was obvious that the previous owner heavily used the pen based on the wear on the writing tip. But the pen was still very usable, and any defect was hardly noticeable. With the case and screen protector on, you wouldn't be able to notice any of these minor flaws. I considered dropping to 4 stars because of this, but reconsidered as it is a used product after all and doesn't affect the overall experience of daily use.Now for the performance quality. The battery life was excellent. Part of the reason I upgraded was due to my previous phone's increasingly poor battery life. The battery life on this phone is excellent even used. I get a full day of heavy use, and two to two and a half days with casual use. The screen of the phone is top notch. The phone overall is very responsive. My previous phone had significant lag between inputs and seeing the action on screen. This phone lacks any such delay. The processor is very fast even with daily use though it is almost 2 generations old now. Side note: the phone is very large. I have large hands with long fingers and have issues reaching all corners of the screen with one hand. Keep that in mind if you have less than average sized hands.Also, several other reviews have claimed that their product was not unlocked. My phone was unlocked and worked on my AT&amp;T network. Keep in mind that this is a GSM phone, and therefore only works with GSM carriers (AT&amp;T and T-Mobile). Verizon and Sprint are CDMA carriers, and it seems most of the reviews that claimed in was not unlocked were for these carriers.TL;DR: Great quality for the price. Don't expect a new product, but rather a product that performs like new. Your experience may differ based on seller.",2020年5月21日 在美国审核

"Absolutely great phone, but is still a used phone!","Love my new ""renewed"" Galaxy Note 9 phone, Samsung finally did the Note series right! This phone is fast, has lots of memory,has a large screen, great features and performance,s pen, water resistant,easily expands with up to a 500gb micro sd card.. I've loaded every app I ever wanted into my phones 128 memory and still have 85+ GB. Then I bought a 256gb sd card, (Samsung also),and downloaded another 13gb of Music Cds onto it. Absolutely no lag when scrolling through my CD list. Battery life if also fantastic. So far I've used it all day and all night long and still have 30 to 60 % battery life, at the end of the day.Still not used to the fact that I may not need to bring my charger along with me to work.. The price was great also, but the only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars,is because it is advertised as T mobile GSU, ""renewed"", the phone I received was clearly used, the screen has a few scratches and the back and edges also have scratches and pits. Plus the phone was set to AT&amp;T. I was able to insert my T mobile sim card and T mobile came up fine. The only reference to AT&amp;T was after a restart.The startup symbol appears for a sec and then disappears, with T-mobile logo on top.",2020年1月29日 在美国审核
Fastest phone I have ever used on Verizon prepay [4.5 stars],"Crystal clear phone calls, voice to text is the best on this phone out of any phone I have ever owned in my life.<br><br>Blackberry KeyOne can choke on it! I've run with Blackberry for the last few years, they did a replacement upgrade when my phone was lost at the FedEx or UPS warehouse, and let me keep it as a backup when it was recovered. So service seemed great, but recently I had to roll back bc my replacement phone has been breaking down. I transferred everything to my original KeyOne only to discover they never actually repaired the phone when it was in for repair. Neither of these phones ever did voice to text correctly.Years ago, I had a Samsung Note 3, which I loved. It was a durable, high quality phone, that didn't slip through your hands. Only problem is, when networks moved beyond 3G, it became pretty worthless. If there was an upgrade option for wireless networks in phones, then I probably would not have stopped using it before this year.Unlike the Note 3, the Note 9 is a slippery phone, so you need a solid protective case. I bought a stack of cases with the phone to try out and my favorite is the Zizo Bolt Series with detachable belt hook. - Brilliant design and durable enough that I feel safe using this phone with that case.. I'll be doing a youtube video on the cases in a few weeks.. look for Joseph Pahrle to watch it.Overall, I'm just amazed by how fast this phone pulled all my apps in. It had every app from my old phone loaded before I walked in the door of the grocery store down the street. It was the fastest upgrade I have ever had in a smart phone. Absolutely love this phone!/!\ update.. photos are very good, but video stabilization is very weak. If they added 5-axis image stabilization to this phone, then it would be perfect!</br></br>",2020年6月3日 在美国审核

4g doesn't work but I can make phone calls....,"Excited for something new but I feel I was fooled, I thought I ordered the unlocked version but for reason I failed ..I guess.

But I tried to remain optimistic and go to set up phone and hear the t mobile chime, this was upsetting but again in a negative world I strive for positivity. So I continue thesetup things are looking good I’m feeling good, I make a call it works so no problem I can deal with the bloat ware.

"Phone marked as ""stolen"" in Verizon's database - can't be activated","I purchased the Verizon unlocked version of this phone.They sent me the fully ""factory"" unlocked version of the phone.I thought this wasn't a problem - should be able to swap my sim card.My sim card was the wrong size, so I took the phone to Verizon to get a new sim, and they said they couldn't activate the new phone because it was marked as ""stolen"" in their database.They confirmed that the phone was unlocked and COULD be activated by Verizon if it weren't marked as stolen.I know it's a gamble purchasing refurbished items, but I didn't expect an Amazon certified seller and refurbisher to be selling stolen phones.That's why I shop on Amazon rather than eBay.Good think Amazon backs this with their return policy.I'll be getting a refund.",2020年7月30日 在美国审核

Great Customer Service- please read details!,"Updated! Went from 1 star to 5 star..<br>So the phone was in excellent condition However it could not be activated on T-Mobile due to it was blocked on T-Mobile because it had an outstanding balance due!Apparently whoever had the phone before owes a balance on the actual phone and on their bill. Therefore it could not be activated so after Many many hours of troubleshooting as to why I could not get signal to make/receive any phone calls or text messages found out I was not able to activate it. I'm sure there is a way to know this before the seller is actually selling the phone.I probably should have gone with a seller that had higher ratings but I like to give everybody a chance because you gotta start somewhere however this was a major inconvenience of waiting for the phone, the troubleshooting and only to be let down that it could not be used.It was a Samsung Galaxy note 9 in Lavender 128 GB unlocked T-Mobile phone. I was refunded upon sending back. I took a gamble again, not knowing it was the same company that I ordered from b4. This time instead of ordering an unlocked T-Mobile phone, I ordered a 'T-Mobile' phone- or so I thought.. This one was a Samsung phone (not locked to Any company) which was still having problems with, wouldn't update on T-Mobile system -although once again in excellent condition... I reached out to seller and said that I needed not an 'unlocked' not a 'Samsung' only brand but a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 9 phone. AsSoon as I returned the phone they sent me out or replacement and I have not had any problems since! No balances were due, it was a factory T-Mobile Samsung phone. Updates are working fine along with network.My problem for not being very specific with the seller &amp; my purchase.. I give them a 5 for Customer Service &amp; a excellent condition of all 3 phones that were sent!Hope this review helped :)</br>",2020年2月23日 在美国审核

Unlocked as advertised,"I bought this phone for my younger sister who doesn't live in the United States. The phone functions well, and it is definitely unlocked. She placed her non-American Number in the phone and was able to set up the phone with ease. She only had the phone for 3 weeks so far, but she has no problem with the device.The phone came in great condition, no scratches, and not much notible scuffs. Looks pretty new. The phone is getting 4 stars because it didn't come with an original charging cord, earphones, and some other items that would normally come with the phone. It came with a generic charging cord, original wall plug, the stylist pen, and a metal pin to open the slot for your sim &amp; SD card.The generic cord stop working after the first week. So I recommend buying other accessories for the phone separately.",2020年1月8日 在美国审核
Fantastic New Phone!,My Galaxy S5 finally let me know it was time to retire.I bought this phone after careful consideration and comparison.The one that lost is the S8 Active.It lost only because of its age.This phone is brand new in the box!If it was previously owned it was never used or taken out of the box!This machine is fantastic!The fingerprint reader is a dream.I have 4 finger prints loaded into it - two from each hand so I can unlock with ease or use the pattern to unlock.Speed and memory are leaps ahead of my S5!!I think this is by far the best looking phone I've ever had.WIth an Otter Box Defender (knock off) case and a tempered glass screen protector I'm all set to go.I should have done this sooner!Excellent purchase!,2021年10月20日 在美国审核

Exactly what I wanted!!,"After almost 6 months of trying to figure out exactly what kind of one I wanted and watching YouTube reviews on countless phones,I decided to buy the Samsung note 9 and decided to give a try with buying a phone from amazon. I made sure to read the reviews on countless of the options amazon had for the note 9 and settled on this one, and let me tell you I am not disapointed!!!I am absolutely in love and very pleased with what I received.Despite some reviews claiming the pen and charger were bad quality I think they may have since fixed that issue because my pen and charger are both samsung and work fine. The phone is in perfect condition no scratches and even had a screen protector on it. I took the phone to metro to have my service switched over from my old phone and the guy mentioned it had 2 screen protectors on it? Heck I don't mind either way it was a nice surprise I'm clumsy, lol. The guy even said ""wow this is a really nice phone"". Overall not a single complaint thank you to the seller!!!!

Love my upgrade from Note 3 to Note 9,"I love the quality of this phone, especially considering it was refurbished. It came like brand new, no blemishes I could see. Worked perfectly. I was able to get it set up on a mobile phone plan with no problems at all. It takes some time getting used to the new type of pen and how to get it out (press to pop it out like a button instead of just yanking it out like older models). But i love the screen size, the art apps, and the camera is EXCELLENT quality. I feel like this is a solid phablet hybrid that can help me with any of my creative projects. I use it every day to take pictures, draw, use Adobe mobile applications, take notes, write to do lists and shopping lists, make calls, and watch YouTube. I would highly recommend this phone to any artistic person or anyone who loves previous Galaxy Note phones. I'm not a super technical person so I couldn't offer any comparisons between Galaxy S9, and all the other versions in the newest Galaxy lineup.

"Phone scratched, missing items, seller didn't respond","The phone did not meet Amazon's renewed item standards.It has scratches and mars visible from 12"" away.I am traveling so it's about impossible to exchange it and see if the next one is better, so I'm living with it.Luckily they aren't terrible scratches and I'm not a perfectionist any more.Also, the listing says only the headphones are not included, but the extra pen nibs, nib remover, cover, and usb-c to usb-a connector were not in the box as they should have been.Amazon says all original items are included unless specified in the listing.I wrote the seller about the missing items and received no response.It's not a deal breaker, I'm glad to have the phone. It just out of integrity.Buyer be informed.Also, mine is a Verizon phone. A note in the box said to ignore that and be assured it is unlocked. I ended up with Verizon, so I could not test how easy it was to use another provider.As for the phone, I like the way you can write on the screen without unlocking it. I do this for taking quick notes, especially for dream recall.I am not a fan of the curved edge, it's more trouble than helpful.You can't use a normal screen protector.I still haven't put my fancy $50 curved glass one on because I'm nervous I will do it wrong or it will look horrible.It is a bit slippery and narrow to hold.I like some of the new interface elements but that bixby button is a bit of a pain, getting hit by mistake every day.The battery can last days of you put it in minimal function mode.I had a note 3 before that was having too many problems with GPS and slow speed so I finally gave it up.I'm grateful I was able to get a refurbished upgrade.",2020年2月3日 在美国审核
Its great!,"I love it! The Note 9 is already a great phone, but getting a refurbished one for waaay cheaper made it all the more worth it.

There was only a tiny tiny scuff , but i am not picky, especially since it's on the back and i use a case anyway. Plus, the have a 60 return policy, so if the is something wrong with it it can be returned!",2019年2月21日 在美国审核
Excellent condition and unlocked.,"Buying used (or ""renewed"") phones is always a gamble, but it definitely paid off for me. The phone I received was indeed factory unlocked, and in even better condition than I was expecting. It had a very, very tiny chip on the bottom corner, a few barely visible scratches on the back, and some slight dirt/scratching around the outside of the USB-C port. The S-pen was also in good condition, and the correct color, but the tip (nib) was worn down a bit. A fast charger and cable also came in the box, both in excellent condition. While the phone didn't have anyone's account or info on it, it had already been through the initial setup. The first thing I did was a factory reset, which should ALWAYS be the first thing you do on a new phone.As for the phone itself... I couldn't be happier! After hearing that the new Moto G Stylus wouldn't have NFC, and a decidedly worse pen, I went for the Note 9. It's probably the best phone purchase I've ever made. Even though it's several years old now, it still beats the 2020 Motorola budget phones in performance for just $60 more (used).It has a headphone jack, unlike the Note 10, and I actually prefer having some empty space on the top and bottom of the screen to host the camera and speaker, as opposed to a hole-punch or notch. The battery easily lasts me 2 days at half brightness, at the highest resolution. Speaking of resolution, there are three options: 720p, 1080p, and 1440p. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in battery life between 1080 and 1440, but I also can't see any real difference in quality between the two. Both options look fantastic. The screen can get incredibly dim, and also incredibly bright. There are two speakers, one on each side of the phone. They sound good, however, only the top speaker is on the front of the phone (facing you), while the other is on the bottom (next to charging port) and can be muffled by your hand while holding the phone sideways. Tons of storage space, plus expandable storage if you have an SD card to spare. NFC (Google pay/Samsung pay) is supported, unlike most similarly priced budget phones. Wireless charging is nice and allows charging even if the USB-C port fails or breaks later on. The fingerprint scanner is quick and works great.The 12-megapixel camera is the biggest negative for this phone in 2020. Good enough for day to day use and even vacation photos, but the real draw (ha) is the pen, not the camera. Secondly, the battery can't be replaced without removing the entire front panel of the phone, which is made intentionally difficult. Not uncommon these days, but a negative nonetheless.The pre-installed Samsung apps aren't too intrusive, and I replace most of them with Google alternatives. The same can't be said for Bixby or the Bixby home. Luckily, you can disable the Bixby home screen, and you can now re-bind the Bixby button to open a different app, or open nothing at all! Facebook can't be uninstalled, but you can ""disable"" it, which is good enough.The S-pen is incredible. I didn't realize just how versatile the pen was before I purchased it, but I'm so glad I did. It has pressure sensitivity, a tiny button on one side of the pen, and even tilt detection! It's an active pen, so it communicates it's position and angle to the phone when held close to the screen, showing a dot or text cursor depending on the context. It can be set to disable finger presses when detected, so you can safely place your hand on the screen while drawing without causing issues! It essentially IS a drawing tablet, albeit quite small. It is far superior to a capacitive pen, like what the Moto G Stylus has, which doesn't have any of these features. The main downside is that the pen has a capacitor that needs to be charged. It's not a huge issue as it can be fully charged in 40 seconds (by simply inserting it into the phone), and lasts 15-30 minutes per charge. - Worth noting, mine did NOT come with extra pen tips (nibs), and the only way to get official replacements is to buy a new pen from Samsung (on Amazon) for $30. (Pen purchase comes with 1 additional soft tip and 1 additional hard tip). Or, you can go for a possibly less-than-quality Chinese replacement set for ~$5. If you are using a screen protector, the cheap ones should be fine.- Some sellers may be better than others. My phone came from CellGuru and they get a +1 from me.- I highly recommend a case and screen protector, as both sides of this phone are covered in glass. I also specifically recommend a glass screen protector instead of film/plastic. My film protector added lots of resistance when using the S-pen, to the point of being unusable for drawing.",2020年2月17日 在美国审核

Great phone at a great price,"Phone arrived promptly in absolutely perfect condition. Not a scratch or a blemish of any kind. Only minor quibble was that it only came with a sim card tray removal tool. No charger or charging cord. Not a big deal as we have a bunch of them anyway. Brought it to our Verizon store and they popped in a sim card and it was up and running perfectly. Used Samsung Smart Switch to move over everything from the old phone to the new one. So my wife now has all of her text threads, photos, settings, passwords and apps. Couldn't be any happier. Battery life is ridiculously great and the screen is bright and clear.Edit: my wife was about to throw out the box it came in and guess what? There was the charger and USB-C cord! It's a cheap aftermarket charger that doesn't do fast charge, but they did provide a charger. So this has been a perfect purchase. Couldn't be happier. Kudos to Amazon.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核
Quality will change depending on what seller you buy from and how lucky you are.,"Quality and choice of service provider vary greatly depending on the seller but all of them are pretty similar. Look for sellers who have at least a few thousand reviews and are above 85 percent positive for your best chance at a great phone with your choice of service provider. I got lucky and ordered a Verizon but got an unlocked, so it's really all just a chance thing. Also if you get the wrong phone, or a broken one, you can just ship it back and get a full refund within 3 days.",2020年10月11日 在美国审核

"Phone Arrived Clean, Nearly Perfect, Activated on Verizon Wireless Without Issue","I've been using this ""renewed"" Samsung Galaxy Note9 for a little over one month.It has worked without any problems and activated on Verizon wireless using the SIM card from my old VZW phone without any issues.I never had to contact VZW, it just worked the way it should once I put in the SIM card.The only criticism I have is that there is a clearly observable scratch on the right side of the screen close to the edge bend near the middle.The scratch is about 3/16"" long and is definitely visible from more than 12-inches away and therefore I don't think the phone was properly classified by the vendor as to condition.There is also a small scratch on the bottom of the phone, but this is minimal and I think it's within the grading classification given to the phone.So, all told I'm happy with the phone and I think I'd buy it again.A previous Note9 I purchased through another vendor went straight back for a refund when it arrived with a facacta power button that was incredibly soft and would clearly fail in short order.",2020年3月29日 在美国审核

But it should work just fine. My friend has this phone and I already know that it's quite fantastic if I have any issues all update my review.

Mostly great phone,"I bought a used Galaxy Note 9 from Celltraders. When I buy used, I always research the seller. You should always do that, ofc, but especially for used tech. As it turns out, I got a great phone but with one detail that's not as bad for me as it may be for others.First off, it was listed as locked to AT&amp;T, so I got exactly what I expected.My Note 9 was almost perfect. I mostly use my phone for gaming, videos, texting, and social media. All of that was awesome. Gorgeous details and screen. Great pics. Good sound out of the speakers. Lots of space because I got the 512gb version. Oddly enough, I rarely use it as an actual phone, which is why it took me a few days to realize the sound was a little tinny.To the person I'm talking to, everything sounds fine. But what I hear is off. It's not soft and it doesn't effect my ability to understand what's being said, but I've heard regular Galaxy 9s and it's not the same. That being said, it did take me a few days to actually use it as a phone and by that time, I'd set up everything the way I wanted. So I kept it and I have no regrets.Had I noticed the issue as soon as I got the phone, I may have tried to return it. But with the price a paid I'm happy.",2021年3月4日 在美国审核

High Quality Complicated Flagship,"Several years ago I bought a Galaxy Note 3. Great phone, never had a problem. Used it for several years. Everyone at work had an iPhone and since I work in IT, I thought I should get an iPhone so I would know how to use it. So I reluctantly shut down my Note3 and picked up an iPhone 6s. I really liked it but it was kind of small and somewhat limited- really nice phone overall though. What I liked most about the iPhone (besides the really slick GUI and the lightning cable) was that it was equipped with an NFC. I found I could use it to pay for just about everything. After a while though I grew tired of the whole iTunes thing and my eye began wandering. It landed on a MotoG7 which is really nice for a mid range phone. Runs crisply and reliably and has a lot of MOTO features that give it a very user friendly vanilla Android 9.0 experience. As of late, with the CoVid -19 onslaught, I began not really wanting to use my debit card and enter a PIN on some PIN pad at every store I went to. So I again went looking for a phone that had NFC, a good size with a vivid screen, and wireless charging. Samsung wants premium prices for their flagship phones so I looked for a phone with the features I wanted for the least amount of money. The Note9 fits the bill perfectly! I run my phones on the Ting network so I called them and they sent me a SIM immediately. I ordered this Renewed GSM Note9 and am thrilled with it. It ticks all the boxes and then some. It runs really well and has a very vivid display. The camera takes clear and brilliant pics. And... it has the NFC!! There is quite a learning curve with this phone. Samsung's OneUI overlay gives incredible flexibility, but it feels like it's trying to do too many things, too many notifications, too many reminders. But again, all of those things can be turned off and adjusted as needed. I ordered the phone on a Saturday and it arrived by Tuesday! This is significant since Amazon has been slammed by the pandemic and was showing a 3-4 week delivery window. Overall, great price, fast delivery, fantastic phone (literally looks and runs like new!!). It's good to have a Note in the stable again.",2020年4月9日 在美国审核

Beware of the Microphone,"I love everything about this phone except the fact that the microphone doesn't work.Everything else about the phone is fantastic, but if you want to talk on the phone, record sound, use text to speak features or anything of that nature, the microphone is so low you won't be able to.These features work fine if you have a headset or if you're using Bluetooth for phone calls, but it's irritating.Evidently, this is something that is a particular issue with a number of Galaxy Note 9 phones, so be aware of this before you purchase it. If it wasn't such a pain to go back through the process of getting a new phone, I would have returned it and found another one.As it is, it's manageable if you carry a headset everywhere you go.It's also such a large phone that you really need something to carry it in.Since the front and back are reportedly made of glass, please make sure you get a reliable case.Even with the case I purchased, I'm still looking for a clutch to carry the phone, as I previously had a purse/wallet that held my former Galaxy.I am sure I'll find something soon!",2019年11月8日 在美国审核

"Excellent phone bought through OCrack, no drama","I love my new (to me) phone! It's been a while since I bought my previous used phone, and some of the reviews had me a bit scared when I was looking through the Note9 listing. I bought my phone through the seller O'Crack and it's worked out. Arrived when they said it would. I was a little confused when I turned it on and a Tmobile logo came up, but the seller quickly responded to my email to let me know that it was unlocked, they just tested it with the networks before sending the phone out. Once I put in the sim card it was good to go and no issues with the transfer. Phone is in excellent condition, with no flaws that I can notice. Again I recommend this seller. And whether your experience is good or bad, make sure to state which seller you bought from in your reviews because it seems like reviews for different sellers were clumped together in this product page so some people had wildly different experiences depending on which seller they got.",2020年8月12日 在美国审核

Sprint is NOT T-Mobile when it comes to LOCKED phones!!,"Looks like a good phone to replace my aging Galaxy 11 that has problems processing stuff as of late. Ordered the T-Mobile compatible Samsung Note 9, specifically as a T-Mobile compatible service phone. Phone arrived within a week, so no problems there. Charged it up, and then turned on power to see the screen options. When it did boot up to the home screen, and I saw a Sprint Icon, I knew there was a problem.Although T-Mobile and Sprint are now 1, their phones are not. What was once a propriety Sprint cell phone, is still a Sprint Locked phone, and cannot be unlocked by T-Mobile. Taking it to my local T-Mobile store for help, and having a new SIM card inserted (as mine from my older phone did not work in the new Sprint phone), and trying again, did not help. Showed them my Amazon order, and the shipping box, both showed I ordered a T-Mobile compatible phone, but that was not the case. If you are selling something as a T-Mobile compatible product, you better make sure it is what you are selling it as, and not another brand. That is false advertising, or stupidity, on the sellers behalf.",2021年9月12日 在美国审核

Just like new,"Item came well-packed and in perfect condition. Even the protective plastic was still present on the edges and camera. I am not sure if this phone was ever used. Just as promised, the phone is carrier-free and unlocked. Not a mark or fingerprint on it.Everything is in perfect working order; the mic, camera, speaker.Do note: It only comes with the phone &amp; pen, a charging cord, charging block, and sim tool. Not the headphones, pen tips or other accessories that are bundled with a new phone. If you need those items, you may be just as well to buy new. If not, save yourself some money.I use T-Mobile. The phone recognized my SIM card and registered on the network instantly. I did not have to go through any extra hoops to connect to LTE+ or use my WiFi calling. I didn't even have to contact customer service to make sure the phone was properly recognized. Phew! The Android Pie update just got pushed to the Note 9 and it makes the phone feel even slicker.As for the phone: I am blown away by the battery life and UI improvements over my previous Note 5. I am not a heavy gamer but I do put a lot of strain on the phone with research, camera use, and design programs. The phone is large for my small hands, but there are a lot of ways to control the phone with one hand and voice. I am smitten with the remote control pen. I can get shake-free pics of my art and tiny things. The fingerprint recognition is hugely improved over the Note 5, it works every time, whether my hands are cold or have been in the water. The UI has added a lot of features I normally use 3rd party apps to change; such as an overall dark theme and improved Samsung keyboard. I highly recommend buying the app ""bxActions"" Button Remapper to remap the Bixby button to be more useful.I had an issue with the phone's charging block and the seller got back to me within hours to say they are shipping me a replacement. If you have any kind of issue this seller is fast, friendly, and happy to work with you. Would recommend!",2019年3月22日 在美国审核

Great phone,"The phone I ordered arrived in mint condition, not a scratch ding or scuff. It had an original Samsung fast charger. Works perfectly.

During the initial setup it asks for the SIM card,after completing it will still show as a N960U1 (T-Mobile is N960U) and will not have the T-Mobile software. However the VOLTE and WI-FI calling all still work on the T-Mobile network with a T-Mobile SIM. Overall very happy with the phone especially the battery life which is excellent.

"Great refurbished phone, ordered from re-cell","To start off, the Samsung galaxy note 9 is a massive upgrade from the Samsung galaxy note 3 that I had before which started dying of natural causes.A few things to note, this is my first refurbished phone, and as of writing this review I have had this phone for about a month.Upon opening the box I did an initial scan of the camera, screen and casing. The camera worked fine and didn’t have any scratches or issues. The screen did not have any scratches or blemishes and had a mirror like finish from a very lightly used or heavy duty screen protector. There were no cracks or defects anywhere except for the lower left corner, like it was dropped from a low height onto a jagged surface like side walk concrete; and the s pen was in used condition. Other than those two defects I could have sworn this phone was brand new never before used (based on appearance)The box from re-cell came with a charging cord, a well-used usb outlet plug (not an issue as it is now my new travel charger where it will get scratched up anyways), headphones with a mic (don’t know the quality as I haven’t used them, it’s just a plus to have them included.The packaging was really stylish it was a satin black with a shiny logo for re-cell. Inside everything was tightly packed to prevent movement when shipping and a note with an email to contact if there were any issues. There were none but it was nice to have the option.A month later after getting used to a new phone I can say there are no issues, it was a risk in my mind to buy a refurbished and based on a lot of review it is a risk. But I will say re-cell was a pleasure to buy from.",2020年2月26日 在美国审核

Great but NOT PERFECT,"Considering the price point for a brand new Note 9 is near a grand from nearly any retailer this is a steal!My experience so far has been a good one, Note 9 came UNLOCKED in a UNMARKED box that contained the phone, an official samsung wall adapter and cable.My gripes are that the cable that came with it broke when I used it only ONCE, yeah ONCE. So I want to warn anyone buying this to be careful with the provided cable.Thankfully the phone came with no scratches or any visible damage! The only downside being that the screen is burned in only slightly from whoever the previous owner was or Amazon charging it and leaving the display on (can only be noticed with shades of gray and not any other color).Other than that, the phone runs great!",2019年12月11日 在美国审核
"Great phone, a few surprises, but a good unit for me personally!","This is a south korean telecom phone that's unlocked, and capable of working on my Mint network just fine!This was a surprise, but after some app disabling, as well as some tweaking of the UI, I think this will be good for me in the long run.This phone has an OEM UNLOCK toggle, so I think I'll be able to flash this phone with custom Android 11 &amp;12 builds someday down the road.One other minor complaint: it came with the grey spen, not the yellow one that comes with this color phone model.That's ok, though- I'll probably buy a new one someday, and that's an awfully minor thing to complain about.Phone works great!

"Practically mint condition, unlocked, and works flawlessly!","I got my renewed Note 9 specifically from the seller ReFoned. The phone is basically brand-new, I can't find a single blemish, the battery is great, and it has the original (bluetooth) S-Pen. I was confused about whether or not it was actually GSM unlocked, explained below.As for the Note 9, I'm really glad I picked this phone. Upgrading from a Moto G3, this was quite an improvement. I'm also really satisfied by the S-Pen, I find myself using the phone significantly more often and for heavier-duty tasks, in part because I hate touch screens (oily hands all over the *screen*? insanity) but the pen means I never have to touch it. Plus, I find myself using it to draw pretty often, since the pressure sensitivity is pretty good even through a film screen protector. Two great bonuses about the Note 9 compared to newer models: No notch or holepunch in the screen for the camera, and it has a headphone jack.The rest of the review is informative, in case you (like me) are confused by whether the phone is unlocked or not:When I first put in my SIM card (from an AT&amp;T reseller), I got the notification ""SIM card is not from Verizon Wireless"", and it came pre-installed with Verizon bloatware, despite me specifically choosing the ""GSM Carriers"" version of the phone.However, all I had to do to get my SIM card to work was go into [Settings &gt; Connections &gt; Mobile networks &gt; Access Point Names &gt; Add], and then fill out the APN according to my carrier's information (just Google your carrier + APN to get the info for yours). Now it works fine with 4G LTE, calling, and texting, and I disabled all of the Verizon apps.The phone is absolutely flawless now. I was worried before purchasing, but I picked out a seller that looked promising and replied to clear up negative reviews on their page, and I'm glad I did. I'm seriously impressed by how great the condition is, for way cheaper than buying new and much safer than buying used elsewhere.",2021年8月25日 在美国审核
Quality...ish.,"The phone has had no problems at all yet, but the problem I have is the inside of the camera glass is dirty. That's not something you can simply wipe away, I'd have to pay money or return it to get it cleaned. It's fairly annoying, it's not a small amount &amp; it's under both cameras. There's also a substance under the heart reader thing that looks like.. dried milk? but it doesn't seem to effect the camera quality &amp; I don't have the time or money to be able to drop ~$70 to get it replaced, so it'll just have to exist like that for now. Having a good amount of dust inside the camera glass could potentially make the camera inoperable if it tried to focus on the dust or obscured vision.

Not original S Pen,The phone came quickly and the overall look was fantastic. After working with the phone I noticed the S pen was not working for air commands. I let the seller D'Tech Mobile know of the issue. They replied with a canned response about reconditioned phones. The S pen is an integral part of the phone unlike a charger or cable. Without a solution the phone will be returned. There are a ton of resellers that satisfy their customers.*Update* The company reached out to me and presented a solution to the issue. I am still waiting on the promised credit; I am adjusting my star rating.,2020年12月11日 在美国审核

Perfect,"Ok realistic review. Quality 10. Battery life 8. Storage 10. Speed 10. Shipping 10. Accessories 10. Speakers 9. Start up 10. Oke everything about this phone is pretty well awesome. I gave battery an 8. I am on my phone none stop all day for work. It lasts about 10-12 hours from full to dead. That's with music streaming about 6 hours onto of my normal activity. Came with all name brand power cord and headphones. Pin works great. Camera is phenomenal. Hard drive was actually the 500gb not the 128gb that I ordered. No complaints!

Only a single microscratch on the screen, the pen works great, some of the paint is chipped on the side (covered by the case anyways). I upgraded from my good ol' S7Edgefrom 2015, so this is a massive improvement. As specified in the product's description, the charging cord is just a cheap replacement, but who cares.

The other complaint is the back glass, which has cracked twice now since I've owned it a little over a month, with no dropping of the phone whatsoever. I don't know if it was a faulty glass from the factory, or if the Otterbox I had on the phone was causing some sort of pressure related stress on the back, but now that I've switched cases I don't have any new cracks to report.

The no compromises device.,"All in all, it's a great device. Compared to some of the newer phones and newer technologies that are out there you'll have slightly slower responses.

But if you're looking for a phone that does it all and doesn't break your bank this is the one for you. It's got all of the features that you could ever want in a phone. Software/hardware wise, if you want to do it this phone probably has a way to make it happen.

I love buying renewed phones.,"Whenever I buy a used product, I always expect some kind of defect that would justify the price I'm paying for it. This is the third used phone I've bought over the past four years and this phone was the best of them all. The phone looks new and was unlocked with no carrier branding or bloatware. The slight discoloration around the camera rim is the only sign that the phone was pre owned. Everything else is perfect on the phone.

DON'T BE PICKY ABOUT THE PHONE,I bought my phone from GSM PROS cus I am sure amazon mixes reviews. The only thing my phone had a scratch on the screen but i put a glass protector on. now its like new and yes it did have pre-loaded app from AT&amp;T but disable them and they disappear. Look if you going to buy used phone for sometimes $300 less then brand new and complain about apps just save for a brand new phone. Also for me it did not come with the original charger or box with accessories. I had an S8 before this so i didn't care they come with the same crap. Although if you really want that stuff go to Mecari or something. they have the original box and all accessories for like $20. So basically just make sure it has any actual S-pen mine did come with one. Also check the IEM number to make sure it a real brand not some knock off one but if AT&amp;T is on it that says something already. Finally just test it with like the service you use and test it with others to make sure if you ever change service it will work there too.,2019年12月25日 在美国审核

Works great, I only gave four stars because the speaker on my phone is busted it's works but you can hear it's muffled. This would be a big deal for a lot of people but I use the fake air pods ( which are pretty good too) and my phone is always on vibrate anyways.So all in all I am very happy with my purchase, and am glad I did not get ripped off.

Read the Description.,"Galaxy note 9 Ocean Blue,Purchased from Wireless Experts, Inc.The product is true, everything works fine.My intentions were to use the phone with sprint, when it arrived, it was originally through T-Mobile (no big deal) upon further research the device is GSM Network only and for those who know Sprint &amp; Verizon use CDMA networks,Therefore I cannot use this device with sprint. Only with GSM Service providers (ex: T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, etc..)BEFORE BUYING:Learn what NETWORK works for your service provider (GSM or CDMA) and read the sellers description on the device carefully. If your still skeptical, contact the seller and test before delivery.IF YOU ALREADY PURCHASED:a quick google search“How to check CDMA or GSM” will verify what networks you can use. Test before returning.Conclusion:Don’t rush your purchase, this is Amazon third party territory.

Camera is insultingly good,"I love the speed. Compared to my Galaxy S7 this is a dream. The screen size is big but doesn't feel ""too big"".

Really crisp images, can't wait to play around with editing pictures again. Which is the reason I got the phone in the first place. The built in s-pen is better than any stylus you could buy for a phone. This one came with a clearly used too, but that's not a deal breaker. There were also a few very small and barely noticable nicks on the back of the phone under the back plate. Also not a deal breaker. Given the price, and that this is an unlocked phone, meaning no TMobile bloatware, this phone is 10/10. I didn't give a full 5 stars because while the batter is much better than my last phone, it's still not impressively good. Face recognition took maybe 5 attempts to recognize me to register my face.

Once my refund showed, I purchased this one that was VERIZON notated in the Listing, and it was unlocked. I had no issues setting it up with Verizon.I bought this phone because I was looking for an upgraded Note phone--mine was failing fast--and I chose this one.CONS:What I didn't notice in time of the (Limited refurb warranty) was that I can NOT get my images off my phone using the cord. I have turned off the preset features, tried all the recommended suggestions and it's not working. I am sincerely disappointed in that because I do take a lot of pictures and I will have to email them to myself until I can get a cloud backup (not using google) to transfer them to my computer. THAT SUCKS...The other thing I'm NOT happy about is when I use the phone on speaker. It is causing problems on the other end of the line and people can't hear me or it has bad reverb. So I have to use a bluetooth headset to make it work.IT leads me to believe this is probably what was wrong with THIS phone when it was refurbished and that refurb techs didn't fix that OR it's not fixable.PROS: it takes really nice pictures, and the rest of the phone works as it should.

Love it,So i have had this phone for over a year. I alwasy buy my phones full price because its cheaper and I can own it and do what I want with it. I cracked the screen after a month but got it fixed. The operating system is fast and nice. It comes with a lot of internal memory but I also put my SD card in it.

Worked for the 90 day trial and then quit,"This phone has been nothing but trouble since the 90 day return period ended. I have tried with two different carriers with the result that calling and texting are spotty to non existent depending on location. The company that refurbished it shipped it with a broken stylus that was taped together with clear tape. The email that I sent to them went unanswered. It's a real shame because I like the phone and the features it has, but just have not been able to make it work as advertised.

"As described!  Unlocked, in great shape.  Recommended item","Phone arrived well packaged with a USB c cable and fast charger.Completely unlocked and bored up just as it should.There were only a couple very minor flaws that would not show when using a case (as I am).The battery life seems decent enough but obviously it wasn't replaced which is somewhat disappointing considering the cost of this item compared with other used note 9's.There was a pre-installed screen protector though which was quite a nice surprise.Overall I'd give it a 4.5/5, only holding back 1/2 star for the somewhat unimpressive battery life.I would definitely recommend this seller.This is my first time buying a used or refurbished phone and if this is the norm I would certainly do it again!",2020年5月10日 在美国审核

WOW - Amazon Refurb is the way to go!  Just 1 small gripe (charger cable),"I was a little sketched out buying a used phone but figured it was worth a shot since Amazon warrantees your purchase for 90 days AND they're guaranteed to look like new.All I can say is WOW - mine very much did look brand new and I absolutely cannot tell it apart from a factory sealed phone fresh out of the box.In fact, still had the plastic on the front screen and bezels - maybe this is something this particular seller provides but I was surprised... nice touch.It was factory unlocked as promised.All I needed to do was install my VZW SIM and a spare 128GB micro-SD I had lying around and power it on.It was connected, up and running in under 5 minutes.Battery is 95% healthy according to the Ampere app, stylus works perfect and I couldn't be happier minus one caveat - the charger.It's clearly called out in the listing that 'it may not include the original charger' but the charger I received does not really work.It doesn't fast charge at all - mainly because the USB-USBC cable is junk.The wall plug itself is ok (Qualcomm PD 3.0) but the cable sucks and also does not carry data (tested on multiple devices).I ended up buying a set of USBC fast charger cables + a wireless fast charger w/next day shipping, so it wasn't a big deal... but my gripe is that the listing says accessories are 'fully functional'.Oh well - minus one star on that but the PHONE ITSELF and the Refurb program both get a full 5.",2020年11月11日 在美国审核

"Great Device, with two minus","So purchased this phone on 8/21/2020,Its a great upgrade from my S8+, better battery, camera, ram, processes, and already upgraded to android 10 and Samsung UI 2.0 right out of the box, and soon UI 2.5 when released ""Showing that Samsung will support the Note 9 and the S9 and 9+ for those that are wondering for one more upgrade.The one came with everything that was mention acharging cable and brick and a preinstalled screen protector.Cosmetically the phone back and front glass looks brand new, but the side aluminum railing looks worn especially near the charge port and one corner which made me think that maybe phone was dropped at one point previously ""Reason i am giving it a 4 starts a little worn in those charge ports and i would give a 5 but it has significant paint missing near the charge port""Phone was a UNLOCKED model which many people complained about, which a lot of people complained they did not receive make sure you choose fully unlocked not GSM, or any of the carrier and you wont have that issue that many gave a bad review on.i do wish that it did come with the needle extractor for the note pin ""because that is i believe an important feature to have ""another reason i gave it a 4 stars"" now it not coming with any headphones i am ok with because refurbished headphones sounds bad lol.Butall in all i do think its worth the 350-400$ price tag. i mean it is a refurbished phone through amazon after all. If you want refurbished that looks brand new and gets everything go to Samsung web page and pay the extra 120$ if you want, but for most people this is a good price to quality for what you are getting..i would recommend getting this but remember the cons i gave which is the aluminum rails can look worn like mine where the paint is missing ""mine is near the charge port and one of the corners and you do not get the Samsung extraction tool for the pin to remove the tip."" Other then that its a great phone to get in my opinion, those two minus are the reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5.",2020年8月24日 在美国审核

Very happy customer,This phone is awesome! I love it. One tiny scratch on corner can only be seen if looking hard.I have it in a case anyway.

Overall OK,"Phone works fine. Screen had no scratches and arrived with a tempered glass screen protector on (thankfully because I dropped it the first day while waiting on my case and amazingly finally got to witness one doing what its supposed to and only cracked the screen protector and not the phone!) Shipping was almost three whole business days later than tracking was claiming it would be the entire time up until it showed up.Came missing the s pen which was disappointing,didn't get it until a full week later, but it was a brand new Samsung packaged s pen with the accessories which I was pleased with since those are like $60. there were major scratches that chipped all the paint off around the charging port, idk how or why they did that but I was worried whoever used to have this phone was really aggressive with their usage/care and it'd effect the functionality but other than that cosmetic flaw there's nothing wrong with the phone that I've noticed.. all the built in battery health tests pass very well.. says it had 90% of its battery capacity upon first scan. I still feel like for refurbished i paid too much for a used phone that originally was sent to me half missing and seemingly uninterested customer service but it is what it is. Im satisfied overall, I paid just under $300 after tax &amp; it was free to switch it to my active metropcs service in one phone call, also has no boatyard which I've never actually had on a phone before I love that part!If you're considering a refurbished phone at all might as well try it and save a few hundred bucks this way bc Amazon will at least make it better if its not what you were expecting",2021年7月9日 在美国审核

Fake S-Pen,"Got the phone. It works really well, very responsive. I'm happy with my upgrade so far. However, it did not ship with a real S-pen.

"Great Screen, UI is smooth, bad battery life","I love Samsung products, but somehow, they missed the mark on battery life with this phone.

YouTube, texting, Facebook messenger, Pandora are all things I run regularly on this phone. Battery life on the Moto Power, blows all other phones I have ever had out of the water.The phone is complicated. There are soooo many options that I think a user would not need. There are menus upon menus in the setting screens...It's almost like Boot Menu on a Windows PC. Lots of stuff in here most users do not know anything about, myself included.

However this has nothing to do with the seller or the specific device seems it is common on most Samsung's in this model range.I am a very tech savvy person (I work in the cell phone industry). I could not disable the ads with any built in settings and it was doing it before I installed any 3rd party apps. It was super disruptive.

Bixby Fail,"Rating is for the phone itself, not the condition. The condition was ""like new"" and I was very happy with that.I even got the OEM charger included in my box.The biggest problem? The most frustrating thing I have every experienced with a phone? Especially on a phone that costs this much?The Bixby button.The physical button on the side, in the middle. Right where your hand naturally holds the phone so you will CONSTANTLY hit it by mistake.After you hit it by mistake Bixby will take over and what you were doing is gone, poof.So normally if you hit the volume key by mistake (which is less likely since it's higher) then no big deal if your volume goes up or down 2 percent from one wrong tap.Hit the Bixby button by mistake and it opens itself full screen and no matter what you were in the middle of is taken away.Samsung will not let you uninstall Bixby. They won't let you disable it. They only (recently) give you the option of assigning the button to another app, but not an option that just does nothing if you push.And if you double tap (thinking you are changing the volume) it will STILL open Bixby full screen regardless of what you remapped to.Since I can't set it to do nothing - whatever app you remapped to takes over and the screen you were on is gone.I've got to where I don't ever do anything in landscape mode because I know as soon as I rotate the phone in my hand I'm going to touch it by mistake.Bixby is no where near as good as Google or Alexa, can't do all the things G or A can do, but they try to force you to use it. Google or Alexa is not forced on you. You don't want it? Don't install/remove widget/tell it to stop listening for wake up. If your stuff is good people will want to use it, should not be shoved down our throat.Some of my other complaints I think are Android Pie's fault so I won't mention those.The camera software I hate, it's constantly changing the brightness even though the lights in the room I'm in are staying the same. Also if I override the software and brighten it up - the brightness will default itself back to normal if you tap the screen where you want it to focus.So the physical camera may be better than was in my old Note 4, the software makes it aggravating, even the editing software for pictures is worse than my Note 4, but this costs double what my Note 4 did.The speaker on bottom instead of on back or front firing means it gets muffled if you hold in on your chest in bed or place it on a charging stand.The headphone jack on the bottom means I have to hold phone upside down so the jack doesn't get in the way/bent over.Good things? It is fast, responsive, battery life is good (so long as you are not playing a game). Charges fast. Brightness is good.I saw in the news the new Galaxy Fold for $2000 also has a Bixby button. So they haven't learned yet and this will be my last Samsung Phone. I've had only Samsung since the flip phone days.You pay this much for a phone it would be nice if you get to decide how you want to use it and what apps you want to use.",2019年4月18日 在美国审核

I fully understand there may be some quirks ordering refurbed items, and I'm glad they were so quick to take the rma for the DOA os.

It’s ok,"The phone works perfectly fine. However the phone has ALOT of dents and scratches on it, it’s missing the paint on the back of the phone and side in areas. There’s a few deep scratches on the screen",2020年5月23日 在美国审核
"Good for the price point, wish it was less scratched","Have been using it for 2 days and so far I'm happy with it. The box was generic but I got the Samsung fast charger in it, so that's a win based on some other reviews, and the sim card tool. Works for tmobile, no issues. Battery so far is great, no glitches *knocks on wood*. There were some noticeable scratches here and there but nothing major (a case covers them) except the back camera has a big scratch (nevertheless it doesn't seem to interfere with the camera so far.)I'll update if things go south. Came with a 90 day warranty (the box included a warranty paper with the vendors info.)",2019年11月3日 在美国审核
"Electronics are great, hardware is worn","The phone itself functions perfectly. Battery is long lasting and charges well. Arrives in out-of-the-factory settings to set up like new.

Check the Camera,"First phone had a thick scratch on one corner. I didn't want to chance that it was defective and I'd be blamed for a drop, so I sent it back. The replacement phone looked fine, but the camera was defective: fuzzy pictures; could not scan/read receipt/product bar codes, QR codes, or checks for deposit through apps. A couple of days after setup, I tried to use it for a mobile bank deposit - scan in check front and back using camera. Camera took blurry photos. Had to use my S7 Edge, no problem.A few days later I was trying to scan in a bar code through a merchant app that I've used many times. Again, fuzzy view, but this time the scanner didn't work at all. Could not read the bar code. Tried QR Code, no luck. The scanning line kept going up and down not detecting the code.Called Amazon and rep tried but could not fix problem. Amazon transferred me to Samsung support. Samsung rep could not find a solution either and determined the camera was probably broken or there was a settings error. She told me the phone was still under warranty. She didn’t check the IMEI or whatever its called, so I doubted that as this was refurbished, although sold as having a US warranty. But hey, I thought I'd give it a try. She gave me a ticket # to take it to [authorized repair shop] for a free fix or trouble shooting in person. Since I could not exchange it for a replacement with Amazon (only 1 replacement allowed), I decided I’d return it.The next day, I decided to check in with the repair shop to see if I might change my mind, depending on what the tech found since I was still hoping this might be a setting problem and pilot error. Taking that full body case on and off alone was enough to make me briefly consider keeping the darn thing.The [authorized repair shop] rep checked my phone settings and the camera, and determined the camera was broken. They had the replacement part. She checked the phone code with Samsung and said the phone was just out of warranty, but that she could apply for an Extended Warranty and Samsung was pretty good at accepting that. No charge to me. I debated but decided that other things might also be wrong.So, thumbs up to Samsung and the [authorized repair shop]. Thumbs down to seller that tried to pass off a phone with a broken camera. Maybe they didn’t check the camera beyond basic photo taking, but they should have and that alone should have alerted them to a problem.Love the phone, so I bought a new one from Amazon to avoid any ""renewed"" issues and get a real warranty. More than I wanted to pay, but good for a new Note 9. At least I hope it was new!",2020年2月26日 在美国审核

Update:  Open the box phone won't work,Update:I purchased a new charger cable and Box. This allowed the phone to charge. The ones that were included with the phone when purchased were terrible. They were the reason why the phone would not charge and I was getting a water in the phone error message. After spending that amount of money I had to turn around and spend another $20 to buy a good charger and cable. That's the sellers problem. The phone is probably the best phone I've owned to date. It's got a lot of great features the camera is great and it's user friendly. The phone gets 5 stars but I would have to say the seller gets one star got putting junk in the package.Open the package. Very generic and cheap charger. Plugged in the phone and received an immediate error that the phone won't charge. Turned on the phone like the back-end same error phone won't charge.

"Works fine, but piece of junk cable and not what I would call 'like new condition'","The phone itself works just fine. I personally have had no issues getting this phone to work with my service provider as I use T-Mobile as a service provider and the phone itself was previously locked to T-Mobile.I think potential buyers should note, however, that the product description CLEARLY states that the phone will not work on Sprint, Verizon, Boost, Virgin Mobile or any other CDMA network, so a lot of these negative reviews are from people who didn't take the time to read the product specs.The two issues that I had with this phone were that cosmetically it's advertised as being in near perfect condition and mine had a few major gauges on it. It looks like the previous owner did not use a case or screen protector at all, to be honest.The other issue was that while I understood that I would not be receiving any manuals or original packaging, it was supposed to come with a certified cable, which was definitely was not the case. It did include a cable, but the cable was so bad, that even with the phone running with just the absolute most basic of functions, I kept getting an error message basically saying that it was exerting more battery usage than it could renew with the piece of junk cable I had received. Amazon did agree to furnish me with a new cable, but it would have been nice to have a functional cable from the get-go, as I had to make a mad dash to Best Buy just to make sure my phone would be up and running for the next few days.Not a bad value for the price, but if you buy something refurbished, I guess the lesson is to keep cosmetic expectations on the lower end of the spectrum, and expect a few hiccups.",2019年10月5日 在美国审核

Happy so far,"Recieved my Note 9 in the color I ordered. Came with 1 tiny scratch on screen (so small only noticed when cleaning to put on protector) and scratches on one outer corner (not large enough to be concerned with). Being a ""renewed"" phone it isn't surprising that it isn't completely perfect. But the physical flaws are minute. I'm new to android so I might not be the best on a tech review but everything so far seems to be working well, the phone was indeed factory unlocked, and was easy to use through my carrier with proper SIM. The battery doesn't seem to last as long as it says but honestly is probably because I'm still trying to figure out how to turn off extra sounds and notifications. In my opinion (as of now, only 4 days with it), seems to be a good deal for price.Oh and I seen that some mention wanting to know where/company reviewers recieved their phones from... the company on my packing slip reads: Tech Excahngee out of Brooklyn NY (as well as) TECHEXCHANGEE.

"Beat Up, Used, Dirty, &amp; Broken","For close to $500 after tax, you too can buy a completely used and beat up cell phone! These ""renewed"" phones are absolute crap and is actually a scam. I ended up ordering three of these phones and floating $1,500 out just trying to get a phone that wasn't completely jacked up. the first phone that I received was all scratched up on the back glass and after turning it on and spending an hour getting it set up I realized that the edge of the screen had dead pixels on it. The second phone came and the front glass touch screen was completely scratched up so I didn't even bother turning that on. The third phone came and the back glass along with the front glass was completely scratched up as well. this phone was even showing silver on the bottom where the paint had all been scratched off and scraped. Again I didn't even bother turning on that piece of junk. so in the end all three are going back and I won't be ordering another because all they are are used phones that are completely messed up and they aren't even ""renewed"" at all. Usually when electronics are refurbished they use completely fixed cosmetically and any major hardware issues are fixed. These phones are just shipped right from the previous owner by the looks of it. What a waste of time and money. For $486 these phones should be spotless!",2020年6月11日 在美国审核

Inspect The Quality of renewed devices don't buy into the hype of the word renewed,"The phone Works great, battery life is excellent. The one thing I can take way is inspect your device once you receive it, Take it out into direct sunlight and examine it. Don't be fooled by the words renewed nor by reviewers that say my phone was in almost brand new condition, that may not be the case with your unit. Of course I don't expect the device to be flawless but I didn'texpect the condition to be in the words of that famous kiss song(Catch Scratch Fever) On the front and back of the phone. I was going to the return the phone but I lost the Bluetooth SPen, went to Amazon a mistakenly bought the non Bluetooth Spen thinking it was the original so I am not going to defraud anybody by returning this phone without the Actually SPen. I will save up $65 dollars and purchase the pen later, Overall Solid Device if you lose the pen just consider it like a S9 Plus with a boxy shape",2021年5月16日 在美国审核

Disappointed (December to March),"I got this phone beginning of December. The S Pen was not connecting with the device right from the beginning, but I decided to overlook that. Then, during phone calls, one of the speakers was going on and off. It still is. And now (March), top of the cake, when I record videos or just voice messages, there is huge white background noise, even when I am using headphones. Therefore the phone is pretty much useless for the scope. I am highly disappointed, wasted $350, and now I cannot even return it unfortunately, because the return window is gone. The phone had all these issues just within 3.5 months from purchase. I had way higher expectations from Amazon. Sad.",2021年3月12日 在美国审核

Note 9,"The device itself is awesome! I purchased this used (or refurbished?) and the phone I received from this particular company was ok in looks but in the package there was a distinct battery smell. I turned the phone on and everything seemed to work fine, however when I went to plug it up, I couldn't due to the batter port being damaged. (Guess that's why I smelled battery?) So, I informed the sender and they told me to return the phonefor a new one or for a refund. I wanted to give them another chance so I opted to get another phone. The 2nd phone came in 2-4 days later, after I sent the other phone back. So far this phone is doing well, only thing about it is the speaker is not in the best shape. On my calls ppl say that they can't hear me well when on speaker or sometimes it will randomly make it where others can't hear me on the speaker. It's not bad enough to send back but I am not sure how much longer the speaker will last. Overall, fairly decent for the price given the features, age, etc.",2022年1月27日 在美国审核

I will say that I got a bit worried once I started up my phone it said that my sim card( from cricket wireless)was incompatible with the phone( from verizon).

At least for today everything has gone very smooth. The condition of the phone is very nice, minimal scratches, a few notable dents on the body of the phone but nothing that couldn't be covered up with a good case.

"First Amazon Renewed Purchase, will be my last","I bought this phone on August 26, 2020. It's now February 17, 2021, and I have to pay to get it fixed. I paid $416.22 for my phone, now I have to pay another $100+ (depending on what parts need to be replaced) to fix it. I could have bought a new mid-range phone with that money, I didn't, but you can. When I try to charge my phone, a Moisture Detected Error pops up. I've tried almost everything out there that was recommended online to fix it. I've cleaned the charging port, tried a different wall charger and cable, rebooted it, tried charging in safe mode, I've wiped cache partition, almost everything! Except for a factory reset, I refuse to do that, I shouldn't have to do that.When I first received the phone, cosmetically it was fair. It came with that dent/scratch near the pen, it didn't bother me, that's to be expected with a second-hand phone. In retrospect, what I'm about to tell you guys is sketchy and dishonest on their part, but they fooled me, so I guess it's not that big of a deal. Beware of the following. My phone came with a tempered glass screen protector, I thought ""Wow, how nice, they even threw in a screen protector for me!"" Wrong!! Like a month and a half ago, the protector was practically falling off, so I just took it off. And lo and behold, the screen is littered with scratches. You can't tell in the pictures because I already put a new screen protector on it, and like I said, the scratches don't affect the screen quality. But I feel cheated. Performance-wise, then and now, it's great. Some of the reviews on here say, that their phone didn't come fully unlocked, but thankfully, mine did. No problems there.I hope this review helps you make your final decision on whether or not to purchase this phone or any other Renewed device. This is my first time ever purchasing a second-hand electronic device, I always buy new. If you think about it's actually not that bad, $500+ for a flagship device. But, not even 6 months with the phone and I have to pay to get it fixed!! Roll the dice, maybe your experience will be better.",2021年2月17日 在美国审核

Screen Burn-In issues,"My experience was initially good with this product but only after 2-weeks of use I have screen burn in where my navigation buttons are. My use has been very light on and off use which mainly consists of watching YouTube and reading. My screen brightness is always at 30-40% (unless in direct sunlight) with adaptive brightness turned off. I'm very aware of AMOLED screen burn in issues and usually try to mitigate it by having my brightness low and using dark themes to not use the pixels too much. That is why it seems improbable that my use would cause this issue. More than likely the previous owner burned the display out and the refurbisher did a poor job of vetting the phone as in ""like-new"" condition. It's essentially a ticking time bomb of when those pixels are going to die.Overall I'm very disappointed in a product like this and expect better support.I only give 2 stars: 1 for the fact that aside from the screen burn-in, there was no visible damage or scratches on the body, and 1 for the battery that was in decent condition and not completely shot.",2020年3月31日 在美国审核

"RENEWED: Great Price, But battery wont last through a day, replacing battery is difficult.","I purchased this phone because of all the features.One of the features that sold me was the long battery life.This phone can be fully charged in the morning and by noon its at 25 percent.It definitely will not last for an entire day, unless I just dont use it at all.I thought the phone was supposed to have 85 to 90 percent battery life left, mine did not.I might return it because this is not acceptable and to change the battery is a pain because you literally have to heat the phone to soften the adhesive and pry apart the adhesive and try not to damage anything.Don't know if I could do that without breaking it.So i guess I wasted time setting the phone up since i will most likely return it.If you can afford it,get a new phone NOT a renewed phone.Especially since changing the battery is kinda difficultThe actual phone looked like it was brand new without a single scratch on it,and it works fine.It is a great phone.It did not come with any accessories except a generic charger and plug.If you know how to open the phone and change the battery than this would be a great deal.",2020年3月9日 在美国审核

"Seems to work fine, but scratched, packed w/ crappy screen saver hanging off, &amp; generic accessories","Having been heavily involved in the mobile phone repair, refurbishing and reverse logistics business for a few years, a few years back, I expected more from an Amazon certified ""renewed"" product and seller.I received the Note 9 today after a 5 day shipping time (thats with PRIME).First off, the phone is in a bubble bag, inside a generic white box, with NO spacer or even bubble wrap to hold the phone handset from flopping around inside the box that is at least 4 inches longer than the phone and the generic ""Ashley"" charger and cable were all moving around as well.The battery was at 1% when I turned it on, and the phone had to be charged before I could set it up.The back of the handset has significant scratches on the lower edge (see photos), and there was a cheap glass screen saver attached to the front of handset....which I quickly discovered interfered greatly in the touch screen operation on the right side. I removed it immediately and was relieved to find that at least the touch screen was fully functional.I tested all functionality with Samsung's internal 'secret code' test mode and all checked OK, though the S pen seemed to hang up a bit.I will test the handset fully tomorrow with SIM card on a T-Mobile MVNO network.Assuming it all tests well, I will keep the phone, but think at this price at least the 'renewed' (we used to call it refurbished) wouldn't be scratched and original accessories would be included, and that the seller would at least charge the handset before shipping....and think about protecting it in the box for transit.",2019年12月3日 在美国审核

Had no idea Back of phone is also glass,"Its a decent phone I like a lot of features, functions and capabilities of this phone. Ut Nothing's super stellar enough to specifically mention. But overall it all works just fine. A bit slower than i expected and a weak signal at times, seems to be a bit finicky about the charging cord, battery seems to drain quicker than I'm used to. Biometrics are a bit on the slow side to recognize me. Non of those are a a deal breaker for me. The only thing I despise about this phone is how fragile it is! Its got glass on the front and glass on the back, even though I have it in a sturdy leather wallet case with a screen protector I somehow shattered the back glass ???!!! In less than a month of owning it! I've had my IPhone 11 for well over 1 year and not a crack, dent, scratch anywhere on it.

Incredible value,"Totally blown away by the quality of this renewed Note 9. The phone looks like new. It is totally awesome. No scratches on the screen, none on the back or on the edges, it really does look like new. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 (4 1/2 if I could) is the packaging it arrived in. It could easily have been damaged, as the only protection was the padded envelope. But the phone is amazing. To think that this cost over $1000 when new, and believe me, it looks and performs like new, it is a great buy. Once loaded up there was the new updated Android 10 and the new 2.0 UI from Samsung. Without seeming like a parrot. This really is like a new phone. ....... Highly recommended.",2020年5月2日 在美国审核

Not as advertised,"The model I received was a note 9 sm960f which is the Exynos variant. Which means it’s a cheaper version and not as good as the American snapdragon models. In addition the phones screen is more weathered than my s8 that I used until the s21 came out. The frame is also dented and the phone was quite filthy with grime and debris still stuck in the ports. Hardly what I’d call refurbished. In addition the big giveaway is the fact it still has all the telstra bloat ware from Australia. I wouldn’t recommend it unless they discounted it heavily, and even then it’s a stretch.",2021年11月23日 在美国审核

I went back to my S9+ which has crystal clear voice commincation and dictation.

I got a lemon...,"I am a huge fan of the Samsung Note flagship. I really wanted to get the Note 9 because it was the last Note made with a 3.5mm headphone slot; the Amazon renewed was my only option given the budget I set for the phone.Pros:- Even though it is renewed, the phone came with only a little scratch, not more than 1mm in length on the back of the phone, which is acceptable for a renewed phone- Good battery life- Fast fingerprint-unlock recognitionCons:- Many times, the charging slot does not recognize the genuine Samsung USB-C and charger; it either shows it is charging slowly or detects moisture (I know the phone is 100% dry). I had to purchase a wireless charger for that reason. That can become cumbersome when I am on the go and I need to charge my phone- Flashlight in the back is not as bright as my Note 8 that I also own- AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I HATE ABOUT THIS PHONE: the person on the other side of the phone call hears an echo of his/her own voice. I have to use headphones or a Bluetooth headset all the time to have a coherent conversation with anyone",2021年3月31日 在美国审核

This is the second time I boughtthis phone on Amazon and both times they were not the factory unlocked model! My other Samsung Note 9 was unlocked but a Sprint model. For me, it is important to have the factory unlocked model because it does not contain all the bloatware like Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and all the other carriers pre-install on their phones. You cannot delete their bloatware and it wastes a lot of space.",2019年7月3日 在美国审核

My carrier is Verizon and I have never had call quality issues.I know the microphone works well because there are no issues with video or audio recordings.Apparently I'm not the only one who has experienced this voice-quality problem with a Samsung Note 9. I tried the online solutions, but to no avail.Unfortunately, unlike other purchases where I usually get 30 days to ship the item back after I request a refund, in this case I got only one day. I used 89 of the 90 days we get for certified refurbished phone purchases, because I really didn't want to return this otherwise beautiful phone. I wanted to try all the suggested fixes to the problem before giving up. As a result I only got one day to ship the item back afterward. I didn't realize this until it was too late.

Great Phone with a Known Software/Firmware Issue,"Overall, I am happy with my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 .When I initially received my phone, it came in the original box and it was working perfectly.However, after a month my phone began randomly restarting.After doing some investigation, it turns out that there is a known firmware/software issue with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 where the fingerprint scanner gets moisture inside of it and the phone tries to recalibrate the scanner by restarting.Constantly.After some trial and error I got my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 to stop restarting by not allowing the fingerprint scanner to be used to unlock my phone.I can still use my fingerprint to unlock apps, but not even hard restarting allows for me to use my fingerprint scanner to unlock my phone.Everything else on this phone works wonderfully and I would recommend it to anyone, so long as they are happy using iris scanner instead of the fingerprint scanner to unlock their phone.",2020年6月19日 在美国审核

It's a Verizon unlocked phone not factory unlocked. Faulty battery or charger.,"Advertised as a factory unlocked but it was a verizon phone, although it was unlocked and I was able to get my T-mobile sim card to work with phone with not much of a problem. The problem was with the battery- it doesn't seem to hold a charge. After charging to fullovernight, In the middle of the afternoon it will indicate that I only have 15% battery life. That has happened 2 times now, both times strangely enough at 15%. Not sure if it's the generic (cheap) charger, that came with the phone or the phone battery itself. I will test it out with a few more charges and see, or might have to get a better charger, which means I have to spend extra money for :(!<br>I might need to return, but really don't want to because of the inconvenience especially after transferring all my files over to new phone.</br>",2019年10月21日 在美国审核

Everything works on it, sans data (That will be fixed when a new SIM card arrives from my provider) the fingerprint scanner works, the iris/face recognition works wonders. I enjoy this phone, However, the reason this product does not get 5 stars is that I did not receive the crucial part of this phone. The S pen is a very crucial part of the phone and one of the main reasons that I bought it. This product even mentions the S pen inside the description of the product so there is no reason why it shouldn't be with my phone.

I hate this phone. Causes much stress,Don't use facial recognition. Gave battery life five stars.Had a Note 5 and loved it. While I was ill for a year it disappeared.One cannot block calls on this phone unless you memorize the number and go through a couple of stages and then type it in. That makes no sense to me. Why would I want to memorize the numbers of robo calls or any other spam calls. Even worse I cannot hear the phone if it sends a text. On my old phone I could make the ringing of the texts louder than phone calls. I spend hours on the phone with Samsung to no avail. They don't know why Samsung made the newer phone less user friendly. It causes me great stress every day. I truly HATE this phone. There is no improvement from Note 5. Only user friendly options removed.,2022年4月11日 在美国审核

Excellent Phone but with missing box accessories and incorrect charger,"I really like and am enjoying the Note 9. I am very disappointed about not getting the correct accessories in the box when I opened it. First off, the charger I received was not a Fast Charger. I was given a regular 2.0 Amp White Charger. This was the same charger that came with my SG5 back in the day. Lastly, I did not receive the S-Pen extra Tips, S-Pen Ejector Tool, Earbuds or Headphones, Sim Tray Ejector Pin, USB Type C to USB Type A Adapter, and finally the User Guide.This is unacceptable for buying a high end product. I'd like to know if I am going to get compensated for these missing items or get them replaced. How can you sell phones and not include the accessories or the correct charger? The Note 9 has a 4000 Mah Battery. How can you charge this phone without a Fast Charger?I am very unhappy about this purchase.

Recently purchased and Already giving trouble. Phone keeps restarting.,"I purchasedphone about a month ago. Was very hesitant to buy but took a chance. Phone looks new. Justabout 2 areas had fine scratches but apart from that it appeared good.<br>Battery life sucks, even with little use it just dies. Recently started noticing that phone restarts it self. Not sure how long it has been doing it but until recently I started noticing as it happens now about every hour. Tried resetting the phone but nope. Didn't help.I haven't dropped the phone or done any damage to it so I'm assuming its the phone itself.If your thinking about buying this phone to save some money, think twice.

Not quite as described - 1.5 Stars,"My note 9 broke so I looked online for a replacement. Despite those around me saying not to I decided to try a renewed phone. Now I'm not sure how I feel about it after a week of use.Here are the defects I found after a week of use:~The pen doesn't work. As you can see in the photos, the pen doesn't click in all the way and hangs out slightly. This results in the pen not charging and being unusable.~In the description, they say there are no noticeable blemishes from 12 inches, but I can definitely see them from 12 inches. You can see the major blemishes in the photos.~Every now and then maybe 30% of the time the speaker seems to die off. It sounds like the speaker is being covered up and it is hard to hear the person on the other end of the call.~Battery life seems weaker than my previous note 9 which I had for about a year. So, either my previous note 9 retained more than 80% capacity or these ones currently don't have at least 80% capacity as promised.~Data is a bit spotty from time to time. I didn't have these problems with my previous note 9.I'm still debating if I should return it. Just don't expect the ""Product works and looks like new"" promise they have in the description.**EditDecided to return.",2020年2月27日 在美国审核
Do not buy phones from Amazon.,"I would not recommend buying a phone from Amazon. The phone I ordered was supposed to be unlocked and not tethered to any network. It specifically says in the description that it's not.But yet I get the phone and first thing I see is all the verizon logo stuff pop up. It's a Verizon phone. I can text and call but it will not allow me access to my data plan. Will not allow me to update APN setting to fix this either. The seller game me some b.s. excuse saying that the phone is unlocked from any carrier, that the reason it's showing verizon is because of the SIM they put in it to test it put all the Verizon stuff on there automatically. And that all I need to do is pop in my carrier SIM and it will remove the Verizon stuff and replace it with my carrier stuff. That is not how it works.",2021年12月9日 在美国审核

They turned it on for me to make sure everything was okay with the phone. Turns out it was for T-Mobile. Seriously!!! You can’t use t-mobile phones on Verizon and even if it were an option I purchased a Verizon phone. I paid for what I wanted not for what the feel I wanted. Contacted them they pretty much told me oh well. That I could use it. No I can’t. Not even an offer to make it right. Just told oh we’ll send it back.

"Phone is great, but here's the catch.....","Note 9 is operational, in good condition, works as it should. But, here is the catch. They sent me a GSM ATT note 9, instead of the advertised Verizon CDMA note 9. In my situation, it wasn't the BIGGEST deal because I already used a GSM carrier, but was going to go to Verizon. So, the phone still works for me, but, if this were to happen to someone else that had say Verizon and did not want any notion of swapping carrier, this would be problematic for them and they would have to take the time to send it back, get a refund, or send it back to have another sent which raises the risk of it happening again. Best part is when you opened the sim tray, they left in a very beaten old Verizon sim in there like they were trying to insinuate that it was Verizon restored when it was in fact not. Long story short, be careful where you order from.",2020年4月18日 在美国审核

Fully unlocked i think not locked to tmobile,Let me start off by saying the phone is awsome but it is completely false advertising to increase sales. These phone are 100 percent not unlocked as the description claims that they are is a blatant lie then when i ask this seller if they had one that was truly unlocked they tell me to look through there inventory. No thats what you are for breed. You should know your inventory. Although they did send it out and got to me two days earlier tgan expected and the phone was absolutely flawless.

Pro Tip- These Phones are Not Unlocked,This was not compatible with my carrier and tech support could not get it to work. The seller should really sort out which carriers these phones work for and give us options to make sure we are able to order the correct devices. Based on the other reviews it seems like there is a 50/50 chance your phone will work or not. I guess one solution would be to return and rebuy this product over and over until you eventually get one that works. Hopefully Amazon can provide a better solution.,2019年12月6日 在美国审核

"Fragile, poorly balanced, bad notifications","I love this phone. Don't get me wrong. But the screen is so fragile, and easily scratched, and the phone is not balanced right. Regardless of where I put this phone it always falls. And when it falls it hits the screen. My note8 lasted me well over a year and never had this problem. The first week I had this phone the screen just cracked for no reason. Now I dropped it with a case and the corner of the screen shattered. We're talking a four foot drop with a case broke this screen. That's two screens damaged with this phone. My note8 regularly traveled with cheap cases or no case and it had literally no scratches and I NEVER had to replace the screen. I could put my 8 anywhere and it never fell, and if it did, the screen was FINE.My aunt has the same phone. She regularly has no notification sounds or the screen won't light up so she can answer the phone.Between the fragility of the screen, the balance, and the notification issues I'm not impressed with how much it's worth.",2019年10月12日 在美国审核

Read before you buy!,"So I go through straight talk and I was looking for a better phone without having to pay an outrageous amount. Last year I ordered this phone ""UNLOCKED"" only to find out that it was still locked to only Sprint and AT&amp;T. Normally probably wouldn't have been a problem but I live in an area where both of those have no service here. Disappointed, however it was my own fault and should have thought about it before hand. Verizon is the only service here that works amazing in my area so I just ordered the VERIZON edition and can't wait for it to show up around the 9th. That being said. The phone I ordered last year was AMAZING. No dents, scratches. Everything worked better than expected. Phone was in absolute perfect condition and packed very well. I think it even arrived sooner than expected! Even though I made the mistake of ordering the wrong one, I still quite enjoyed using it as a back up for pictures and games that I can't normally download on my measly J7. If you have read into this comment so far, Just be smart about it. Just because a phone says it is unlocked, doesn't necessarily mean it is unlocked to your specific carrier.Pick the service you actually want. If your provider isn't listed then contact the carrier you go through and ask them what works best with their service. That simple. If I would have taken the time to actually ask what would be best and compatible with Straight Talk I wouldn't have made that mistake in the beginning. Anyway, Excited for the new one to get here soon! Can't wait to get rid of my J7! :)",2022年3月3日 在美国审核

I had it plugged into USB 3 cable, only after I realized that it would not charge using cable (did try other known good USB 3.0 cables).

My main issue is I need to take this with me when traveling, and I do not have the available time to return &amp; replace now, so I am stuck with the phone. By time I get back the return period will have ended. Still no idea if phone works well or not, very frustrated this had to happen and certainly a lot of bad timing. However phone was obviously never tested or checked, so I assume I will have to buy a new one soon.",2021年12月13日 在美国审核

"Screen burn, other problems","After a few day's use, I noticed that some icons and status bar (from an older version of the OS lock screen) were burned into the screen. Noticeable on a white background (like when drawing, which is where I first saw it), very noticeable against grey or blue. Color-cycling app didn't ""fix"" it completely. Definitely does not meet the standard of ""unnoticeable at arms length"".I had to pay hundreds of dollars to have a new screen put in. And then even more to have the battery replaced and a new back installed when they discovered the old one had blown out some.The included charger (or the phone itself) doesn't fast charge.The camera (still) has a bad internal glare at night with flash activated (when exposure is high) that I never saw with my S8.It's a Note 9, so it's a good phone, but overall this particular one was pretty messed up, and even after spending a bunch more money on it, it's still not in perfect shape.It was a gift, so I don't know who specifically fulfilled my order, but they should be fired until they improve their QA process.",2021年1月19日 在美国审核
"Im not a verified customer, However Im a real homie.","Heres the facts. The hard facts.I got my Note 9 from Sprint, in a nutshell Sprint is a 2.5 Star of 5. But this aint that.The Note 9 is a beast of a product. Fragile sure but its a power house. I upgraded to this phone from the S7 so maybe I just think its so awesome coming from a 2 yr gap, but Im sure I know my tech and I know what impresses me.Believe me if you want, this aint even my account my grandma has unlimited prime so I just be using this lol. THE NOTE 9 IS A BEAST! Anything you could want in a phone. However I will leave my Pros, and Cons.Pros:- Im going to make this short...... You couldnt be unhappy with this phone. No compromises.- The facial and eye reading stuff makes unlocking a breeze in tight situations where you can particularly touch your finger sensor or draw in your code. Just facial is faster but face and eyes are best security.Cons:- I feel the curved edges make screen protection difficult. Ive went though 3 tempered glass protectors, all cheaper ones. Havent tried whitestone yet because of price, however I have tried Ni-Shen liquid adhesion, Wehasi 2 pack, and also WTOSE's protectors, none of which worked well sent all of them back.- Cases made for this phone, because of the curved edges, make it difficult to find the right case, I sent 1 back and got an otterbox symmetry series case, which also does not fully protect the screen in a drop because the lifted beveled edges do not protect the screen when dropped on a jagged edge.Overview:Its the best phone Ive had. Im not really rough on my phones so I dont mind the edges and I pay insurance through a carrier, so its not a major deal to me.Buying this unlocked you take on the full responsibility of repairs so I cannot speak on the seller, nor their product. This is simply a review on the phone itself.",2019年3月26日 在美国审核
Do Not Buy,Bought this as a replacement for my Note 5 which I enjoyed until it abruptly failed to turn on one day. Tried replacing the battery to no avail so I replaced it with the Note 9. I loved this phone until after owning it for 1 year and 2 weeks. While using my phone today the screen abruptly dimmed/faded and took on a green hue. It is functional but it’s terribly ugly and puts a strain on the eyes. I will NEVER buy another Samsung phone again,2020年6月21日 在美国审核

I'm very happy with it.Works perfectly.However, I know that occasionally refurbished phones work great until they don't.Sometimes they start out fine and after a few months, you run into an unknown or unforseen glitch.

"So far, so good","I got this product for my fiancee, since he needed an upgrade from his Note 4.He was going to a get refurbished one from ebay, but when I read the reviews for the refurbished phones here, I figured if it is almost as good as new, then why not? It has been under 2 weeks since he had it and he just activated it last weekend, but he likes it so far.Longer battery life, the GPS tracker is not as slow, and he has more camera features.He did mention about the phone using more energy when he is using it to take pictures and video (the phone gets warm to hot), since the processing of pictures uses more energy (?) Is this common for Note phones (or the Note 9)?I would not know since I am an iphone user.The Note 9 also uses a different charger from his Note 4, so he had to buy the additional accessories.But so far, so good.",2019年2月26日 在美国审核

Samsung Certified Renewed Does Not Equal Good Quality Control,"I was gifted a renewed Note 9 to replace my current Note 9, because AT&amp;T's 3G sunsetting arbitrarily means they cannot support any phones that aren't specifically US versions.

Samsung renewed is the way to go!,"I have a Note10+ that I bought new almost two years ago and I love. I mean my phone has it all. My husband's old dumb phone is now obsolete so I wanted to get him something as awesome as my Note10+, but money is tighter now than it was two years ago. The Samsung renewed Note9 looks brand spanking new! It came in a new sexy Samsung box with all new doodads. It has the same warranty as new. This phone sells for double the price as new on Samsung. So half price for a phone you can't tell is renewed is a no brainer. From now on if I ever need to upgrade, I will do Samsung renewed. But I sure hope that doesn't happen for many many years.The phone itself is pretty darn close to as wonderful as my Note10+. I can tell the difference in the camera, but I'm a photographer.It works the same and has an artillery of functions built in. It's fine for my husband. The phone is slightly smaller than the Note10+, but barely a difference. I think this screen is possibly safer from breaking than the Note10+, as it doesn't go all the way to the edge.I don't like the Bixby button on the left side, as I have a power button there on my phone, so as I was setting up the Note9 for my husband, I've repeatedly pressed it, bringing up Bixby. But I imagine it will be no problem for my husband as he does not have that habit.The finger print scanner being next to the camera seems like a bad idea. My husband keeps touching the camera to use it, but hopefully he'll get better at it. On a Note10+ the finger print scanner just shows up on the screen when you need it and then disappears. Much better.The pen is great! You will love using it. It is not a dumb pen like in other types of phones, but a bluetooth that can do stuff to blow your mind. There's this dude I will mention further in this review, he can help you learn all about that. I recommend an app called Sketchbook for drawing and art stuff. While the Notes app is good, this one has a ton more features and art supplies. I just discovered it today, thanks to my daughter's recommendation and it's a pretty big difference. It's free and apparently beloved by many artists.The phone updated to Android 10 and One UI 2.5, in case anyone wants to know. I think that may be as high as they go.Pretty much everything else works the same as the Note10+.I think we got a great deal and I'm happy my poor husband finally has a smart phone.Something I recommend to everyone I know: We do BYOP on Tracfone. We do not select their low monthly payments, just the occasional adding on of data and minutes. It's so cheap there and they use AT&amp;T towers. Same great coverage and we don't have ridiculous monthly payments. Since this is his first smart phone I had to buy a year card with them (normally $120) and I found a $50 off coupon for that at TracfoneReviewer online. There's always coupon codes for tracfone there. With my Note10+ I spend no more than $160 a year for minutes, data, text, and time. That's it. It's always been enough. I highly recommend Tracfone. Don't sign up for a monthly plan with them. It's not necessary. And you can always do that if you find you need it. Also their prices are upfront. No added fees. Ever. Just saying. You're already thrifty looking at a renewed phone, go all the way! Save money. We've been using Tracfone for 17 years at least. If you think you are interested in doing that, make sure to order the Tracfone Sim Card kit with this phone. It is usually anywhere from $1 if it's sold by Amazon, or $5 from a private seller. Free if you ask Tracfone, but be prepared to wait forever for it to arrive. Depending on where you live you could end up using Verizon, AT&amp;T, or TMobile towers. The Tracfone website let's you know which SIM card you will need.Now, this next piece of advice is gold. There's this awesome tech guru on youtube called sakitech. He has 1.5 million subscribers for a reason. Look for ""250+ Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Tips, Tricks and Hidden Features"" by Sakitech and set some times aside. Go at your own pace. You too will be a Sammy guru when you're done. You will know how to do all kinds of stuff on your Samsung Note9 (or 10+ if you go that route, he has a video for that too). I'm so glad I saw his Note10+ video. It helped me to get more out of my phone from day one. And he is easy to understand.Oh yeah I noticed the bad reviews in this listing. That was for other sellers. As long as it says SHIPS AND SOLD BY AMAZON, and it is SAMSUNG CERTIFIED RENEWED, you are golden. If not, as you can see from the bad reviews, well you're playing the Amazon seller lottery.Okay, I've done what I can here. I like helping people and I hope my tidbits have helped you.

I got what I ordered (an unlocked used note 9),"Ok I get it. Some people say they didn't get what they ordered. I did. I got a note 9 in excellent condition and unlocked. It works with metro PCS (T-Mobile towers) and had no issues getting put on my plan. I'm not saying other people didn't have issues but I will be ordering a second one for someone else on my plan. I don't know why some orders are better than others and if I get a bad phone on my second order I will update this one as well as saying so on the review for that one, but as for now I got what I wanted and I'm not sure the ""scam"" is on the sellers side. Just remember people want stuff for free; so if they think a bad review will get them something for nothing they will put heart and soul into it. Our society is sad and there's definitely alot of ""I deserve"". Just tell people you got what you got. Don't talk crap about something if it's not true. If you wrote a bad review for something and it didn't deserve it then you should be ashamed; then again if you were able to then of course you won't feel bad about doing so. You think every company can afford every sing person getting free stuff. It's sad... Just so sad. People like that don't understand saying ""they can afford it"" means bankruptcy. Imagine how many people say it every day. You think you are the only one trying to scam a company? You are not even close to the first person to think of that ""scam"". You are just another freeloader trying to get something you don't deserve. Stop ruining small business trying to make your life better. You will still be bitter and angry that no one likes you. Just because you have a new phone doesn't make you cooler or more important and telling people you got it for free because you cried about something makes people like you less. Pay for what you get and get what you pay for. If you don't like it then send it back. Stop expecting to get an amazing deal because everyone is thinking just like you; make money and don't get taken advantage of.",2021年12月3日 在美国审核

It came in great condition with a Samsung fast charging cable and box and the sim card removing tool. I put my cricket wireless sim card in and it was good to go. I'm very happy with my purchase so far and its pretty awesome they give you 90 days to return it if need be.

If you are hesitating, keep in mind that most providers have a ""Bring Your Own Device"" option, so check with your provider.The seller was very helpful, and offered support for any problem that may arise. Having an unlockeddevice is essential, but sometimes the model number could be an issue with your phone service provider. No worries though, because that can be resolved by ""flashing"" the device.

"A great, heavily customizable phone","I bought this to replace a Pixel 3a XL. So far it has been a great replacement, with comparable battery life and several great features (although it can feel a bit bloated at times). The best part is I was able to use the same third party launcher (Nova) rather than the default to keep my home screen clean and apps well organized. The pen is fun to use although it takes some getting used to, especially for drawing. One thing I can do without is the Bixby button, but you can change it so that the button can open apps or functions so that's neat. Overall this is a great phone that I'll hopefully be using for a long time.",2021年12月10日 在美国审核
Very dissatisfied. Not worth it.,"I received the phone and it looked decent for a used phone. The ""sim removal tool"" was a paperclip. It worked but they should just say a paperclip because I almost threw it away because it's not what the description said. The phone worked great for about a week then it started resetting and powering down on it's own at random times then almost constantly. Also the battery dies very quickly. After a day or so of trying to figure out what was wrong with no solution, it started working normally again. Then a few days later it starts messing up doing the same thing again. This time I contacted the seller and they ran me through the normal things that I found on google that I already tried. And when all else failed they wanted me to send it back. I couldn't send it back right away because I don't have that option at work so they offered a partial refund. I assumed on a $270 purchase it would be at least 50% but they offered $25. And after I told them that it was an insult to receive such a low refund for a malfunctioning phone that I had for a week, they stopped responding altogether.",2021年7月15日 在美国审核

Great phone,"So far the phone is pretty good I've had the phone since January 24th and it's now march 26, It's been pretty good it serves its usage for what a phone should do. The battery life is great I normally don't need to recharge it everyday usually its 2 or 3 days. The response of the phone is perfect, Apps install super fast compared to my old phone and tablet.My only con to this phone is I would have to go to a store to get the battery replaced if the battery ever goes bad but great phone nonetheless.",2022年3月27日 在美国审核

Quality and fast &amp; capable customer support.,"I was very concerned about buying renewed for $400 items, especially a cell.But Hybrid IT was right on top of customer care.The main thing is the phone works well &amp; not looking damaged.The accessories were secondary.However, this one came with the phone and charger (not oem).The charging cable was a slow one and I mentioned it to the seller. In less than a day, a customer rep called me to handle it. She said they would a refund me,( a very fair $) to get a cable here. I found a fast cable at a dollar store, plugged into their adapter, and all is well.I would buy from Hybrid IT again.I did not test all of the ph capabilities yet, but it covered all my concerns so far.It doesn't matter that it was a sprint unlocked. I put in my nano sim from T-mobile and it moved seamlessly.Same with the smart switch from my pre-owned Amazon Note 5, all moved over fine.If all renewed and refurbished worked this way, there is no reason not to buy.",2020年8月31日 在美国审核

At first after connecting it to wifi it will start doing all the updates and it might take a whole entire day till it gets the latest version. I also bought a cover so it will protect it.

Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Review,"I had the Note 8 and wanted to upgrade, and upgrade I did. Had a few issues with this phone at first, but most turned out to be Tmobiles fault, the rest were due to apps I installed. All in all I would say buy this phone if you wanta powerful smartphone that is both functional and looks good, even more so than the newer note 10, not so much the 10 plus though. If you have the money and absolutely have to have the best that's out there buy the Note 10 plus, otherwise this is the better value. Very pleased with this purchase.

So relieved,I have always bought my Samsung Notes new but when my Note 8's is camera broke it was time to look into an upgrade. The days of me paying a $1000 for a phone were long gone in my head so a new Note 10 or 20 were out of the question.The Note 9 however has always appealed to me as the last great Note series with even better battery life than the newer Notes.It was selling at a good price for a renewed version on Amazon so I took a leap of faith and bought one.I say a leap of faith because one I had never bought used and two I had heard horror stories and read horrible reviews about people who had such bad experiences buying renewed phone.I was a bit skeptical to say the least but I bought the Note 9 anyway and I can honestly say I could not be happier with its condition and how quickly it was delivered. I would not be able to tell that the phone had ever been used before because it came in perfect and pristine condition.I even received an actual Samsung charger with it which many people in their reviews complained the seller would send some cheap knock off charger instead.Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones and only time will tell if the battery lasts and everything keeps working as great as it is now but for now I am thrilled with my decision to buy the phone.,2020年10月17日 在美国审核

Phone locked to Sprint,"I ordered this phone as a replacement for my Note 8 after the screen went bad, and upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised that it looked brand new. It arrived 2 days ahead of the projected shipping date, but I was unable to activate it. Upon further investigation, I discovered that it was locked to Sprint. I contacted Sprint to attempt to unlock it, and they stated that they couldn't unlock it without specific information about the previous account that it was linked to, which I would have to obtain from the seller.I then contacted Amazon customer care, and they stated that as Prime Mobility is a third party seller, all they could do on my behalf was email the seller and submit a request for them to contact me. The seller contacted me in less than 24 hours and informed me that they were unable to unlock the phone for me or provide the information necessary for me to have Sprint unlock the phone, and that I would have to submit a return request, leaving me to have to shop around for another phone and wait additional days with no functioning phone or spend money out of pocket on a cheap phone from walmart while I wait for a new phone that meets my needs to arrive.I am very frustrated, and for the price, I expected the product that I ordered to be as advertised-fully unlocked to all carriers.

"Similar to new, with one small defect","I purchased my product from Hybrid IT. Looking up my IMEI number, my device was originally purchased about a year and a half before I bought it (in March 2019). My model number is SM-N960U1, which means I got the US Snapdragon version that was originally factory unlocked (despite me purchasing an AT&amp;T locked phone). The original owner apparently used Sprint on it, but after uninstalling the Sprint software it worked just like a normal factory unlocked processor.For anyone looking to purchase a Galaxy Note 9 two years after its launch, know you're getting a great phone hardware-wise but which will probably stop receiving software updates soon. I plan on using the Microsoft Launcher after OneUI Home started taking 10% of my battery life, and switching to LineageOS once security updates stop later this year.Pros + It came in rather good condition, albeit with a couple small scuff marks along the side and some dust in the speaker grill. + Almost all the features I've tried so far seem to work without issue (WiFi, Bluetooth, most S Pen funtionality, Dolby Atmos, DeX, wireless charging, heatbeat sensor, iris scanning) + My battery health was 93%, well in excess of Amazon's minimum of 80% That means my battery capacity is 3700 mAh instead of the original 4000 mAh, which is enough for my phone to last a good 6-7 hours with the screen on right now.Cons - It came in a nondescript box (no markings, definitely not original), with no particular packaging material aside from a bubble wrap sleeve. I also received no original documentation and none of the replacement S Pen tips/tip remover that normally comes with the Galaxy Note 9. The tip provided seems to have been one of the softer ones - softer than my preference, but OK. - The S Pen's EMR technology works properly, but it's wireless connectivity seems to be shot. Either the internal supercapacitor is dead and can't hold a charge, or the wireless communication circuitry is broken. It's also possible that this is a cheap clone S-pen without wireless capabilities. - It wasn't updated to the latest OneUI version before factory reset, which required an hour-long download before I could reliably use it---Minor pluses that aren't really device-specific - Using bxActions to remap the Bixby button to Google Assistant worked!Minor issues that might not be device-specific (none of my friends have a Note 9 for me to compare to) - None of the GCam ports I've tried work on this phone - The mechanical shutter is quite loud for some reason - The face unlock/iris scanning reliability is a little iffy - Fingerprint recognition takes a while to register when using LastPass",2020年8月23日 在美国审核

This phone stole my heart. Goodbye Pixel 4!,"I'm obsessed with this phone. It's definitely big, and took a small adjustment period to get used to holding my phone with two hands lol. It's super light weight. Battery life is pretty solid, and it has so many battery saving options to extend it even further. The screen is super adjustable, from the lighting/dim/dark mode, all the way to this thing called ""edge"", which is the edges all around the screen. I'm obsessed with the edge color flash! I love that I can do 5x6 icons and fit more of my apps on one slide. I have straight talk and after a little bit of customer support, I got my phone fully working with a new sim. It comes with a fast charger, and it takes a C charger, which is awesome cause I had a pixel 4 before and it took Usb C as well! I'm so grateful to finally have a fingerprint reader back too! The space on it is a lifesaver. The stylus and drawing apps are awesome. They even have a tattoo ink style of writing that, again, I'm OBSESSED with. You can take pictures and stuff with the stylus as well. This is probably thee most customizable awesome phone I've ever held in my hand. And I've been all the way from iphone to Android to Google pixels. So far I definitely prefer this phone to the pixel 4. I had the pixel 3 before and loved it the most until this one.

So far a great transaction and product - Note9,"Any concerns I had about buying used were lifted by this transaction and the virtually new Note 9.. Have used it for over a week and tested everything.

"Calidad a buen precio, pero accesorios deficientes","Ahora mismo lo estoy probando llevo 4 días con el y hasta el momento todo va perfecto, con la excepción de que llega en un empaque muy muy diferente al original, pero yo creo que eso es lo de menos ya que al tener un celular de esta calidad por ese precio vaya, no hay problema alguno, lo malo es que el cargador con el que lo recibí se calienta horrible y no carga el celular se tarda horas.

Excelente Amazon,"Es la segunda vez que compro un producto Renewed y afortunadamente me han salido muy bien, en este caso era importante ya que no era para mí…Sólo hay dos detalles a considerar.1. El distribuidor DHL abrió el paquete, se nota como fue cortado e incluso mayugado para meterlo y sacarlo del empaque que Amazon envía. MUY MAL. Yo me espanté terriblemente porque bien podían cambiar el paquete por otra cosa y se haría irrasteable el mismo. Ni si quiera tuve que abrir la caja esta vez con un cutter o tijeras, sólo meter mi mano que cabía perfectamente…2. El celular venía descargado en su totalidad, lo que significa un peligro ya que al ser importado y puede ser un viaje largo, la batería al llegar al 0% definitivo puede morir y llegar al destinatario sin poder utilizarae.Afotunadamente ninguno de los inconvenientes pasó a una tragedia…Recomendaría que si Amazon contrata a otro distribuidor externo, como lo fue DHL; el destinatario les tomara sus datos e incluso una foto de cómo recibe y por quién recibe, por si hay algún inconveniente como a mí me pasó.Los puntos realmente buenos que tuve con el proveedor fueron que éste me dio cargador, cable y adaptador originales. También me dieron la plumita para sacar la sim o la memoria. Lo cual me sorprendió mucho ya que al comprar estos productos te dan accesorios genéricos.Sin duda alguna recomendados.",2021年11月8日 在墨西哥审核

Stop researching phones and get the Note 9!,3 days in and I can already tell this is the best phone I have ever had. Phone arrived very fast and in mint condition. If someone used this phone they must have been very careful with it because I would have assumed this phone is new. It has small but important features like the LED notification light and the headphone jack that the Note 10 does not have. And of course wireless charging is built in and is a huge game changer. Even though its almost 2 years old this is the best phone you can buy in my opinion.,2020年7月4日 在加拿大审核
Awesome phone,"Got this phone to replace my Huawei p20 pro. Was used to front mounted fingerprint sensor but am finding the rear mounted one on this phone is more comfortable to use.The camera has a ""single shot"" feature that automatically pics out the best pics and small clip videos over a set time which I thought was pretty cool.Am loving the stylus function as I can edit things quickly on the go, or let my daughter play with the coloring book when she's bored.Phone is very responsive, with a very good battery life, and beautiful display.Absolutely a worthwhile phone and I highly recommend ",2021年10月10日 在加拿大审核

Ordered a new cheap Lucky mobile SIM for my mother in law who arrived in Canada to help with kids, It works well in Canada. She is happy. Thank you Toronto Cellular very much!In our situation ordering new expensive phones makes no sense as we have small children, and few new phones have broken displays. Fixing is expensive, so, the option to purchase refurbished from Toronto Cellular instead of repairing was an excellent idea. We have purchased 5 phones from Toronto Cellular within 3 months already and only one needed warranty replacement. Exchange was easy, fast and efficient due to excellent customer service. Hope there will be no need to change any one again. And we know where to order in case kids break the phone again.Thank you Toronto Cellular for your excellent service.",2021年12月9日 在加拿大审核

Not for Canada,"I am very disappointed with this product. The phone itself is amazing, and came in great condition, but stating that it is fully unlocked is an outright lie. The phone I received is a Verizon model,with the CSC locked to verizon. This means I cannot get software updates unless I have a Verizon sim card. Also, since this is the US snapdragon version, I cannot unlock the OEM to do any firmware updates myself.Nov-19 security is not ok with me, nor should it be ok with anyone else. This phone should not be sold in the Canadian marketplace if it cant be used properly in Canada.

Phone itself is like new,"Arrived a day early. Overall good condition, there was only a single scratch on the back which isn't too noticeable. Battery seems to be new. It didn't come with the original box and the unofficial charger was in very bad condition and speed was only 0.7 amps (very slow) however that was expected since the listing said so. Came with the original S Pen which is also in like new condition, didn't notice a single scratch on that. Got it for my Canadian Public Mobile Sim and all the features work perfectly. (Some reviews said that they couldn't send images via text/MMS, but I never had that issue.) The phone I got was truly unlocked and didn't have any carrier-related bloatware. Also for those wondering it does not come with a screen protector. Overall satisfied!Edit: forgot to update this review in a while. Started noticing problems with the original phone on the second day, the signal was very poor no matter where I was and it had a hard time receiving/sending messages and calls, seems like the antenna was defective. Sent back and ordered the same one again, this time it was a good working one. Also it arrived with the stock Samsung charger, cable, sim tool, screen protector and a 1 month koodo trial sim. Only things I've noticed is that the fingerprint ready came very scratched but it still works very quickly. Currently using the phone for several months and still no issues.",2021年3月15日 在加拿大审核

Beware buying from this company,"So this is my second time buying a Note9 from this ""certified refurbished"" company on Amazon.The first phone was in great shape, and worked well (for three weeks). One day it just shut down, and never turned on again. I took it to a Samsung authorized repair center, and they said there was water damage (not recent) and that the motherboard was covered in rust.I've never had this phone come close to getting wet by any means, so obviously it was water damaged prior to me taking delivery.I ended up sending that one back, and getting another one. The second one looks like it was beat on pretty bad by the last owner.

A bit disappointed,"Bought the ""Canadian Version"" of the refurbished Note 9, but I'm not sure it's actually the Canadian version and there are a few issues. Most annoyingly it's got ""OMADM"" installed (system app that can't be removed) and as far as I can see that would be for Sprint (American carrier). Every time you restart the device it's going to unsuccessfully try to register the device through OMADM and you'll be left with a notification you can't delete unless you go through a fairly involved process to force stop the application (which you will need to repeat every single time you restart the device). Secondly, about 60% of incoming calls don't connect (the caller hears a few beeps, call drops, does not forward to VM). I don't get a ton of calls so not a huge deal but certainly disappointed.",2021年9月22日 在加拿大审核

I had this phone 6 weeks when it starting turning itself off when I made or received a call.That's what a phone is for...making and receiving calls, right?Well I sent it to Nokia for repair.Post repair, it lasted 4 weeks and the same issue returned.I'm VERY disgusted with Nokia customer service and repair center and will never buy a Nokia cell phone again.(this was my review when I first got the phone in October) It's easy to use, functions are readily accessible.I got this phone to replace my Fusion, but to also replace my iPod...fewer devices.My only issue, so far, is you cannot set up playlists on the phone.So, I'll be doing that on my SD card, eventually.Windows needs an update for this problem as the SD music plays nicely, speakers are very good.That's my only complaint.I do very much like this phone, and would recommend it to a friend.I just found a Windows called CUSTOM PLAYLISTS.It was .99 and well worth every penny. I can make playlists on my phone with no problem.So, this is now a really terrific phone!! I'm very happy with it, and it is now 5 stars in my book.12/11/13...after 2 months this phone will not make or receive calls.It turns itself off when I try to answer a call.Have called Nokia and am to send it to be repaired.I'm so disappointed.....really liked the phone.Will see how long it takes to repair, and if that indeed fixes the problem.",2013年10月27日 在美国审核

"A great, inexpensive phone","It's not a flagship device.It doesn't have a front-facing camera. Reviewers say that it does not have the greatest display (it seems fine to me though, and I have other phones to compare it with). The battery life is a little on the short side. It feels a little light in your hand.But it's under $100 and it's a great phone.I have experienced no difficulties with this phone. The dual core processor is excellent. The touchscreen is very responsive. The animations are fast and smooth. Netflix streams well. The browser is great, rendering pages quickly and nicely. The audio sounds good through both of my sets of earphones, and the built-in speaker is loud. The wifi and data connections are stable.Oh, and Windows Phone 8 is a revelation. I'm so surprised by how nice it is. I have an android tablet, an iPhone 4 (from work), and an HP Pre 3 (with WebOS), and Windows Phone 8 compares nicely. In fact, I would say that it's the most elegant interface of all of them in terms of appearance (hats off to the typographers and designers). In terms of user interaction, Windows Phone 8 is more intuitive and less clunky than Android, about on par with iOS, and not quite as nice as the ill-fated WebOS. But I digress.Now for the really good stuff: if you're a Canadian like me, you can buy this phone from Amazon.com. Shipping is FAST. It took about a week.If you don't put a SIM card in the phone at first, you can still start it up. It complains that there's no SIM, you press ""OK"" or something like that (""Dismiss"" perhaps?) and on you go. If you put the phone in airplane mode, it won't repeat the SIM-missing message, and you can still toggle the wifi on and off. So you could just use this as a media/internet device, and not use the phone functions.The phone is carrier-locked to AT&amp;T. However, if you're outside the U.S. and you're somewhat technically inclined, this phone can be unlocked for a few dollars and used with a local cell service. Google and eBay are your friends. Do not unlock the phone yourself if you're an American, since it is illegal to do so in the U.S. AT&amp;T will unlock it for you (I can't tell if there's a service fee) after you've used the phone on their network for six months. [edit: apparently AT&amp;T has made the phone more difficult to unlock since I did it. Have a look at the forums on redflagdeals.com for more information]I highly recommend this phone. I don't think you can do better for the money.",2013年8月13日 在美国审核

Terrible.,"This phone is extremely bad, I bought it last week and not only does it turn on and off on its own at random times, but it also has glitches with the battery level. A few days after I bought it it crashed and I had to reset the whole system using the online Nokia Software Recovery Tool (which deleted all my data of course), after which it worked well for a single day and then crashed again, so that now it just won't turn on. The amount of time I wasted calling the customer service and trying to fix the phone was not worth the cheap price I paid (I probably spent more on phone calls to repair the phone than on the phone itself). I highly discourage purchasing this item in order to avoid frustration and waste of time.",2014年9月26日 在美国审核

You can't compare $199 contracted Galaxy S4 or iPhone 5 because you are stuck with a contract and must pay or companies come after you. I bought when it was $90 but at $100 it still can't be beat.You can't get an iPhone for $100 bucks and Android phones at this price range just plain suck.This baby is a dual core processor with 512mb of ram and it runs smooth. Windows phone might not have as many apps as android and iOS but it has quality apps that would satisfy most user (Pandora, Mobile office, Angry birds, Cut the rope, Netflix, Youtube, Hulu etc.) 97% of the apps on the other stores you would never use anyways.Best part I think is Nokia Here maps. Better than google maps as you can download maps for just about any country in the world with turn by turn navigation. Offline mode is available without the need for data which is a very big plus for me.IPS screen has very vivid colors although the resolution is not as high as most high end phones.Not like you can tell the difference on small screens.Screen is 4 inches and I think that is the right size.I have big hands or above average hand size and when I hold it with one hand my thumb can comfortably touch every part of the screen.The Galaxy S4 is about 4.8 inches I think and the Galaxy S3 is slighty smaller than that and my thumb can't touch the full screen without stretching.Camera is a 5MP snapper with autofocus and such.Basic camera and there are neat apps like PANORAMA, PHOTOBEAMER AND CREATIVE SUITE to edit your photos on the spot.Really nice that I don't have to go to the computer to edit them.Video is shot at 720p while most higher phones shoot at 1080p but its not like most people can tell the difference since both are HD.This phone will work for AT&amp;T MVNOS like H2o wireless, Red Pocket, Airvoice etc.I am using it with H2o wireless without unlocking.If you unlock then you can also use t mobile.I use this as my main phone and its great value.",2013年8月13日 在美国审核

Tried and sent it back,"I had been curious about the latest Windows phones. I am looking to move from the Android world as Google's latest version of Android is both more invasive (in terms of privacy) and really a step towards the mediocrity that often happens when management changes in the technology group responsible for the device. In this case, the stellar vision of Andy Rubin has been replaced by the more middle of the road corporate manager who shipped Chrome OS to the world. That's started to show in Android and thus, it is time to look at alternatives.As this phone was offered on a pre-holiday discount, I decided to take a risk and try it as opposed to joining the Apple side of the force.I was extremely disappointed. I found the tile based interface somewhat too constricting. Due to the unwanted AT&amp;T supplied crapware (one of these days carriers will realize that their business is to provide connectivity/bandwidth and leave apps and app-based services to those who know what they are doing), I wound up going through the settings to customize the phone. While there were some that were useful, some were just missing and thus I could not eliminate things I had no need for or no desire to pay the battery/bandwidth freight for.In the end, I simply powered off the phone and put it back in its packaging. There was absolutely nothing in the software that was in any way compelling at all. On top of that, the app store was a bit thin in terms of functionality. The final bit of missing functionality was tethering - always present in Android phones and an option for Apple phones. Without tethering, you really can use a phone if you have any other mobile devices you travel with that would benefit from WAN access.The 1 star is for the physical design: good form factor and fits in your hand well. Not so good on the buttons and battery though.Microsoft needs to pay more attention to users and less to carriers. I can see that they are trying to woo the carriers with all sorts of opportunity to add software from the carrier and brand it appropriately. The problem is, no one wants that software.I might have had a different experience if I'd received and unlocked Windows 8 device with pure Windows 8 on it (i.e like Android on a Nexus device from Google, or any iPhone with iOS).So, misses not just by miles but by parsecs.",2014年1月20日 在美国审核

Please no more Windows follies!,"I tried to like Windows… I preached that I would not fold to the I-cult, its inflated prices, and restricted permissions but with this phone and Windows 8 I’m done with the Windows ride. I have never seen a company set the standard then change it so drastically that is alienates its original supporters to the extent Microsoft has.Anyways this is my first Nokia phone and the build quality is great problem is the software. My biggest problem is that the phone has limited apps that work about 75% of the time and no flash for the camera. Bottom line is if you like the new windows format I’m sure this phone is a great match but my wife; who got a Windows 8 laptop in November and me, who got this phone in November have decided our 2 ½ month experiment was a mistake.

We went to the local Microsoft store for assistance, but their proposed fix didn't work and my son lost all his photos as well as several priceless videos he had taken at a concert. He was heartbroken and I felt like a cheapskate for having been too stingy to buy him a more reliable iPhone. The phone is completely non-functional at this point.

This phone is a steal,"I’ve been waiting for a phone like this for a long time – that is, a reasonably-priced, no-contract device that does not have to apologize on quality, performance, or style. I’m no technophobe (I work in an IT related field) but I’ll admit it, I’m a cheapskate. I’m not interested in putting a large amount of my paycheck towards a fancy phone or unlimited-everything contract. By managing my phone use and relying on wi-fi as much as possible, I can get all the calls, texts and cellular data I need for 10 bucks a month. The problem is, there hasn’t been a good selection of phones that give me the performance I want, at the price I’m willing to pay. That’s where the Nokia 520 comes in! I give it 5 stars not because it’s necessarily a perfect phone or OS, but because the value here is incredible. I can see why this is being snapped up all over the world. A lot of reviewers have commented that it’s a good “starter” smartphone, which it may be, but the only thing “starter” about it is the price. Sure, it doesn’t have the specs of a flagship phone and won’t appeal to everyone, but in my estimation it’s a very good phone that should be fine for most average users.After using the phone for a month, here’s a few specific thoughts:- I haven’t experienced any lagging, freezing, or need for restart – something that cannot be said for my previous phone which cost over twice as much.- I like the feel and responsiveness of the phone hardware. I have used other Nokias in the past and they have all been solid as a rock hardware-wise. I hope this does as well.- About the battery, with wi-fi discovery turned off and screen brightness set to auto, I typically have about one-half of the battery left at the end of the day. There was one day that some app or another (I’m guessing) drained the battery way down so I’m being more careful about what I leave open.- Camera so far is working well for me when the lighting conditions are decent. I use a real camera anyway for stuff I really care about. Plenty of options available for editing and uploading photos.- So far I like using the Windows Phone 8 OS. It was really easy to set up personal and work email accounts, etc. Navigating around is easy and kind of fun. I like all the info you can see right on the lock screen, let alone the home screen “live tiles.” The web browser has worked fine for what I need. I’ve adapted well to the onscreen keyboard and I’m becoming a big fan of the predictive text. I’m also using the voice commands more as I learn about the phone’s capabilities. Recently at a day at an amusement park, I used the voice command to speak and send texts back and forth with my wife, and it translated what I said great despite all the ambient noise. I understand some of the criticism of WP8 regarding some nuances and settings it would be nice to have. But here again, nothing for me has been a big deal and they seem to be listening to customers and adding improvements with each release.- Nice to have the free downloadable maps and turn-by-turn navigation. Works great with no data costs.- Availability of apps for Windows Phone has been a deal-breaker for some. Statistics show that most people REALLY only use a handful of apps and this is true for me. So far, I’ve found what I needed. (I’m a busy dad and mostly use my phone as a tool, not something I spend hours entertaining myself with.) A warning though, I’ve run into a couple apps and games that require a higher-powered phone, but nothing I really cared about.- It’s nice to have the Office apps on here so I can open docs I get from work, etc. I’m also getting into using OneNote.- The latest thing I’m loving is the Xbox Music Pass. Unlimited music downloads and/or online listening for a REALLY reasonable subscription price. I’m on a trial now but I think I’m gonna keep this one. Music is my one big weakness for spending money!To sum up, all I can say is, I think a lot of consumers (in the U.S., particularly) are hoodwinked into thinking they HAVE to have such and such phone on an expensive monthly contract. But if you’re like me and you have better things to do with your hard-earned money, then get this phone with a prepaid service and join me in laughing all the way to the bank!",2013年9月20日 在美国审核

"I can't stand Microsoft, they are the biggest copycats for everything and always late to the game, it seems lately on technology","I can't stand Microsoft, they are the biggest copy cats for everything and always late to the game, it seems lately on technology.I figured as much as I bad mouth them, I should at least try their stuff before doing so. I picked up a Surface Tablet and did not like it - interface was clunky and it didn't make a good tablet it my opinion.To me it felt more like an underpowered laptop with limited apps (this was the RT version not the pro so couldn't install regular windows programs).I figured for sure if I didn't like their tablets I certainly wouldn't like their windows phone.I have an iPhone that I am very pleased with, it's reliable and a solid performer and easy to use but I love to try out new gadgets.With this phone being so cheap I figured this would be a low cost risk in trying out a windows 8 phone.At a minimum so I could have credibility when I bash their products.So I got this phone, logged in with my credentials that I'm using with my Surface Tablet and I started exploring this phone.Let me say right off the bat, I'm not a fan of Windows 8 on a PC or Tablet - I hate the interface.But on this Lumia 520 phone, I'm in love with this Windows OS. I actually like it more than the interface on my iPhone.I don't know if I'm a little partial to it because it's new to me but the interface just seems right at home on this phone. After about a week of owning this phone I read that it could be updated to Windows 8.1 so I did that and the interface which I liked already is even better!I was really surprised I would like the OS but it works very smoothly, is intuitive and I am able to quickly navigate to stuff.Customizing is not very difficult and overall I found everything responsive.I felt that there were more than enough Apps at the Windows app store to get what I needed.While they may not have the exact same app as the Apple and Android stores have, there were some decent alternatives.The only Apps that I really miss are Dropbox and Clash of Clans, but eh guess you can't have it all.Also, transferring from iPhone to this Lumia was very easy.There is an app made by Microsoft called ""Transfer my Data"" and it is easy enough a kid can do it, just download launch the app on your Lumia and it tells you to turn on your iPhone Bluetooth, it then pairs the phone automatically and you push a button and in about 2 minutes it transferred all of my contacts - like magic.Only bad thing is it did not transfer my text messages, but all my contacts went through.Also, I was able to transfer all my iPhone pictures easily by using the SkyDrive app on both my iPhone and Lumia.The app syncs all your existing pics on the iPhone to the cloud automatically and then I could retrieve them on my Lumia.The phone itself has a solid feel to it, with a kind of rubberized textured back.The screen looks really good in my opinion and very clear.The Bluetooth works great with my speakers and headphones and the Wi-Fi works great although it does not see Wi-Fi signals over 5 GHz.I initially used this phone as an iTouch with Wi-Fi only and it is a great MP3 player and the radio and personal mix stations app loaded on the phone are free and very good.I also got a 64GB SD card and it played my movies and TV series with no problem (except a couple of times itgot stuck on a certain frame but the sound kept going - weird but closing and opening the video app again fixed it).You can still use skype but there is no front facing camera, also there is no flash.For the price, I understand not including those features but just understand those are missing.I now use it as a phone too but not with the AT&amp;T service.I had to get the phone unlocked.I called AT&amp;T and the nice Filipino ladies at customer service put in an unlock request for me and AT&amp;T emailed me a code in less than 48hrs from my request (it took a day and a half).Even though I didn't have my phone for the required 6 months, they unlocked it based on my circumstance so kudos to AT&amp;T service.BTW you must register the phone and get a phone number (it's all free) online before you can even think of requesting an unlock.It's a shame that it took Microsoft this long to get serious in the phone business, I don't know it might be too late for them to stake a claim in that market considering the maturity and dominance of Apple and Android.But let it be known, if Microsoft fails to get traction with their phones, it will not be because the Windows 8.1 interface lacks or is not polished.It is a very capable and effective interface and in my opinion user friendly and intuitive to use.Based on the price/performance ratio, I absolutely recommend this phone, even if you only plan to use it as an iTouch.While this is not the best smartphone in its class, I gave it 5-stars because it is in my opinion the best phone you can get for the price (new).For the $29 I paid and for the lightening deal of $19 it is now, this is a no-brainer and better than any mp3 player you can find for that price with the bonus of being a media player and phone.Just do it!",2014年12月21日 在美国审核

Not impressive,"It's a usable smartphone, and that's it. I previously used a iPhone4, and Lumia 520 does not impress me very much. In fact, after several weeks of using Lumia, I even missed my iPhone 4 even thought it is quite slow now.Advantage:1. low price no contract smartphone.2. expandable storage.3. Offline maps and navigation.4. transferring files between computer and the phone is easy and quick.5. Integrated with Skydrive.6. Microsoft Onenote app.7. Windows Phone OS runs smooth even though the ram is just 512 MB.Disadvantage1. poor phone camera. Do not pick this phone if you like to take photos using the smartphone.2. long wait of ""Resuming..."" screen when switching to another app.3. some hyperlinks are difficult to touch when surfing using the Internet Explorer. Sometimes I thought I touched the hyperlink, but nothing happened or even worse the other link is opened.4. voice volume can not set separately for phone itself and the earphone.5. calendar event reminder cannot set as ""remind me before 5 minute start"". Instead, it is more like a clock alarm setting, as it can only set as something like ""remind me after 5 minutes"".EDIT: I can set ""remind me before ... minutes or hours"" when I create the event or edit the event. But once the reminder is activated, I can only choose ""Snooze for ... minutes""; I cannot set it to ""remind me again before ... minutes"". Maybe I can re-edit the event to set it, but that's an awkward way.6. The search button on the bottom right corner is easy to be touched by mistakes. And there is no way to disable it or rebind it to other apps/functions instead of the seldom used Bing search.7. Awkward way to create a playlist through the phone. I cannot simply select the songs and save to a playlist. Instead I need to add the songs to the ""now playing"" queue first. But the ""now playing"" queue usually has songs which I played previously but do not want to save to the playlist. However, there is no obvious way to clear the queue until I google search the answer - play a single song which I want to save to the playlist and then add the other songs to the ""now playing"" queue.",2013年12月15日 在美国审核

I finally shortened the password on the router.For some reason I've never been able to determine, when not connected to wifi this thing is going out and doing something that shows on none of the menus that i have been able to find. In the six months I've owned the thing it has eaten up about $150 worth of usage on calls that I neither placed nor received.Most recently it will not connect to my wifi router.

Cheap Phone comes at a big cost. It's a lose-lose situation,"1. The phone is locked and ATT won't unlock it despite the fact that I've been with them for 7years.2. Google removed support for Microsoft's Exchange ActiveSync protocol for new devices in dec 2013. http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/14/3768274/google-gmail-activesync-windows-phone That means that you can't sync your contacts, gmail or your Google calendar to this phone. Google also announced that they won't be creating windows phone apps. So no gmail app. Syncing your emails is a pain and synching your contacts requires that you create a new account with hotmail, live or outlook. In other words, 5 extra steps. It's a lose-lose for people who buy this phone.3. Apps for this phone are very limited.4. Not a good phone to conduct business given restrictions with emails, contacts and calendar5. No front facing camera. So you cannot use Skype or do video conferences or take selfies...6. Battery life isn't great7. Phone powers off when it's in sleep mode8. Barely any memory which means you need an extra so card to save your pictures, videos, etc...Unless you are a die hard Microsoft customer (who ONLY uses tools such as outlook, hotmail etc...), this phone isn't for you. If you use any other products such as gmail, any Apple products/software or anything else... You are out of luck. Essentially you'll have to transfer everything over to Microsoft to get good use out of the phone.Perfect for grandparents who just want to make phone calls, are learning how to send text messages and want to take pics of their grandkids.UPDATE- camera does not have a flash or LED light...

Great off contract phone at a steal of a price.,"I had an iPhone 5 a year ago and then it got stolen. I can't afford to buy another iPhone because it is off contract with AT&amp;T and even the iPhone 4s would cost me over $350 off contract. I've been curious about Windows Phone 8 and thought this would be a good way to try it out. It is a Go Phone ( marketed for prepaid plans), but if you already have an AT&amp;T post paid phone plan, simply swap in your own SIM card and it will work right out of the box with your current phone number and plan (If you have a larger SIM card you can buy a SIM cutter for under $5 and it should work fine).I purchased this Nokia Lumia 520 phone from Amazon in mid-august 2013 (about 8 weeks ago). Anyways, I figured that for $100, I could try out WP8 operating system and if I didn't like it it would be not much of a risk or loss to me. So far, I have been really, really happy with it. It is pretty much equivalent in performance and specs to the iPhone 4s. With the Lumia 520, you lose the front camera and flash of the iPhone 4s, but you get a bigger 4-inch screen and bigger battery. The 520 only comes with 8 GB of storage, but I added a 16 GB SD card for a total of 24 gigabytes, which is more than enough for my purposes. Including the SD card, the total phone cost $115 (w/ free amazon prime shipping). I'd be satisfied with this phone if I paid $200 for it, but at $115 - I'm very happy indeed.The only shortcoming I can think of is there are not as many Windows Phone apps as there are for Android or Apple iOS, but I will not take any stars off of the phone because that is not an issue with the phone and there are more WP apps coming every day. If this was my first smartphone, there would be no complaints whatsoever. I know Apple and Android really have the smartphone market locked up in the US, Japan and UK, but I think Windows Phone will really get a foothold in EU and the developing world, so lots more WP apps should be coming down the pipeline soon form enterprising app developers internationally.My phone use is for texting first, camera second, phone calls third... fourth would be browsing the web while taking the bus to/from school, fifth as a music player and sixth for maps/directions. It does all of those things very well. The Nokia Camera app is great - I'm a photographer and I like that I can change the exposure by +- 2 stops, Nokia Here apps are awesome (maps, public transit and turn-by-tun driving)- the driving app even lets you download maps to your phone so you can get directions and view maps where there is no cell phone service (came very handy driving through the mountains in Western Nevada). The Nokia ""Transfer MY Data"" app was great and pulled all 300+ of my address book from an iPod Touch in about 20 seconds via bluetooth. I like the Windows Phone integration with SkyDrive and find it much easier to use and more user friendly than iCloud - there is a lot more customization options with SkyDrive whereas iCloud has a really dumbed down and simplistic interface over the web.I've even been able to do a small amount of data tethering with my iPod Touch. I've only had to do it once when I had no Windows Phone app for what I wanted to do. I've hear AT&amp;T locks out tethering from data plans unless you pay more, but I think it was only a small amount of data and since it went to a mobile device it was able to get thru the system. I think if I had tried to tether with a laptop, it might have been blocked. I wouldn't say this is a feature, and your mileage if you try this may vary.I really like this phone and for the price ($100), I LOVE IT! I think my next phone may be a Windows Phone with LTE and I may end up getting an iPad for those few iOS apps I can do without.",2013年10月11日 在美国审核

What a surprise in such a cheap package!,"Given the MSRP for this phone, you have to set some expectations. But then you realize it doesn't carry a 2-year agreement. You can use this phone out of the box on an AT&amp;T Prepaid (GoPhone) line or on AT&amp;T postpaid (contract) plans. It comes with a Micro SIM card and GoPhone activation kit in the box.It performs great! I've owned a Lumia 920, HTC 8x, Lumia 822, and a few older WP7 devices. This, just like any other Windows Phone, feels smooth and fluid throughout. Sometimes when a larger operation (filtering a photo, opening a big app) takes place, you will notice a ""Resuming..."" screen for a split second. Otherwise, it's every bit as smooth as any other Windows Phone. You can't really say that about an Android device at this price point.Pros1) Price! This phone can be used as a daily driver, backup phone, ""I dropped my other phone in the toilet and I'm not due for an upgrade"" phone, or even just a device you use with WiFi only.2) The software library for Windows Phone is getting there. It still doesn't have Instagram, but it has everything else you could really want.3) Comcast Xfinity remote lets me control my TV/DVR with this thing. It's like I got an amazing touch screen smart remote for free.4) First-party Xbox apps. Xbox Smartglass lets you use this as a makeshift Xbox 360 controller. Xbox Live lets you keep track of anything like achievements, recently played, your avatar, etc.5) Nokia Music lets you stream lots of music. FOR FREE!6) Nokia HERE (Maps, Drive) are awesome! You can download GPS maps for offline use. Use it in the car for turn-by-turn directions, or use it while you're out and about for mapping. If this was the only feature this device had, it would be worth the MSRP!7) You can swap the cover! If you get tired of the plain black color on this device, you can easily buy a colored variant from Nokia and just swap it out. The yellow one looks amazing!Cons1) There's no Front Facing Camera, so video calls are out.2) It only has 512MB of RAM, which limits some apps. I've noticed very few that haven't been able to install, and none of them are deal-breakers.3) The camera is 5MP, has no flash, and rather poor. But - it's still comparable or better than any Android device I've tested at this price point.4) The display isn't the best, but what can you expect for the price? It's crisp and readable at WVGA resolution, and the nature of Windows Phone really makes up for any other shortcomings the display may have. The colors are pretty good, considering it's an IPS panel.Note: I purchased this device directly from AT&amp;T at full MSRP + sales tax. Any of my comments are based on that price point, which is definitely the upper limit you will see for this device. This phone is already listed cheaper here on Amazon just 3 days after it was released.UPDATEThis phone (retail packaging from AT&amp;T) DOES come with a USB cable. I previously stated that it did not, which is incorrect.",2013年7月29日 在美国审核

"No support, no apps, no OneDrive.  Great phone for calls, texts and Wi-Fi.  Fairly good camera.","Everything that I have disclosed in this review of the 640 also applies to the 520 or any other windows 8 or windows 8.1 phone.They are great phones, just don't expect too much.(640 Review:I am a long-time user of Windows Phone and this was my favorite!!! However, I just want to say a few things for anyone considering it. If you only need to make calls and text or very light use of Office Products with no need for OneDrive, and you have good cell service and wi-fi, by all means get it. You won't be sorry. It also has a good camera. Just be aware there is absolutely no Microsoft support for it and almost no apps unless they are already installed and then they may not work, OneDrive for it is gone. I still own the phone and decided this week that I was going to trash the Windows 10 Lumia 950, which by the way is the most expensive phone I've ever purchased just to get Facebook messenger, as it is no longer available for the Lumia 640 or any Windows 8.1 phones. The Lumia 950 was made by Microsoft rather than Nokia and gets slower with every Windows 10 update, often won't wake up from sleep and regularly shuts itself down when fully charged, plus the new FB messenger takes 3-5 minutes to open. I have a part-time home in a rural area where there is no cell service, and neither of these phones support internet calls or text, nor is there an app such as Google Voice for them.",2018年5月5日 在美国审核
"Excellent phone for smart, frugal customers.","I rarely write reviews for Amazon, but this product has impressed me so much in my four months of ownership that I felt compelled to do so.Here are my reasons for loving this phone:-Incredibly inexpensive, especially when combined with the Straight Talk $45 plan and various discounts you can get on those cards.-Fast, smooth performance and excellent Windows Phone 8 interface just ""gets things done.""-Excellent Microsoft Exchange integration.-Good podcast directory, although fetching the latest podcast sometimes seems a little delayed.-GREAT sound quality from the headphone jack (I would describe myself as an audiophile).-Durable and replaceable casing.-Replaceable battery and SD card.-Solid IPS display.-Great battery life.-Excellent call quality, including the speakerphone.A few downsides:-Apps are still lacking in some areas, particularly an issue for me when it comes to medical apps.-Bing really is terrible, it simply cannot find the results you are looking for with the high performance of Google.I avoid the Bing integration and just go to Google.com in the browser.-Music should be drag-and-dropped from Windows Explorer.Windows Media Player syncs are unreliable.-Nokia Maps sometimes has outdated POI's, and it gives you too many voice commands so you are constantly being interrupted.For example if you are on the highway, it will sometimes tell you to ""keep left"" if you go by some random exit.-If you run the navigation app in the background, be aware that it may quit on you without warning.I missed an exit the first time I used this phone for navigation because of this weird issue.For example if you want to listen to music while running the navigation, you need to put the music in the background and put the navigation app in the foreground.If you leave the navigation in the background, the phone may close the process leaving you flying blind, unaware that you lost your GPS guidance.To conclude, I think it is utterly ridiculous that so many people happily pay $100/month and $200 up front (+/- activation fees) for fancy new smartphones when you can pay half or less with the excellent Lumia 520.Don't be a sucker.Get this phone.",2013年11月11日 在美国审核
You are getting what you pay for.,"EDIT, 26 January 2015: Since I wrote this review, the phone auto-updated to Windows 8.1. I've downloaded quite a few apps for this, and apparently they don't actually close when you hold down the Windows button and tap the 'X' symbol to close. This drags performance way down, although it could also be because I've loaded up much of the on-board phone memory. Still, at $30 now this is a steal of a smartphone.First off I'm not giving it 5 stars because it's not a ""blow-me-away"" type of product. I start at 3 as a base-line. Secondly I want to disclose that I was never a full-blown smartphone user. I text a little, listen to music a lot and make a few calls and if I need to use the internet I just go someplace there's Wi-fi.

Not a bad budget phone by any means,"I needed a replacement phone and I was pleasantly surprised to see this online.For $99, you get the basic experience of a Windows Phone minus the high CPU capability for games.This is fine if you have another gaming device or tablet, so for me, this was a no brainer.Windows Phone does what you need simply and without much hassle.Bluetooth works great and with Win8Phone, it plays the audio from your videos over bluetooth with no noticeable lag for me.Connection to Microsoft Exchange accounts is seemless (I've connected to my work Exchange server and my Office365 Exchange server with no problems).Calendar sync, email sync, and contacts sync works well also.This is not a super fast phone but I don't necessarily need that.I had a Nokia 820 and this is along those lines but just a little slower.I got used to it fairly quickly.One good thing about this phone is the micro SD card slot which takes a 64GB Micro SD card without blinking.No issues there.Built-in GPS navigation is provided with the HERE apps.Xbox music works fairly well also and if you need to sync the music with your PC, you can just copy the files onto your SD card by taking it out and putting it in your computer or just use ANY audio sync software (except for Zune) to do that.I use MediaMonkey which works out of the box since this uses regular MTP.Sound quality is fairly good and unlike other devices, this plays the absolutely superb WMA Pro 24-bit format (48kHz/44.1kHz only though with 2 channels, but still that's something) just like every other Microsoft music player (Zune).It can announce caller ID, incoming SMS, it has voice control also which is great for hands free SMS reading and replying to people.I used it once while driving with a bluetooth headset and didn't need to find the phone or push any buttons.My bluetooth headset was in my ear and I could hear the SMS text and reply back.It's not a published feature, but there is a setting on the phone to turn that on under Speech and Ease of Access in Settings.Still, compared to low priced Android phones, this one just works great.Sound quality is very decent for the price and for $99, Microsoft may have just found their niche market.Also, I used this not as a GoPhone with the prepaid SIM but I just took my old micro SIM from my Android phone and put it in.No extra setup required.:)All GoPhones can do that on AT&amp;T, so I wasn't surprised to find that out.",2013年10月5日 在美国审核
Died after 6 months; horrible customer service,"I bought this same phone 6 months ago from Wal-Mart.The phone had a nice camera that even let me get non-blurry action shots of swimming dolphins.One of the only negatives, originally, was that there was no setting or 3rd party app that would alert me to a missed call or text.I would like to keep it on vibrate, but you basically get one chance to feel the notification.Microsoft has received this complaint a lot on the Windows Phone website.Their solution is to just look at the phone regularly to see the stuff you missed.Recently, I needed to take the SIM card out.I had powered down the phone and then removed the battery.When I replaced the battery, the phone was frozen on a blinking plug with low battery screen (the battery was nearly full at the time).Hard and soft resets did not help.(This problem has been reported on the Internet) Microsoft had me send the phone for service.Today, I received a new, replacement phone with a letter that said the technicians found an issue that could not be repaired.When I put the original battery in, the new phone had the same problem!Obviously, the battery was bad.Over the next several hours, I called and chatted with Microsoft customer service.They sent me to an AT&amp;T store to try a new battery, but the store had none.After another call and a long chat, they admitted that they have no batteries.Unbelievable!I think they never tried to test the original phone with a new battery; they just replaced it instead.Yet it took them two weeks to even do that.I originally demanded that they send a new battery; once I found out that batteries were not available, I lost all confidence in the phone.What will happen 2 years from now at the end of a normal battery life?Will there be any replacements?Will the replacement battery only last 6 months?Who knows?Then something even more weird happened.I plugged in the phone without the SIM—it powered on and functioned normally (sans the ability to make calls).When I replaced the SIM, it was stuck on the same screen.To experiment, I put in an inactivated SIM, and the phone powered on normally.Thinking that somehow it was the SIM (which worked in other phones,by the way), I called AT&amp;T.The gave me a new micro SIM.That night, the phone worked normally, I updated the software, backed up the phone, and thought I had it all figured out.I left the phone to charge overnight, and then I kept in on the next day at work.Everything seemed to be working—I made calls, took pictures, etc.I turned off the phone when I got home, but there was a glitch.The first time I slid the off slider, the phone rebooted, so I had to turn it off again.Then about 3 hours later, I tried to turn on the phone again; nothing.When plugged in, it is back at the flashing plug and battery screen.This time, removing the SIM did not change anything.So I'm back to thinking this model has some inherent defect.While the phone was working, the battery seemed to be working, and the SIM was functional.I think the phone may not be powering off even though it looks like it is, which could exhaust the battery, and then for some reason will not recharge.Microsoft left a message for me, but when I tried to return the call, the number rings 2-3 times and then goes dead.Due to the technical problems and customer service problems, I would not recommend this phone at this time.",2015年2月13日 在美国审核
Great paired with a AT&amp;T Mobile Share Value plan and Windows Phone 8.1,"If you sign a AT&amp;T 2-yr agreement AT&amp;T charges $40/phone/mo to recover the cost of the phone you pick (as well as a one time activation fee of about $40). But if you bring you own phone, AT&amp;T charges you no more than $25/phone/mo (and you don't pay the activation fee). Over the course of two years that is a difference of at least $400/phone.And if you use a lot of the data, the monthly charge goes down to $15/phone/mo, so the difference is almost $650/phone!Bringing your own device is a god way to save money over time.The Lumia 520 is a great smartphone for the price, especially now that it can be upgraded to Windows Phone 8.1 for free.It fits easily in any pocket.

A Fantastic Budget Device,"This is a phone that really shines in its price category. For the price I've yet to see a phone that can beat it. As a developer this is how I got into developing for Windows Phone and if you are a student or hobbyist looking to take that path this is the test device for you.The screen on the phone is cheap, but for the price, that should be expected. You will be able to tell the difference between this and pricier Nokia's like the 1520 or 930. The blacks are lighter than you might expect for example and touching the screen is less smooth as well. Don't expect something amazing, but for a smartphone at this price you can't go wrong.If you are working somewhere that might damage your phone these are a great choice as well since replacing them isn't an issue. I have worked with people in this situation who are taking advantage of this very thing.Better still, this can replace tons of your tools. Need a bar code scanner? This is one of the cheapest available. Need a digital shopping list or mini e-reader? This can do that as well cheaper than any alternative. Need to get your kids a fun Camera? Again, this is your phone.This is the smartphone for people who either could use a smartphone but don't need the advanced games and high performance of a more expensive device or simply don't want to spent hundreds on a phone. If this is you, this is a phone you won't regret.Finally, while the app gap does exist, the 520 can run most apps on the app store smoothly. This is not something you would find on a similarly priced Android phone.Note: I own a 520, 521, 620, 925 and 1520 for comparison. I have also worked with iPhones and a number of Android phones. You will notice the difference between this and a high end device, but in the low end, this phone is king, queen, prince and princess.",2015年1月2日 在美国审核

So Far So Good with a Learning Curve,"Needed an inexpensive way to have minimal phone service while in Mexico (we normally use Tracfone which doesn't work in Mexico so we couldn't just upgrade an existing cell plan). Overall pleased with this, might possibly keep it after the trip and give up the old flip Tracfone.We went with the ten cents a minute plan (25 cents a minute while in Mexico). I tried to activate it online but some of the options were unclear and AT&amp;T didn't have the $100/one year ""card"" online. I first went to an AT&amp;T authorized store and the clerk couldn't help me very much. I was just trying to get a clear idea of what I would be getting for my money. The clerk just went to the website and started reading the same stuff I had just read.I then went to the official AT&amp;T store and the clerk there was very helpful and had us up and running in about 10 minutes. Even so, he had to refer to the website to confirm the costs while roaming in Mexico. This plan does not provide data service, which is what I wanted. We will usually have access to wifi in Mexico, I just wanted phone service.We had trouble with accidentally touching the voicemail icon and having to hear a longwinded robot voice keep prompting us for voicemail with no way to shut it up. Turns out we had applied a screen protector and it was blocking the proximity sensor, making the screen go dark. There was a little cutout to pop out of the screen protector but I had thought it was just there for some other model of phone. We even went to the AT&amp;T store a second time for help with this problem and this time the guy could not help us, had to figure it out on my own. When the proximity sensor was unblocked, the screen now stays live (if not at your ear) and provides the option to end the call.Overall, it's definitely an inexpensive introduction to smartphones and the cheapest way I found to have cell service in Mexico.",2014年8月14日 在美国审核
"Using it for entertainment, not as a phone.","I just took over ownership of this Nokia Lumia 520 Windows 8 Phone from a close friend that had used it as his cell phone. He had trouble with reception in his mobile home and used up a bunch of data before he realized there is a toggle to turn data off when not needed. Generally unhappy with his choice, he offered it to me and replaced it with a basic cell phone. I, on the other hand, was looking for an MP4 player with a decent screen, lots of storage capability and easily played converted MP4 movies. After spending months eyeballing and searching the web for such a critter, I found out that many smart phones have these attributes and don't require a phone service to operate. Wi-Fi is the key for activity outside the MP3 &amp; 4 functions! Since we have wireless in our house ... Bingo! Hot spots may also be helpful.As far as this device goes I couldn't imagine anything being so functional and enjoyable than what Nokia and Microsoft has offered! Every day for a week now I have tried everything I can think of to experiment with its capabilities and have yet to be disappointed.To start, the IPS screen is phenomenal. Of course it's small, but every movie, video, picture, even streamed Netflix, are all crystal clear. Haven't tried watching outside in bright sunlight because if I'm outside in bright sunlight I should be doing something other than watching movies. I've been able to read from a Kindle app I downloaded on it and email isn't a problem, though I use my actual Kindle for most reading (they out perform anything for reading).The sound volume took me by surprise when using it without ear buds or head phones. Does the job clearly. For quality listening though, the head phones were the best. Sometimes that matters, sometimes it doesn't, the choices are wide open though. No, it doesn't have a fancy equalizer and such, but have you noticed it doesn't cost hundreds of dollars to buy?The OS, Windows Phone 8 (WP8), gave me a challenge to work with as it was my first experience. I have W7 on my laptop and have been holding out going to this next version like so many others. Change for the sake of change without a need for change isn't my first choice. Knowing W8 was developed for the touch-screen industry I just didn't feel the need to change. Now that I have had time with this WP8, I'm liking it more and more. Very customizable. Because I can still be very visual, I miss the little pictures (icons) used for W7 and my android devices. However the tiles seem to keep things simplified and ""clean"" looking, so I can understand some of its attraction. The screen commands have been very stable and consistent. No jitters or jags. Zooms smoothly and is very fast to respond generally. Once in a while there may be a slight lag downloading, loading an unread Kindle book or some other task, but not troublesome in my opinion. The smoothness of all the transitions make it a pleasure to operate in.I'll also note, as have others, it is very easy to access the battery and sd card. Pay attention to the ""instructions"". Hold your fingernail on a top corner between the screen and back, then push in the middle of the back until it pops opens. When closing, be sure to stay away from the buttons! Jamming will occur.I guess the battery life is par for the coarse, but I tend to compare to my Toshiba Ultrabook and Kindle. They are both mega-hour lasters and shouldn't be used for comparison. I have watched 2 &amp; 3 hour movies and still had over 80% left (Wi-Fi off). On the good side it charges really fast, whether from the laptop usb or the wall charger, so with a little diligence I should stay in the clear of a dead device. I've heard of phones getting really hot but haven't noticed that during those long movies I've watched so far.All-in-all, I am really, really happy with this new tech-toy! May try it as a phone someday, but for now I'll be enjoying it's pocket/mobile entertainment qualities (maybe like an ipod?) that far exceeded all my expectations! And what a great value for the price. Or a Big Bang for the Buck! Hope your time is as rewarding as mine ... Thanks.(4-17-14 UPDATE) - Now that I've played with my Lumia 520 for a while I would like to throw some caution to you music lovers. The sound is still great for my needs but 2 issues have surfaced. On a minor scale, the ""sound"" (adjusts equalizer, etc.) found under ""settings"" is not functional on this model, though it and the Nokia website says it is. All you can do in advanced mode is silence the ringer if you turn it face down. No equalizer.On a major scale, songs will duplicate themselves both in menu and while playing. Even songs I love get old when heard 3-5 times in a row because of this malfunction, so multiply that by every song on some albums and you might agree that it is unnerving at best . My research with Nokia and MS support sites show no updates yet to fix this complaint that is well documented in many threads of Q&amp;A's. They also indicate it has nothing to do with the hardware, but seems inherent with the WP8 platform. Just thought I'd throw out a warning and save you 6+ hours of figuring out what went wrong. One fix for me was to remove the sd card, delete the songs/albums being repeated, then drag and drop the individual file/folder of music back in, not using the 'sync' in Media Player or the WP8 PC app. This means taking apart the phone, etc. each time and not a preferred way of doing business.Besides this glitch, I'm still loving my toy with it's decent battery life, clear screen and simple controls. BTW; I added a silicon skin for minor protection and it eliminated accidental activation of the power, volume and camera buttons. Guess I'm easily pleased ... Thanks.(5-17-14, another UPDATE) Two big changes have taken place.1) Because of the trouble with my music files I found an unusual solution. Check the WP website for the Windows App Developer app, apply for it, and then you'll qualify for the WP 8.1 web developer preview version. ""No going back"" they warn, if you choose this method. ""System warranties will be disqualified"" they also warn. But I took the chance. Over-all I spent nearly 3 hours with downloading updates via our slow dsl line, reformatting, re-doing some settings , etc., but glad I did. Look up the additions that are included with this new OS to see if you want to risk the early use of it. Eventually it will be publicly available for you patient people. It eliminated the file duplications on my music, some apps are working even better now and it allows 3 medium size tiles on your start screen of this phone. Not a game changer, but something I quickly took advantage of. There's more but I won't go there.2) I just found a phone service plan that will work perfectly for my limited mobile phone use. H2O wirelessnow. Amazon's FiestaCellPhones store offered the SIM starter pack for a penny (no shipping) and H2O has a pay-as-you-go plan for as low as $10 for 90 days service. It works out to $40/yr for 800 minutes or 400 mg of data. They use AT&amp;T towers throughout the country (supposedly) and as you may know, this Lumia 520 is sold with an AT&amp;T goPhone SIM card. Works Great! Same reception we had with our little goPhone with the addition of using this Wonderful Windows Phone and the Super Nokia apps. Now I'm even using it as a cell phone/smartphone too!

Not Ideal as a WiFi Phone,"I bought this phone primarily to use as a WiFi phone. This turned out to be a bad idea. The current apps are not ideal for this (Google Voice is a pain to use now that they have stopped third party apps, TextMe is a stripped down version of the Android app that cant even make calls, and I am unable to answer calls on UppTalk).Hardware:The camera is good, even without a flash.The speakers are good for listening to music and watching videos.The touchscreen is SUPER sensitive and can be used with gloves on.All the ports and buttons are in the right place.Operating System:Although I like the look and feel of Windows Phone 8.1, I have to mention that many users complain about the app availability. There aren't as many apps, and many of the apps are not as well-developed as their Android and iOS counterparts. That being said, the app choice is not really a downside in my opinion, most of what I need is available.Apps:Good overall, everything I need is there (camera filters and lenses, remote desktop apps, email, syncing with cloud, good internet browser, Skype, weather, and various tools (calculator, etc.). I haven't tried any games, but it looks like there are a lot available.Email - I was very happy with the built in email/accounts application on this phone. The secondary reason I got this phone was to stay in contact (through email) with my clients.Microsoft Office - This is my BIGGEST COMPLAINT about WP 8.1. Word, for example, is a stripped down mobile version that can't even track changes. Also, you cannot even use ""Word Online"" through outlook.com because the phone automatically opens your documents in the app. It's a shame that Microsoft Office works better on my 4 year old Android than on my new Windows Phone. This means that I cannot do a major part of my work (proofreading and editing) from my phone.AT&amp;T GoPhone Plans:AT&amp;T pre-paid plans might be right for some people, but coverage is sub-par in my area; so, any plan is not worth my money. The phone will make an emergency call if I need it to, even without a sim card in it. AT&amp;T just can not compete with free VOIP and Skype. I am in WiFi 90% of the time.",2014年9月29日 在美国审核
Proably the best phone deal for ATT!,"Look beyond the brand name and WIN 8 OS (not be hung up by IOS or Android) and this phone delivers all the goods for an unbelievably low price (got mine on cyber Monday for $50). Here's what you get - nice 4"" screen size with bright and responsive touchscreen (don't expect the super high resolution at this price but it is clear enough), camera, full function GPS with great FREE maps from Nokia (people don't realize it but Nokia is a well regarded maps provider), 8 GB built-in memory with microSD memory card slot for adding more capacity (I got a 32GB card with all my favorite music, pics, and video on it), good call quality and loud speaker, more than enough apps thru WIN 8 store (please, how many do you really need), mobile version of Office included.I'm very familiar with Android OS and my opinion is that Win 8 feels a lot more polished and, besides not having as many apps, runs fast and without any problems.If you're familiar with MS Zune multimedia player, this unit will look very familiar. I actually consider this the upgraded version of the discontinued Zune HD with a lot more functionality and at a lot lower cost. You can use this unit as a multimedia device WITHOUT having to sign up to any cellphone service - it doesn't need a sim card inserted to function as a Win 8 tablet.I upgraded from a basic phone and use this with the Go Phone plan with NO data plan (don't need it - there's so many wifi hotspots around now and this unit connects with no effort to internet on wifi).",2013年12月6日 在美国审核
Best Entry Smartphone. Period.,"I already own HTC 8X, my wife has Lumia 925. I got Lumia 520 (ATT) as a backup phone (just in case, if we lose or break our phones), since it was on sale for $59.00 with FREE Incipio case (+ FREE shipping). I didn't expect too much, but I knew that Windows Phone OS will be smooth on the low spec phones. But when I received it and used it for few days, I can only say, ""WOW."" This is the best entry smartphone - including all entry level Android phones. Now make no mistake, this is not a high end phone. But this is very capable entry phone for all your needs. You can read excellent online reviews for Lumia 520, so let me just mention few excellent qualities of Lumia 520:1. PRICE. As of now, Amazon sellls it for $54.99. That is incredibly cheap. Just to give you a comparison, Sansa Clip+ MP3 Player (8GB) is $49.00 in Amazon. But Lumia 520 does so much more than playing your music. It has Nokia maps, drive+, etc, you can browse the web, email, set calendar for your appointments. You can take pictures, you can call &amp; text. You can read ebooks, you can do MS Office (preloaded), and so much more. So for $54.99, you are getting a mini-computer at your disposal. At this price, it is bargain.2. WINDOWS PHONE OS. If you are used to WP OS, then you already know how smooth, simple, and useful it is. But if you are thinking about WP, then Lumia 520 is an excellent choice (if you don't mind its low spec) for you to try it out since it is so cheap, you will still experience buttery smooth OS that makes your life organized and entertained. Lumia 520 is preloaded with WP 8, but you can easily upgrade it to WP 8.1 and Lumia Black. Sure it is not as fast as high end WP (ie, Lumia 925, HTC 8X, etc), but it is decent. It is smooth. NOTE: If you want to sync with Windows Phone with your contact list, email, calendar, etc.., it is BEST to use Windows Live Mail (FREE email client from Microsoft). It will always sync with your desktop/laptop with your phone.3. FUNCTIONALITY: call is clear, speaker is loud enough, screen (IPS LCD) is bright &amp; clear, but it is finger print magnet (but this is greatly reduced by putting on screen protector - Illumishield product). Memory can be expanded by Micro SD card - where you can store: maps, music, pictures, apps, and documents. Bluetooth (version 4.0) works flawlessly. The screen is responsive even with the gloves on. No front facing camera, but I don't do selfie - so it doesn't matter.In sum, this is the best entry smartphone you can buy. You cannot beat this price with this much quality. I love this phone. you might too. Give it a chance.",2014年6月3日 在美国审核
Love that it reads my texts to me and I can reply by voice and it will send text of what I say!,"You can't beat the bang for the buck! Great phone with lots of options! Be careful not to activate the narrator (for the disabled) hard to turn off! Battery usage seems to be very quick. Ring tones - not much to choose from worth a darn but overall that doesn't really matter. Fast, love the personal assistant, and the voice technology works very well!========================================================================= My wife's review is above, I also bought the same phone because of the price and the need to upgrade.I'm giving it 1 star.Its been a very problematic phone that isn't user-friendly in the least, with an extremely confusing/cluttered menu set-up, and no easily accessible instructions on the phone, in the package, or on the nokia website. The only instructions available cover the 8.0 operating system on the phone when you get it....NOT the 8.1 update that happens as soon as you turn the phone on. So you're left to figure most everything out yourself, and there's a TON of hidden settings to try and find and make sense of just to get the necessary stuff to work right. I was on the phone with AT&amp;T for over an hour getting my wife's phone to work again after she accidentally turned the narrator for the blind on, which made the phone completely unusable.It also screwed up her e-mail contacts and has syncing issues that can only be fixed with a complete reset...which will erase everything on the phone including all her info/customizing etc....which she doesn't want to do and is just going to live with.Overall this phone has been a frustrating headache that I regret buying...its nice I paid so little tho (I wonder why its so cheap? lol)...the low price eases the frustration a lot. Its a glitchy phone with a Bluetooth that only works when it wants to (on both our phones), and is also very flimsy...get a case because the first light drop and its toast.I will be selling mine on Craigslist and getting an android shortly.",2014年8月14日 在美国审核
A super bargain,"OK, so it's not the latest and greatest Android phone. But it works surprisingly well, has great battery life and it does everything you need, more or less.I bought one for my wife for the ATT GoPhone plan. Paid 79 bucks and got a free month and figured it was a steal. Now I see you can get one for $29.00. My HTC One M7 died suddenly, as they're prone to do apparently, and I needed a phone, fast. I grabbed one of these, swapped in my SIM and I was in business. I'm liking it so much, I don't feel the need to get another Android phone yet and if I do, I'm certainly not going to spend multi-hundred dollars.You have to like the Windows system if you're getting into a Nokia. I'm not a Microsoft fan at all -- I'm a Google and open source guy -- but you can download the free Google search and it even has voice commands. I use Gmail and it sync'd with my account. I downloaded my contacts from the desktop and uploaded them in a CSV file and now I have all of them in the Nokia.I made it simple: I have the phone function, email, Google search, the built-in texting, built-in contacts and HERE maps, which are very good (you can download any map to use offline and save data charges). What else do you need? It takes semi-crummy photos, just like any other cell phone I've ever used. I deleted some of the apps and stripped it down to the basics.It even allows you to use a microSD card -- my HTC One did not. I like the phone function; somehow it knows when the other party hangs up and presents me with the contact form and a bunch of options to end the call and more. My HTC One didn't do that, I had to hit the screen on button again and then end the call.The built-in texting function/app is better than the Google system (my HTC One was the Google Edition).I'm not saying this is the greatest phone in the world that beats all others, just that for the price, it covers all the basics and does it really well. I'm kind of surprised Windows phones haven't done better in the marketplace, because I think in a lot of ways it's better than the ""wild west"" approach of Android, especially for someone who doesn't want to mess with the system.Bottom line: the Nokia 520 does way more than you'd expect for the money and I'd even say it's probably the best smartphone bargain of all time.P.S. One more thing I forgot, the 520 has an easily replaceable battery. My HTC One died and it's sealed shut (and doesn't have a microSD card) so it's toast. If the battery dies on the 520, it can be replaced in literally 15 seconds.",2015年2月6日 在美国审核
Amazed! Former iPhone and Android SuperPhone user,"My Nexus device was stolen last month and unable to recover it I switched to using my work iPhone as a primary device. The transition was abrupt but reasonable, iOS has a stockpile of apps. But because of iTunes lock, music and bluetooth just don't like iOS. I have been on the lookout for a new unlocked device and still with the pain of a new Nexus device, I didn't want to pay out again, until I saw this holiday deal.Keep in mind my expectations were very low, of all the review of Windows Mobile OS and the market reaction being mildly negative, but for $60 why not give it a shot. So I'm not expecting a retina screen, super fast GPU etc.I am blown away by this device. I can't say if it is WP8 or Lumia, but as a lover of UI and design, I am very impressed by the fluidity of the device, the seamless integration of apps etc.Big wins:- Google Voice integration. MetroTalk rocks. iPhone sucked at this.- Music, both Nokia MixRadio and Xbox Music are very very good. Makes up for what I missed from Google Play Music. The iOS app just didn't figure out offline syncing, it sucked my cellular data constantly.- Live tiles and shortcuts. I love this stuff, we all have favourite things we do within all of our apps, let me make dynamic shortcuts to them! Very very good. Now I have a live tile of movie showings in my area. Awesome!- UI. Much better than Android. Seamless power management. Nokia(or Microsoft) has done a lot with less hardware. Very impressed.- Phonebook integration and social integration is excellent. Nokia devices always did excellent at this. - Apparently office integration.. haven't tried it yet so I'll see..Some misses:- Misses apps like Stitcher, Aha and - Existing apps like Kindle need update love- IE is very fast and fluid, I give them kudos to that, but c'mon guys look at Chrome mobile. Need to catch up, and let me access all sorts of websitesUltimately.For $60 (compared to $400 for a Nexus 5). Very high value per $$.",2013年12月28日 在美国审核
surprising little phone,"I never would have thought I'd buy a windows mobile phone. I was an original iphone adopter and stuck with it for years of upgrades, then switched to Android with a HTC One X. Unfortunately, my HTC died on my 17 months into my contract. That left me trying to decide if I wanted to pay my ETF and switch carriers, or pay a hefty upgrade fee, or just get an el cheapo phone until something else came up (like the next Galaxy Nexus which may be offered at a cheap price). I went to my local AT&amp;T to see what the cheap options were and it was a pretty bad set of choices. Generic flip phones that are useful to just make calls (I need IM and web capability for work). And an android phone for $80 that was terrible, laggy and slow. And then there was this phone.I don't know how they do it. My only guess is that this phone is sold at a loss in an attempt to lure you to windows mobile. I can't fathom how they could build this phone and sell it for $100. No, it's not an amazing phone, but it's a darn good one especially for $100. None of the specs are top notch, obviously, but it works and it works well. It's responsive, fast and reasonably good looking. Replaceable battery and SD card slot? Most android phones aren't even doing that anymore. Oh hey, bluetooth AND 4G?!?!?! Woah baby.My only real gripes are with the OS. If this is your first smartphone you'll probably have no complaints. If, however, you're coming from Android or iOS, you'll notice the lack of apps in the app store. Yes the big things are there, but if you're heavily invested in google service you'll probably be disappointed. On the plus side, the native tools sync with google contacts, mail and calendar pretty darn well. But google music, maps, keep, etc? No sir (there are some apps that work ok-ish). Also compared to Android there are a distinct lack of web browsers (there are a few, but they all use the same IE engine it looks like, no firefox or chrome), alternate keyboards, mail clients, SMS clients, etc etc.But bottom line, for $99 it will get the job done and do it pretty well.",2013年9月25日 在美国审核
Excellent phone -- Value to Dollar Ratio = Amazing!,"I recently purchased this phone from the AT&amp;T Go Phone website for a mere $50 (refurbished). My previous Go Phone, an AT&amp;T Fusion 2 (Android OS) smart-phone was a great deal at $40 bucks, but its operation was somewhat sluggish, and I decided to take a chance with this Windows phone.The FEEL of the phone is much higher quality than you are going to get with other non-contract phones at this price-point. This is easily the nicest build of any model of Go Phone that I've put my hands on. The Nokia 520's hardware is powerful enough to run everything very smoothly; I was able to noticeably recognize its superiority over the Fusion 2 instantly. Nokia's ""Transfer My Data"" app was able to very easily import all of my contacts from my microSD card (I had previously exported all of my contact information to the SD card using the Android phone). Thus, I was up and running very quickly.Some more tidbits:-A problem that I've had with three previous Android phones was that the volume of my media files was consistently weak--this phone pumps the volume when you want it!-Many people (including myself) probably look at the Windows home screen and see a lot of junk. The things that you don't like can be easily unpinned or resized. It is not difficult to set up a home screen that will suit your desires.-Another problem I've had with ALL Android phones is that they come loaded with many junk apps that cannot be uninstalled. I was able to uninstall ALL junk apps from this Nokia Windows phone without any fuss, a MAJOR plus for me.For someone like myself, who primarily uses their cell-phone to text, read emails, listen to music, and browse the internet, I cannot observe anything wrong with this phone. The build quality is FANTASTIC for a $50 dollar phone and given the rapidity of obsolescence for any contemporary digital device, I cannot justify spending over $100 on a telephone. I have been an Android user for several years, and I still enjoy using that operating system on my tablet, for which I feel Android is better suited. When using my tablet, there are a number of apps (bit-torrents, comic book readers, game-system emulators, etc.) that are not available for this phone. For me, this is a non-issue. I don't care to do my reading, gaming, and other such activities on a tiny phone display. For the price, and for my purposes, this is currently the best (non-contract) phone that money can buy.",2014年3月11日 在美国审核
Really great phone,"After I broke my ZTE Warp phone Android (very good too) I decided to buy the Nokia 520 after reading the specs and reading all the reviews. This phone is really great and I am glad that I bought it.The only thing that I was worried about was the low RAM at 512mb but I took a chance with it because I knew I wouldn't use it for games. But the 512mb is plenty on this phone. The processor and dual core is great as my phone has never slowed down or froze up.I have a 4GB micro sd card in it but so far I haven't been in need to use it.The phone size itself is very good and not to wide. I like to have a good grip on the phone while its in my hand. I bought a case that has hand grips on the side of it.The rear camera is good but I rarely ever use it. There is no front facing camera. So I am limited there in Skype but its ok.The battery last a full day. I've never really pushed it to see how long it actually last bc I am always charging it at night when I sleep. At the end of the day with heavy wifi use, my phone still has 30% charge left.Wifi is good. I can only get speeds of 10mb and my other phone I could get 12mb but I can tell in the dropped speed.4G is fast.I've already received the Black Lumia update for it but I don't notice any difference in the phone or its functions.Now the service is provided with AT&amp;T but while in my house I only receive one bar on my signal but when I leave I get full bars. But I have never lost any connections.This is my first Windows 8 phone and I like it much better than the Android O.S and Apple.Now Apple and Android market store has a lot more apps than Windows store but all the apps that I use, Windows store had them. I do prefer Android apps over Windows because on my apps, the Android offered better features. But its still ok. I still like Windows better since the phone is locked down more and secure I don't get any viruses. Android was horrible because of the viruses and I had to install an antivirus protection like Comodo or Malwarebytes and I had to install tuneup cleaners too but not on the Windows 8 phone. I don't have to worry about that stuff :)",2014年2月10日 在美国审核
Use it as my mp3 player,"I was in the market after losing (sigh) yet again another iPod. I decided that I was not going to spend the money on another one. Not sure how I always lose those things. Before searching them I decided to look at cheap smartphones to purchase as an alternative when I stumbled upon this guy. Yes it has only 8gb of internal memory. Big deal, I have a $15 16gb micro sd card (which I've had for years) and now I have 28gb of memory, less the pre-installed hardware. The phone will allow you to use up to a 64gb memory card! Not only can I achieve the same thing with this as I could an iPod Touch, but I didn't have to spend half as much. Having been an iPhone owner since 2009 I'm not sure I could use this as my primary phone, but for an mp3 player I couldn't be happier, intact I enjoy it more than I ever did any iPod. Why is that? Mostly because of the queuing system, I can play a song and then queue the upcoming songs I want to play. While the Windows app store is lacking there is enough to satisfy when I have an internet connection at home or on the go. I especially like the Text Me app that allows me to text even without the sim card, so long as I have an internet connection. This is a good piece of hardware and assuming that you're new to smartphones, needing a backup phone, or just looking for an alternative mp3 player, this device will suit you just fine.Update:Since having used the 520 as my mp3 player for a handful of months I decided to give it a try as my primary phone as well. My old iPhone 4 was beginning to show it's age so I switched my SIM card over to the 520. It was an adjustment but I've been pretty happy with it so far. Every week I find myself missing my iPhone less and less.The Windows app store does not provide a lot of reasonable options when compared to what you can get on an iPhone. I have been pleasantly surprised however with the apps that I have discovered. There is at least a third party version for most of the apps I used on my iPhone. You aren't likely to find the newest released apps for iOS and Android on WP8. It takes a while for their developers to send them over to the Windows Store. However, once they do make it they seem to run as good or better than their iOS counter part. Anyone who has tried to use the official Facebook app on the iPhone knows how slow and painful of an experience it provides. This is not the case for the Windows Phone version, at least not in my experience. For apps that don't have official support I have to rely heavily on third party apps to make up for their absence. I have found many of them to be better than official versions I used on my iPhone. While WP8 provides many versions, in one form or another, of most of the popular apps do note that you shouldn't be surprised to find that some simply don't exist on the platform yet. An example of this would be Wunderlist.The call quality is great and being able to use the touch screen with gloves is a plus while winter lingers on. The phone provides a very minimalist UI so the experience is great for anyone looking for simplicity. The OneDrive cloud storage is great. I've installed it on my Mac and haven't looked back to Dropbox or iCloud since I started using this device as my everyday phone. You wouldn't think that in today's market you could find such a great phone for under $100. I spent 5 years with an iPhone and the only thing I miss is the app store. I can live without it though while Microsoft tries to grow theirs.",2014年1月18日 在美国审核
Great phone for the price!!!! Plenty of power... Terrible camera....,"This is a great phone if you need something cheap but loaded with features. Here are the things I like:PROS:1. It's fast and fluid. It just works.2. It's cheap! Can't beat the price3. The screen is nice and the feel of the phone is great.4. It has an offline GPS mode (but there is a slight problem with this...see CONS section)CONS:1. The GPS is only free for local use. If you try using the offline free GPS in another country it will ask you to pay for a licensing fee. That's what happened to me when crossing back and forth from Canada and the USA.2. There is no led light or camera flash on this device. Makes it useless to shoot pictures with at night.3. The keyboard is CRAP! It is seriously terrible... I find that many users like myself end up hitting the comma button repeatedly instead of the space bar. I swear I'm pressing the space bar, but the comma always registers. Also the accuracy of the keyboard is terrible. It makes for an unpleasant experience at times..... I'm not the only one with this issue, as several of my friends have the same problem.Conclusion:Overall, although there are many shortcomings with this phone, it is still good considering the price. I don't think you'd be disappointed with it considering what you get for for the price. But, don't expect perfection, as this phone does fall short in many aspects.",2014年5月7日 在美国审核
current lumia user...,"This phone is great especially since this is one of the lower end WP devices that actually receives the 8.1 Cyan update. There are actually 2 WP 8.1 updates but only a few models so far receive""Lumia Denim"" but from what I can tell, this handset still functions superbly with ""Lumia Cyan"". When I bought my Lumia 520 it was from WalMart and costed 60 USD plus taxes. That was in Feb 2014 and here we are one year later and I am still using it! I am writing this review on it right now. My screen has never had a cover and this thing has been put through the paces. Not a single ding, dent, or scratch on it and I have admittedly dropped it twice on tiled floor from hip level. Call quality is still just as crisp as it was on day one and speaker output is still excellent. The pictures of the display here on amazon do not do this phone enough justice. You can be guaranteed that the colors in the display are a lot brighter than shown here! The camera is indeed this devices biggest downfall. BUT Nokia usually ships their devices with a Carl Zeiss lens set and in order for this phone to be kept low cost, I am so glad they sacrificed from the cameras and not the hardware! The snapdragon chip is amazing! Mounted to the 1.2 ghz processor, just reading that description is not enough. Believe me, the games on this phone have no resolution trouble or lag even when they are on oneyear dated hardware. Since this phone is only the Cyan update, Cortana is still just beta. But she does everything as advertised by Microsoft and then some! The screen could have done with another .5 inch. Although unlike many android phones of this size, the keyboard on this handset is very accurate and designed just right for easy input. I love my Nokia Lumia and honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything! Windows OS is not as scary as most folks might say it is. It is designed to be simple rather than flashy and I love it that way! This OS gives you very premium options and customizations that low end android phones lack. 10 stars! 5 is not enough to score it accurately. So if you are looking for tough hardware with a fully featured OS then I highly recommend this phone for any purpose.",2015年1月23日 在美国审核
Really enjoying this steal for wi-fi use and att calling/texting!,"My first smartphone.I have a ATT family share plan.Trimming my current ATT SIM card to the size of the micro SIM included in package was very easy.For me ""eyeballing it"" was easier than using the template since the gold functioning rectangle is identical on both cards.I use all features with Wi-Fi, but I selected ""no data connection"" in my settings, and in using it for a few days it has not used any data.I'm using a microSD card for pic. storage and it offered for apps to go to the SD card, too.I am a desktop Windows 7 and iPad user.This isn't an iPhone, but I really love how easy it is for me to use.Texting and phone calls have been executed just as I hoped, too-easy!I paid 19.99 as a Gold Box deal for myself and father-before Christmas, still considering it at 29.99 for my husband and Mother-in-law to upgrade to.I like how the touch screen works, and my last phone came off locked and would call the last person I spoke with (butt dial-but in my purse, coat pocket, etc.)...this will not do this.I have to press side button to wake it up, then slide main screen to select to make calls.Also have it set so camera button will only activate camera when I want it to, it will not wake screen.Having fun with this.Has a Kid's Corner that one could let children use without having access to rest of phone functions.I have it set up, have not used this feature yet, though. Keypad for dialing numbers is very large, which my Dad will love. Enjoy!",2014年12月31日 在美国审核
GREAT money-saver phone that doesn't feel cheap!,"I ordered my phone from Walmart so that the Straight Talk SIM would arrive at the same time, but either way it's still the AT&amp;T GoPhone model. Despite answers in the comments, this phone WILL work with Straight Talk, on AT&amp;T's towers. All you have to do is buy the Straight Talk SIM, go through their instructions, and then change your APN settings. (Just google ""Nokia Lumia 520 Straight Talk APN"" for several guides.)Personally, I like Windows Phone the most out of the major Smart Phone OSs. It's not as open as Android, but much more customizeable than iOS. Plus, as someone who primarily uses Hotmail/Windows Live for their email and such, it just all seems so much more integrated with my personal needs. If you're not sure if you'll like Windows Phone or not, I suggest going to a store somewhere near you, such as Best Buy or Circuit City, and see if they have any WP phones on display to mess around with. Yourpreference in OS is a huge deal!As for the phone itself, it is very solidly built. The back is a very soft, matte black that doesn't show any fingerprints. It can be interchanged with other colored backs purchased on Amazon or eBay. The screen IS glass, but definitely not Gorilla Glass. I would still suggest picking up some screen protectors, which are relatively cheap. (I got a three-pack for around $6 on Amazon.) The only thing about the phone physically that I dislike is that the home button is on the side of the phone instead of the top. This just takes some getting used to, though, and isn't anything to really nitpick over. The phone is also a great balance of size and weight. It's not the lightest or thinnest phone, but it is light and somewhat thin. It feels great to hold, even with a bulky case on it.As for how it runs, it is one of the smoothest phones under $200USD that I've ever used. I recently had a Huawei Ascend Plus H881c which ran okay, but you would never have guessed that it was more than twice the price of this phone. The Lumia, in my experience, runs flawlessly, with very minimal lag. The only lag I have experienced was when I was initially downloading a LOT of apps onto the phone all at once. I'm very impressed with the load it can take. (My Huawei, on the other hand, would have a heart attack if I even had messaging and phone apps up at the same time.)In all, this phone is GREAT for someone who needs a cheap smart phone, or even just wants a backup phone incase they lose or break their main one. I do have one warning about this phone. Be VERY careful about shopping for cases, especially on Amazon. Many cases claim to fit the 520 and its sister phone, the 521. HOWEVER, the 521 is 4mm longer. Any case that says it will fit the 521 will be two big. Sadly, this limits the phone's case selection quite a bit. There's simply no good ""Otter Box"" knock off that will fit it properly. However, not everyone likes the big clunky cases, so it may or may not be an issue for you.",2014年5月15日 在美国审核
You get way way way way more then you pay for.,"To clarify i did not buy the phone from amazon and i bought it for about 60$ awhile back, but this phone is a lot of things for such a cheap package.it has a decent back facing camera(nothing to gloat about but does the job)it has HERE maps which is the best offline mapping system to date(on of the main reasons i bought it, very reliable)it has a very very simple layout for all apps which makes it nice for me who could care less about all the apps i want.its touch screen for the most part is very responsive and can sense you even with cloth between you( sometimes it can get buggy but nothing to bad)it has some features for camera lovers like the nokia creative studio and the panarama( also nokia cinemagraph if interested)it is quite small and id like to say thin but not thin like the iphone 6so, for such a cheap phone its got alot of bite! and its even very durable...trust menow for the bad:not much to say you get way way way way more then you pay for but...it does get sorta hot when using certain apps and IE(internet explorer) most likely because most of the phone size is because of the battery.the major issue is does have is its battery life, id say its probably pretty normal when compared to smartphones but unlock my older models (non smart phones) it is rather fast to die. id say about 8-12 hours without use and maybe 6-8 with decent use per day.(could be just my phone but i doubt)another final major issue is it doesnt have as big of a app base like apple or android so dont get it if your a app lover.(has a decent amount but if apps is your thing avoid this one)all in all i couldnt ask for any more form a phone because it gave me more then i even wanted or even paid for.",2015年3月11日 在美国审核
Windows Phone is... a Windows Phone,"The pros: It is cheap, it takes amazing pictures and has built in photo editing that has very cool effects.If you have no experience with Windows 8, you will with this device, hopefully Windows 8 will go rapidly (like millenium?? (remeber that OS)).Texting does not have swipe, so prepare to key in each and every letter.. however it does have really good voice recognition, although the context recognition is weird (deer vs dear).This is a small device, and did I mention that it is cheap (not cheaply built, cheap) THEREFORE dont worry about insurance, break it, drown it, replace itThe cons: this is windows 8 NOT windows 8.1, that is fixed in the 630/635 which will be released very soon. The 635 will not be as cheap, but it will not be a 600 phone (guessing 150 range) it has its own assistant (think apple siri (sp?)) it has swype.if you want to pack around a 5 inch screen in your pocket dont get this, if you want a cool CHEAP phone that once you figure out how to move the boxes (icons) around and resize them is very personalized.BECAUSE I am so not worried about damaging this phone I did not even invest in screen protector OR case, it fits in your pocket easily without making the gigantic bulge the minature tablet phones do.everyone else on here is talking about having paid 90, 100 or more for this... I got it for $48 (Amazon Daily Deal) with free shipping, and it was up and running within 30 minutesNo Contract, I can port my 14year phone number in, the downsides are minute for what you get!",2014年6月5日 在美国审核
This phone will take over,"I switched from android to Microsoft phone about a month ago now. Best thing that ever happened! I feel like with android phone I had 100+random applications by different people to accomplish what I want. They were all running with what seemed as their own agenda, I had tons of random files saved on my SD card from who know where,With Microsoft phone it seems to all be in one healthy and inter connected package. Things run amazing, I love the operating system of microsfot phone.The phone itself has exceeded my expectations, my camera is amazing, the voice recognition amazes my friends, I put it up to the competition with my co-workers iphone 5.If you use outlook.com for email and calendar, THERE IS NO BETTER SOLUTION.The reason I am most excited about this phone is because I can see the level of commitment that Microsoft is giving to make this the best smartphone available on the market, their goal is to beat competitors and amaze customers, which I feel like it has taken them some time to catch that vision, but now its here!",2013年11月26日 在美国审核
Little phone that's super capable,"This phone has a 4-inch IPS LCD screen and runs Windows Phone 8.1. Windows Phone OS, unlike Android, does not spy on its users.Many apps have icons called Live Tiles which can show additional information, so you don't have to open the app to see the essential info.Not all Live Tiles are useful, though, same situation with Windows 8. The developer has to make his or her Live Tile useful. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Bing Weather, Bing News, etc. all have super useful Live Tiles. The 520 has tons of features for this price. Two things that ARE missing are a front-facing camera, so Skype is not too useful here if you want to do video chat, and back camera flash. The 5MP camera works really well outdoors but can be grainy indoors, typical of medium-range phone cameras. After all, this is no Lumia 1020 or even 92x. The LCD screen is very nice, though, and the touch function works as well as on an iPhone which is to say the best!The large icons -- you have three sizes to choose from -- are super easy to read, a great break from the tiny icons on the iPhone and Android. A recent reports says over 70% of American adults suffer from eye fatigue due to using smartphones and tablets. I can tell you that after I started using Windows Phone my eyes have gotten less dry. The 520 makes clear calls. Like all Nokia phones, though, the vibrate function is a little lame. But I don't use vibrate at all, so it's not an issue for me at all.While the phone is the best smartphone for the price, AT&amp;T Wireless stinks, period. With smartphones, AT&amp;T does not allow you to add a pay-per-minute plan. You must choose a monthly plan, starting at 25 dollars per 30 days.T-Mobile is better in this regard, but AT&amp;T's network is 10 times better than T-Mobile's, so it's a trade-off I'm willing to accept.I use a Lumia 925 as my main AT&amp;T phone, but leave a 520 in my car as a backup phone and also my son carries a 520 to school. He loves it, too. Windows Phone has Kids Corner which limits the phone's functions, for instance it limits the maximum volume, and it's a great and reliable way, unlike a few Android offerings, for kids to use the phone.",2014年1月20日 在美国审核
I believe this to be the best value in technology of the year for smart phones!,For the money and value for the money this phone is very very hard to beat. Considering this phone is roughly the size of an iPhone three and does just about everything in iPhone three/fourS does and it's very very durable it's impossible to beat the value. I particularly like the fact that it has a separate button for the shutter on the camera and it also automatically adjust for the room lighting the phone will automatically them and it's just an overall fantastic product it makes calls and receive calls very well something some smart phones can't do. All I did was I purchased this phone for 30 bucks I took the miniature Sim card to my local AT&amp;T store they basically made that Sim card mine and I threw away my full size Sim card and never look back it's a great camera great price and just the right size of your eyesight is still pretty good.You will find out some maps are lacking for example and the apps might only be on android and iOS and they are you're up the creek but other than that this phone excels and every way shape and form. Besides it does have a reasonable amount to apps and this is coming from an iPhone 4 user. Imagine that the $30 you can step up and quality from an iPhone 4 and get this phone! Now that the phone has Crotona she smart witty and to the point and every bit as good as Siri and my Opinion.,2015年1月20日 在美国审核
It's not a Porsche!!,"Granted its not a Porsche but you have to remember that this is not the top of the line nokia and what would you expect for a$40-60 range phone? Its like comparing an iphone 4 to the iphone 5s in terms of speed.The top of the line nokia are way faster I would assume.the last time I checked, the chevy corvette is way faster than my chevy cobalt.They both have 4 wheels, an engine, windows, doors, etc.I've had a galaxy s4 (which at times can be sluggish), iphone 4, wife has the iphone 5 and I've been using the lumia 520 basically as a tablet/mp3/video player just to play around.the best part is the gps feature. I originally got it BF sale for $40 instead of buying a gps and it works great.I get the latest map updates without having to pay tomtom or garmin (yes they ""sell lifetime map updates"" but if you read the fine print only as long as the product is continued to be supported - so in theory they can stop support any day).All this without even activating the phone to pay for a data plan.I am debating about going from the iphone 4 to the lumia but may wait till the iphone 6 to see what any new things come up.there is one major flaw with the windows phone compared to iphone/android and this is the app store, but we all know that is a major issue.but if apps are not your thing, then for $40-60 (depending) its not a bad deal and not a bad phone, minus the front facing camera.",2014年7月8日 在美国审核
Amazing phone for the price!!!!!,"I wish I new you could use these for your ATT plan all of these years. I just thought Go Phones were Go phones...not able to be added to a plan. Until I saw this on special for $30 and read the reviews. Anyways... I got this for my daughters first Smartphone. She was already under contract on my plan with a non-smartphone. It was a simple upgrade to this one over the phone. This phone had a different sized SIM card which is why we had to call to activate it- otherwise you can simply switch out the SIM with your existing one and TA DA...new phone. Anyways, they switched her over (did not affect the length ofher contract in any way) and she popped in her micro SD card and starting using it instantly. She absoluted loves it. And honestly...it has many of the features my S5 and my husbands iphone has. It has battery saving mode....and all of the typical features. And I was really impressed with the interface. The feel of how it responds so fluidly is really nice. It is a little bulky, and little ""plastic cheap feeling""...but the screen is very clear and to just look at the and how it reacts...really gives you a feel of a much nicer phone.",2015年1月16日 在美国审核
Nice Product,"Hi, I bought the NOKIA 520 go phone as a replacement for my zune music player basically.My trusty zune music player finally died, I was considering buying an IPOD TOUCH, they are nice but also close to 400 bucks.I use ITUNES and the Windows Phone syncher to get podcasts and music on the nokia 520.This works great!.I heard that to activate this as a phone on ATT (on a regular ""non-GO phone account"") you are required to add a data plan.I dont know if thats true or not, I'l stop at the ATT store one day and find out for myself.So what I do is carry my no frills cell phone AND the nokia 520 with me wherever I go.My wife has an apple Iphone with data plan, so if we are out and about and need to access the internet we just use hers.So I cant really justify to myself the additional 30.00 per month for a data plan (for my own usage).Another neat use for the nokia 520 is to use it as a wifi device at home or while you are out and about (wifi is more and more prevalent in places like Starbucks, Mc Donalds, Sams Club etc.) App selection is notas varied as Android or Apple devices, but its getting there.The phone has a built in web browser that works great.Another nice feature is the ability to search bing using spoken search terms (like SIRI on apple iphone and the google search feature on android).Out of the box, the 8GB of built in memory goes quick, so I bought a 64 GB microSD memory card, now I can store tons of music and podcasts on the NOKIA 520!battery life is average, if you use the onboard gps, it seems like battery life is used up much quicker.but smartphones nowadays all have batteries that are used up fairly quickly because of the many features smartphones have.Thanks for reading my review.",2014年1月17日 在美国审核

Works with Google!,"I wanted a smart phone that could hold my texts and contact info and one I could conveniently check my emails on. If I could see a video clip from FB, that would have been a bonus but I usually don't have time for such luxuries. I have a Google account from school and I wanted to use MS Office to read files from my Google Drive as well as compose short emails and create/read my Google Calendar events. I must say that this phone does all that and the display is crispier than my HTC vivid that I lost last month. I have an AT&amp;T account but no data plan and I only use this phone with WiFi. I can access my Google drive, it syncs perfectly, I can access my Google mail and my Google Calendar, I could not ask for more! I did not need a lot of memory because I don't download music or movies and I do not play games (it apparently has Xbox games?) so I comment on those. However this is a GREAT phone for the price and as far as I am concerned better than iPhone or HTC vivid which I have owned in the past.

"The Nokia 520 ATT ""Go Phone"" is a KEEPER!","I usually write short reviews or don't take the time at all, but I am very impressed with the Nokia 520.Bought this phone on Cyber Week for $49.95 just to try out Windows 8since I am a Windows guy trying to unsuccessfully use Microsoft Office on IOS products.I just bought an ASUS T100 Tablet/Laptop and love the fact that it's windows 8 and that Ican do both business and entertainment on it, including iTunes, and iCloud.All of my computers are windows based, however I have an iPad and iPhonebecause I love how seamless they work together and the Retina screens. I have been using the iCloud control panelwith my windows devices for contacts and photos from my iPhone.The thing intriguing about this phone is the idea of reducing my monthly outlay on cell phones,tablet cellular data, and the list goes on.So far I have installed an H2O wireless micro SIM and activated with a $10.00 pay as you go, 5 cents/min.plan that will expire in 90 days. I turned off cellular data, and text messages are 5 cents ea.I'm not much of a text user and can use wifi for getting my email and web surfing.The rest of the phone was set up using my Windows account log in.This phone is meeting my long term goal of having an inexpensive to operate smart phone.I've been looking for a ""Go phone"" like this for years.This would also be perfect for my wife or anyone that only occasionally uses a cell phone.I have installed a 64GB SIM card with 17GB of music and Hangover 3 MP4 as a test movie.Even if you don't use this as a cell phone, it would make a great low cost iPod replacement.I have streamed Netflix, Hulu Plus, etc. and this screen is great!For whatever shortcomings others before me have mentioned, all of the pluses with this phone outweigh any negatives.I will probably buy another Nokia 520 for my wife and eventually cancel her expensive iPhone contract.BTW, online activation with H2O wireless was easy with this phone. You can order a micro SIM on Amazon for cheap price. I have not tried other carriers yet with this phone. Good Luck.....this is a keeper!",2013年12月8日 在美国审核
Pleasantly surprised,"Got this phone because I found it CHEAP.My phone was an old Razr and I LOVED that phone, however,it needed a new battery which cost MORE than I found this Nokia phone for.Needing to conserve money, I bought the phone since it was cheaper that day.Gotta say, I was SUPER surprised at how muchI like this phone.My son (the gadget guru in our family) said I was an idiot to not go android, BUT I'm an older professional woman who doesn't need (or want) all the apps that son needs for his job.Sound is good.I can hear and those on the other side of the line can hear me.That's a huge plus....I've tried phones with much higher price tags that are awful in this area.Texting is very easy even with the onscreen keyboard.Battery life is amazingly good for what I use it for.Days at a time instead of hours.It also seems to charge quickly compared to those my family uses.Photos are FANTASTIC on this thing.LOVE that feature and now I don't need to carry my camera when out on a research trip.It also has GPS in it that can work WITHOUT being connected to the 3G which is a nice touch.I don't always have to carry my GPS now.I was also pleasantly surprised at how easy this screen is to read.The colors can be altered to suit your preference and vision and it's large enough that I can read a text without my reading glasses if need be.The windows interface was quite simple for me to use.....much easier than my son's android, actually.My only complaint was that while decorating for an event recently, I had the phone in my back pocket so it was handy.During this day, it froze on me three times.It's never done it BEFORE that or SINCE that day.SO, I'm not sure what that was about, although I never keep it in a pocket.NOt sure if it got hot or whatever, but it did freeze up on me.Rebooting it fixed it, but I was concerned.It's not happened since, though, and has been a real workhorse for me.I""ve been a user for over 5 months now, and so far it's doing its job. I even have service in places I never have before, and living in rural America, you can imagine how important that is.I think it was a good purchase, especially for the price I paid.However, if you're really into the gadgets, you WILL be disappointed in the app offerings....didn't matter to me because what it DOES do is perfect for my lifestyle AND the call quality was really the important feature for me.",2013年10月1日 在美国审核
Good for a GoPhone,"For a GoPhone it's great. I lost my HTC One X so I bought this one to replace it until I can upgrade next year.I decided to try a Window's phone to see how I liked it. It's actually pretty fast while scrolling through the internet and I love the Nokia Music app.Speaker on it is pretty loud as well.The phone itself feels a little more cheaply made compared to contract phones, but I haven't had any issues with it breaking yet and I have even dropped it once and it was just fine.I wish the camera had a flash on it, but the pictures still come out ok, good enough in a pinch and I can't complain too much when I think about the price of the phone to start with. The interface is nice, but does take some exploring and getting use to if you have had a different os. That's part of the fun of exploring a new os though. Battery life is average and what you would expect with most smartphones.As far as the apps go, no it doesn't compare to Apple or Android.There aren't as many apps, the number of free apps is limited (although that means they are generally ad free), and there are a few that I use from the Android market that aren't on Window's so it may be a deal breaker for me when I go to upgrade my phone next year.Overall I'm glad that I made this choice for a GoPhone. It's pretty good for what it is and I'm happy to have it for at least the next year.",2013年10月19日 在美国审核
About as good as you'll get for a new sub $100 phone...,"So I've used almost every phone OS currently out (except the newest blackberry 10) and was stuck using an old Palm Pixi Plus on AT&amp;T as my nexus 4 phone screen cracked due to LG's poor manufacturing standards/quality. I figured I would either go back to an iphone, try another android device, or take my chances with windows phone 8. I have to say, initial opinion was fairly high. Nokia mostly makes a good quality phone. But as the days and weeks went on too many problems reared their ugly head. First things first:1. THE REAR BATTERY COVER- I currently have an incipio case covering my phone. Whenever the phone is in my pocket (by itself to avoid nicks and scratches) the back over separates and needs to be re-snapped together. This happens literally every time I walk around and the phone gets a little jostled. Very annoying!2. LACK OF APPS/POORLY CODED APPS- This has been addressed before, but seriously! I thought that Palm's app store was barren! Well microsoft does have more apps, but less that you'd actually want to bother downloading. There is just too much garbage in the store, and that's saying a lot coming from android! Not to mention, some apps you download can cause the phone to freeze, or worse yet, crash and reboot when launched. Where's the quality control?3. NO NATIVE YOUTUBE SUPPORT- This kinda falls in with the lack of apps above, but deserves it's own section because of how big and persistent youtube is. Granted, microsoft and google ARE working together to make something happen, but as of me writing this review, nothing yet. Unfortunately your only option is to watch youtube through a clunky mobile site through the web browser. Not acceptable for ANY smartphone in 2013!4. RANDOM FREEZES/SLOW TO OPEN PROGRAMS- This probably has a lot to do with the lack of RAM this phone has (512MB vs the usual 1GB and up). But seriously, I've used low end android devices (not including the nexus 4) and many iphones (from iphone 4 on back) that had 512MB of ram OR LESS and never had the clunky slowness that this phone has. Hell, my back up Palm pixi only has 256MB ram and a 600mhz single core processor and responds faster than this phone half the time.It has to be Poor optimization, as it is running a dual core processor, that shouldn't be a problem, but it is.5. UNRELIABLE BLUETOOTH/WIFI- This could be due to me keeping the phone in power saver mode alot, but I constantly lose connection to wifi(and I've tried using it at AT&amp;T hotspots, libraries, my home network, and friends home networks and it's always the same). It connects just fine but constantly kicks off after anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes after connecting. The bluetooth function also has trouble staying connected to a bluetooth speaker I have. Very spotty reliability.6. ISSUES WITH THE SD CARD- I have a decent sized music collection that I keep stored on a fast CLASS 6 8GB Micro SD card. There are about 2300 songs that I compressed down to 64kbps mono mp3 (cd quality mono to conserve space) so most files are 1-3MB depending on the length of the song. The integrated Xbox music app is basically unusable. Constant freezes and some of the slowest reaction times I've seen anywhere. It literally takes anywhere from 3 to 10 seconds to change a track. The built in Nokia music app is slightly better, but still chugs along slower than it should. This card was new and formatted by the phone and works flawlessly in my windows 7 desktop, but this phone takes forever to read off of it. I can only imagine that the uncompressed 8-12MB original files would take minutes to load up. There has to be some issue somewhere because I've never had similar issues with android phones that support additional SD storage like this.7. NO APP MANAGEMENT- This I will never understand. Every phone I have ever used has some way to easily close multiple apps, not so with windows phone 8. When you hold down the back arrow key all open windows/applications pop up so you can easily scan through what is open and logically you think you would be able to close apps from this screen but you can't. Microsoft actually expects you to mash the back key from the homescreen and ""back through"" every open app to close them. This is THE WORST implementation of app management that I have ever seen! Silly!So, those are the glaring issues. I will give credit to Nokia (besides the rear battery cover) that the phone is generally excellent in quality at this price point. The preinstalled nokia apps are probably the best apps available for this phone. I've really been enjoying nokia music plus and here maps/drive. The only thing that holds this phone back is the buggy, beta feeling windows phone 8. It's not like this is a brand new OS either. It's been out a few years and should be more polished than this. Before I get the pro-microsoft goon squad on me, please know that I am a microsoft fan... to a point. I own a 360, windows 7 desktop and laptop, hell, I still have my Zune HD and an old windows ce based phone floating around here somewhere! This is just not a good product. I like windows phone 8 better than the windows 8 OS because I feel that of all places, windows 8 and it's derivatives work best on touch screen devices like phones and tablets, but they have a long way to go before they can think of competing with google or apple. So realistically, can you find a better NEW phone for less than $100? Probably not (I've looked pretty extensively) but this phone is better as a second device or emergency phone until microsoft gets it's act together and actually improves it's mobile operating system. It's not nokia's fault this phone fails where it does, the hardware is generally very good, the OS, not so much...",2013年8月19日 在美国审核
Best Windows Phone for the Price,"This is a great phone. I have been fighting the ""smart phone"" thing for a long time. I was wrong. This is a amazing pocket device. It plugs into my windows 8 laptop and can transfer photos, music, etc. To get my old contacts list I downloaded a free nokia app called ""transfer my data"" it transferred all my contacts from my old ""not so smart"" phone to this one via bluetooth in less than a minute. This was after searching for a couple hours on ways to do it. The nokia apps are very easy to use. The advertised battery life is not what they say. I guess if the phone was in the standby mode it might be but so far I have had to charge it about once every 3 days. Still longer life than my old phone. It is Nokia quality at a really good price. I use ATT 500 minutes talk, unlimited text, 200mb data plan for $40/mo. Since it uses wifi and the only ""online"" stuff I do is at home the $60/mo plan was more than I need.

Best AT&amp;T Phone for the Price,"Edit 9/30/13:After having the phone for close to a month, I changed my rating from 4 to 5.Battery:Battery life is great when I am not playing with my phone and mainly talking on the phone, check emails/facebook/twitter/calendar. Playing games beyond Ruzzle or Words by Post will the battery drain quickly (like Halo.) If I charge it in the morning a normal workday I will have maybe have 30-40% left by the end of the night.Talk/Text/Pics:The size and shape of makes it great to talk for long periods of time 2-3hrs. Less awkward than talking on the S3. Typing on the screen is getting easier with less mistakes but also I don't usually need to type much since it knows what sequence of words I use. Again I don't take many pictures but most pictures look pretty good and have good color balance. Definitely decent enough to post on social networks. Nokia Smart Cam is a great app.Apps:From some of the reviews I read, I don't think many people research the phone before buying it. If you are invested in Apple's or Google's ecosystem, then you will be disappointed. It wouldn't be any different if you were going from an Iphone to an Android phone.Using app discovery programs helped find quality apps (App Social, myAppfree.) Haven't had an issue with the lack of apps yet. Wish there were more choices of web browser as IE covers about 80% of my needs. UC Browser has a lot of features but is very buggy. The calendar is okay but like IE covers about 80% my needs. Been using Simple Calendar to get the other 20%. Haven't had an issue with syncing with my wife's google calendar.Like the People's feed more and more as well as the ability to create groups. Weave RSS reader is awesome. MyShopi (shopping app, crossplatform) replaced One Note and while it doesn't sync, the develop told me that the next version will. Using Bing for search has been fine for me but a big negative is that searching on the phone is not tied to MS Bing Rewards.Don't know why MS doesn't advertise it voice capabilities but you can answer and sent text by voice and search by voice for example. Haven't done too much with it but will probably start digging into it more. Also can translate using Bing Translator by voice, text or using your camera.Before buying the phone see what apps you need first. Just go to [...] and run a search for the apps you use.Conclusion:Great phone. Wish I had a data counter but using *777*1# been working out okay for me. There are limitations to this phone just like a multitude of other phones. It is a $100 no contract phone. It does not have all the apps that iOS or Android has. This is a locked phone but can be unlocked (haven't done but plenty have -- search ""how to unlock lumia 520"".) I see this phone as a phone that cost 1/6 the price of a flagship phone with maybe 80% of the features. See this review for more info ([...]By the way, Airvoice has been great so far. Good customer service and unlimited talk/text $30 (100MB data), $40 (1GB data) or $60 (3GB data.)Original 8/9/13:I was looking for a phone to use with one of AT&amp;T MNVOs, Airvoice Wireless. I am OS agnostic since this would be my first smartphone. My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it is a great phone but I didn't want a contract or pay $600+ for a phone due to the nature of my job.Iphones new/used are expensive unless you get a very old version. Android phones less than $200 are flawed in one way or another (too slow, old version OS, bad battery life, etc.) Realistically only the Nexus 4 was acceptable to me.The Nokia Lumia 520 does most of what I need it to do. It had all the apps I needed except Out of Milk (I use One Note instead). The speakerphone works great, the call quality is good. Using the WP8 is much better than I read and is very easy to use and learn. So far every app/game I installed runs smooth. I really like how I can sync Facebook and twitter and get everything in one feed without installing either app.Battery life could be a little bit better but it does last all day and while I don't use a phone to take pictures but it doesn't have flash or a front facing camera to use for Skype.This phone or the 521 are the best phones for under $200 if they fit your requirements.Overall a great phone",2013年8月27日 在美国审核
Good but not flawless,"Honest review: Good but not flawless.I've had the phone for a little less than a week and for a $50 phone its pretty good.Features:- 5 megapixel camera on the back only. No front camera- The physical buttons are all on the right hand side of the phone. Volume on top, Power button in the middle, and camera button on the lower right.- There are 3 very touch sensitive buttons on the bottom. Back, Home, and Search.

(Its a bug that should be fixed but for now its still there)- The home button is on the right instead of on top of the phone which I find inconvenient- The apps are still not all there when compared to ios or android.

Best bugdet anything,"I don't understand why anyone would buy a 500 dollar phone when this thing is out there. If you have to play certain games, however, the windows apps are a few years behind Andriod and IOS. Also there is no NFC and only one camera with no flash (the no flash thing is the biggest minus in my book). But for the price, it's no comparison for me. I can buy this phone and a kick-ass windows tablet or lap top for the price of an Iphone 4. If you need the flash...just get a Lumina 620, it has the same exact specs as the 520, but with a front camera and a flash. In fact, the hardware is almost as good as an iphone 4, without the IOS and a lower resolution screen. But, they both have 1 ghz daul core processors (kind of), both have 512 mb ram, and if you get the 'cheap' iphone, they both have 8 gb internal storage. All the iphone has for it is it's design and it's advertisement is unmatched...but if you are not a sucker (or a photographer), this is a phone for you.

FACEBOOK USERS - DO NOT UPDATE TO WINDOWS PHONE 8.1,"This is my first personal phone (I'm 17), and I really enjoyed it at first. I understand that iPhones and Android have a better app store out there, but in reality I utilize don't more than a handful of apps. I have other ways of entertaining myself (PS3) and the basics are pretty much on Windows Store such as a match-3 game called Jewel^3 (which oddly crashes without internet) and even Trivia Crack. It also has Instagram, although it is in BETA and it is a bit slower, but for the $30 I paid for this phone I can't complain. I would have given this 5 stars if it had not been for the latest Windows Phone 8.1 update, which gave the phone a lot more problems than good (at least from my perspective). I would like to point out that I do use mobile devices often for Facebook messaging, since it is the main way I keep in touch with friends (Although not my own phone - this phone - anymore. I'll explain why later). When I first received the phone I was very pleasantly surprised that I no longer had to download any apps and Facebook couldn't invade my privacy - this was because Facebook was actually built into Windows Phone 8! In the ""Me"" title you could get notifications from Facebook and post updates. You could even go to the ""photos"" app and when you scrolled to a certain section it only showed photos that were recently uploaded to your news feed. How neat is that?! You could also message people directly from the ""messaging"" title - so Facebook messaging was built in too, alongside texting! I was very happy to see all of this.Then the update came after my first week of having it. For the first 5 minutes it seemed to be a great overhaul and the features were very promising. But now? Ugh... I'll go over the issues. (If some details are not right, I'm sorry but I only had a week to familiarize myself with Windows 8 OS.) - You're now forced to download the Facebook messenger app if you wanna send Facebook messages from your phone. That's right, for some reason Facebook has completely split itself from the OS and it now requires that you use their apps! The messenger app is reviewed by many Windows Phone users and they all say it takes between 30 minutes to an hour to update messages. At that point, I may as well just send a text and burn my money (I'm on the 10 cents a minute plan which costs 20 cents per text)!! - Battery life has dramatically decreased. Did they even test the OS on Nokia Lumia 520 and see this? I bet not. The battery used to go down probably around 10% during the night when it had Windows 8 (no battery saver). Now, with Battery Saver, it goes down a whopping 20%!! What the heck?! I also left my phone on my nightstand for a whole day, absolutely NO APPS RUNNING and it died on me from a 95%-100% charge when I came back to check on it. That is absolutely enraging.- The calender app is so confusing now! They made it much more jumbled than before. To to-do list is only to be seen from the options on the bottom. Not as convenient, for sure.- The AT&amp;T Address Book does not work properly with this OS and phone, under any circumstance. It worked just fine in Windows Phone 8 though. I guess I'll have to go on the website and put in the contacts manually now... kinda aggravating since I just wanted to hard reset back to Windows Phone 8 (it was worth a try, but IT DIDN'T WORK. Windows 8.1 is the new OS of my phone).- The battery life is already bad on my phone. Now they want me to turn on location services just to use Cortana? But location uses more battery!! I barely use Cortana because of this.Now, I will have to say that Windows Phone 8.1 might have some things that benefit you, so I will list what I have noticed for you to see if it is right.- Cotrana is much more useful than any other personal assistant. Cortana will actually put things on your phone (unlike Google now) and she will personalize results for you (unlike Siri who just soullessly googled EVERYTHING).- The notification center has 4 fast-action buttons. You can customize them to your liking.- The loading times are faster. It shuts down in 3 seconds compared to 10. It closes apps about a second faster. (My personal opinion, this is still totally not worth killing my battery for). That is about it for the improvements. Not much unless you'd really utilize Cortana and have extra batteries laying around.When you get Windows Phone 8.1, you can't go back. Trust me. I have tried. - Nokia for Retail (a reboot program I guess) has updated to 8.1 as the OS. - Nokia Care Center has done the same (a reprogramming program meant for ""flashing your phone"" - should probably Google that for a better definition than what I could give you). This was my last resort since it was a lengthy process. But alas, it's done. It's just done.Don't make the same mistake I did. And I'm sorry if I come off as bratty. Sure, it's nice to have a phone, and for $30 I should really not be complaining since I did get my money's worth, but when I know that Microsoft made a step far backwards and hindered the performance of my phone... that's just not cool.",2014年12月29日 在美国审核
Good Phone - Apps are another story,"I bought this phone as a replacement for an Optimus G with a cracked screen.When I first bought the Optimus in February 2013, I considered another Nokia Lumia Windows phone, but was hesitant to buy due to a lack of app variety.Still being under contract with a broken phone, I bought the 520 for around $60.I've had this phone for 3 months now, so I think I feel comfortable providing the pros and cons of this:Pros:1.I like the Windows interface.I think it is very user friendly on the front-end.Some settings are a pain to locate, but apps are all in an alphabetical list which you can jump through by letter.2.Text to speech works very well.The phone will read your text messages to you.You can also respond without touching the phone.The speech to text is also as good if not better than my experiences with Google's version.3.You can remove most of the bloatware that comes on the phone, including At&amp;t apps.Cons:1.Apps - I cannot stress this enough.There are apps available for the phone, but be prepared for outdated versions or apps with little or no support.Examples: Kik Messenger - The most current version available on the store was updated in April 2012.It is currently October 2014.Instagram is still in Beta.Youtube is iffy at best.Pinterest is pretty much non-existent.Many other apps aren't actually written by the original company but are instead alternate versions.2.Camera - It's just not good.3. Internet Explorer - It does not do a good job handling mobile versions of websites.Walmart and Tiger Direct for example, don't even appear as mobile versions.Conclusion:If you just need a replacement phone for talk, text, and email, this is a good choice.If you use a lot of social media and mobile web sites, I would suggest choosing something else.",2014年10月16日 在美国审核
You can't go wrong with this phone! I love it!,"Got this phone two weeks ago at the ATT store, and I love it. Super easy to set up and customize, Windows 8 works perfectly, and the size is just right. I like that you can change the home screen to pull up with you use most, and change the size, color and layout of the squares. No crashes, and size is small enough and lighter than any phone I've tried.We changed the notifications and programs running in the background to save on the battery, which can be a little low on power. The other nice thing is you can change the battery yourself! Unlike an iPhone.For $99 if it breaks, it is cheap enough to just get another one after the year warranty is up.Also loving the Go phone service. I switched from Verizon, and was worried about coverage. The map looked like it dropped off at my house, but it is actually better in many areas than the Verizon service was. I have the $25/month, and use wireless wherever I go, and mostly just wanted it for texting and voice, so I'm super happy with no contract and the service. Get it, you won't be disappointed!

It is a great GPS with Nokia Here (NAVTEQ) map support,"I purchased this when Amazon has it on sale.It was my first Windows phone, even though I have several Windows tablets, as well as Windows laptops that are running Windows 8.1.This is a low-end smart phone with a low-res screen and low-power CPU by today's standard.It does work well with my Office 365 mail box and it comes with a global coverage for Nokia Here (formerly NAVTEQ) maps and GPS apps, which support off-line maps.Even though I never put in the AT&amp;T SIM card, which will require a pre-paid plan, the phone received OTA updates through my Wi-Fi nevertheless, and was eventually updated to Windows 8.1 phone OS.I will not be using this as a cell phone as I do not want to pay AT&amp;T.Without the SIM card, it is still an excellent GPS device with global map access.It will also be able to connect to the Internet via my Android smartphone WiFi hotspot feature at no additional cost.I think you just can't beat the price (under $50) for a device like this.",2014年8月20日 在美国审核

Very Good Phone,"I purchased this phone to switch over from an android phone that was giving me plenty of problems and think that for the price it is a really good phone,it did take me a little getting used too but i actually prefer this to android phones.I have had no problems with the phone or with the service since i bought it and i think that anyone who wants a good phone without having to spend a lot of money should take this phone into consideration..I do however have to point out some negatives,the camera is only 5mp for me its fine but other people may prefer a phone with a beefier camera (Keep in mind that this is a budget windows phone) I also feel battery life could be better &amp; The windows store does not offer as many apps as the google play store...Other than these small complaints I am happy with my purchase &amp; love my windows phone.",2014年7月19日 在美国审核
Great entry to Windows Phone,"This is a great replacement for me considering that its predecessor was a ZTE Avail 2. My AT&amp;T contract is about to end, but I may end up using this with StraightTalk later. It'll be my first WP (I've dealt with Apple &amp; Android so far), and I've read great things about it even in comparison to Lumia 635 (which I may try next).

nokias are awesome!,"ive never written a review but i thought this one deserved it. my galaxy s2 bit the dust so i needed a new phone. this one is very good for the price. if youre expecting a top of the line phone you'd be mistaken to get this one. this is a basic smart phone and does it very well. its perfect for me because i dont think i even used those extra features with the gs2. the only thing i really want from a smart phone is internet browsing, netflix, youtube, a camera, adequate mp3 player functionality, and fb access. it handles all this very well and the os is very smooth. it only has 512 mb of ram but still works very well. sure when you open some apps it takes a couple seconds sometimesbut everything is still very fluid. also ive read that the 512 mb of ram limits or prevents some apps from being used, but all the ones i wanted are accessible. theres no flash for the camera but still takes decent photos with adequate lighting and can record 720 video. if you are expecting budget functionality you will be warmly pleased as it does this exceptionally well. also some people dont care but to me its a big deal this phone comes with a ton of ringtones, a bunch of nokia ones too and it reminds me of my first phone which was a nokia circa 2003. they have the best ringtones lol. thanks for reading!",2013年12月22日 在美国审核

Great phone if you don't need a lot of apps,"This phone is simply amazing with Windows Phone 8.1. It is fast and the included software are really good. Here are a few that I like:1. Cortana: personal assistant, almost as good as Iphone's Siri, and in some aspects, better. Very easy to set up reminder based on time and location. Cortana can even tell jokes and sing for you.2. Lumia Storyteller: very good photo viewer. It automatically group your photos based on date and create a slideshow for them.3. Here Maps, Here Drive: great GPS software, you can download maps for offline use also so no data connection is needed when navigating. Also a huge amount of languages available for voice.Overall this is a great phone to get if you only intend to use the included software and don't want to install other apps or games.

A very usable phone.,"My daughter broke her iPhone so I gave her mine and bought the Lumia 520 because it was inexpensive. I had little to no expectations for the phone. My thoughts were, if it makes calls, texts and does email it will help me survive until I can get another iPhone. Boy, was I nicely surprised by the quality and usability of the phone and Windows 8 OS.The best I can say is, it does everything I was using an iPhone for. Calling, texting, email, GPS turn by-by turn. All for a fraction of the cost of other phones. I recently upgraded to 8.1 with Cortana. Look out Siri! Now this phone has everything the ""big boys"" have for a quarter of the cost.Sorry Apple, I think I will switch to Windows Phone 8.1.",2014年8月7日 在美国审核
Incredible smartphone for the price!,"I have say, for a $48 phone this Nokia is INCREDIBLE. I happened to get it just 2 days ago after the 8.1 update was released for the Lumias. The software has been rock solid. The phone is very snappy with a responsive screen. In order to make the price so low, they had to leave out the front facing cam and use a lower quality screen. The hardware is very basic but doesn't feel cheap or plasticky, nice rubberized back too. As for the OS, it's well known that Windows Phone is missing many apps, but it does mostly all the basic apps that most people use daily. A huge downside is Internet Explorer, it renders a lot of pages terribly. And they don't make Firefox or Chrome for Windows Phone. Cortana is actually better than Siri and the GPS is cool because it downloads maps and doesn't require internet connection to use. Ultimately this is the best budget phone I have ever seen.",2014年8月28日 在美国审核
Great phone!,"It's a great phone! It's easy to use and learn. The only issue I had was the, ""Narrator,"" I opened the app and it took over the phone. I had to do a factory hard reset to get it to turn off. I lost some of my pics and data but now I'm learning how to back up my stuff in case it happens again. The narrator app litterally took over the phone and made it impossible to do anything. Maybe it was just a gliche or something with my particular phone but I will never use it again. This phone comes withCortana, and so farI like the app. It's nice to be able to just ask her to text or call someone for me. Although you have to push 2 buttons before she does that, it's still kinda cool. You can press on the windows and move them around and pin and unpin different things to the front screen. Also the accessories are cheap and easy to find on amazon.",2014年10月10日 在美国审核
The best low-budget device ever made,"This is an amazing phone for the price point. No iPhone is this cheap, not even old models like the 3Gs or 4- and no Android phones for the same price are this high-quality.The Lumia 520 is a superb budget device; it does have a few tradeoffs, such as the lack of a front-facing camera (no video chat). Also, this phone only packs 512MB of RAM, which means that some resource-intensive apps aren't available. I haven't noticed a major problem with my phone's app selection. The integrated apps such as Office are major value adds.The 520 is also one of the first Windows Phones to get the Lumia Cyan/Windows Phone 8.1 update, which adds a slew of features such as voice assistant Cortana (Yes, the Cortana from Halo), notification center, and tile backgrounds, to name a few. The performance is a little rough switching between apps (you'll see ""resuming..."" text a lot), but never anything that ruins the experience. Overall, this is an awesome phone. I highly recommend it.

I read a lot of great reviews about this phone and I couldn't pass it ...,"Update:Ive been using this phone for several months now and it still works great. The battery holds a charge and it's pretty much problem free. However, the more I use it, the more I HATE the Windows 8 operating system. Its not a knock on the phone. The phone is great. Its the terrible Windows 8 interface and the clunks apps that I hate.I recently jumped in the ocean with my iPhone in my pocket and ruined it, so I needed a replacement. I read a lot of great reviews about this phone and I couldn't pass it up for 50$. After a week of use, I was so impressed that I had to write a review.The good:This phone has a micro Sd slot so you can add more internal memory to the phone. I used an 8gb card and synced my Itunes playlists using the Windows app on my laptop. It worked perfect on the first try and loaded all my music onto the phone. I always hated the lack of storage space on my iPhone.You can load maps and use them offline, even if you don't have a data plan. I never signed up for a data plan and Google Maps is buggy on the iPhone unless its connected to the wireless network. This phone works perfect with turn-by-turn directions wihout a data plan. I was blown away that Nokia would include this feature for free. This is an awesome GPS.There is a much larger selection of free Apps from the Windows store now then when it was first launched. There are also a few websites on the internet where you can pirate free apps and test them out before you buy them. This phone is awesome because it allows you to sideload apps without jail-breaking it.The built-in camera for this phone is actually pretty decent. I think it's comparable to my old iPhone 3.I read some complaints about the screen quality, but I think the screen looks good. Its obviously not going to look like a 500$ Galaxy Phone, but it sure looks like a better screen than what you would expect n a 60$ phone.The phone looks nice. It really does. It looks like an expensive phone. No one will ever believe you bought it for 50$ without signing a contract. And that's the best part, all you have to do is pop in your old micro sim card and go through the basic setup yourself. You don't need to connect it to a computer and you don't need a tech to do it. Just pop the back off and pop in your sim.If I had to complain about anything, it would be the lack of compatibility with android apps. But I have the same complaint with my iPhone. I would love the ability to play android apps on my Windows phone.

Best phone for the price!,"I got this phone for $99 last September for my main phone. I use Net10 unlimited data, text, and talk plan.

Reformed android user,"This phone competes with a Samsung Galaxy S3 performance wise.I found this hard to believe because the specs on hardware are no where near that of the most popular android phones.The operating system has much less lag and glitches compared to android.One of the reasons is windows standardizes everything.This helps make a more uniform experience and causes less conflicting OS issues.Windows also requires a hardware min requirement for the phones.This model has the bare min of 512 MB so you won't be able to run all the apps but most of them.The screen of this phone is the same as the high and much more expensive 600 series.The screen (turned on brightest in settings) performs well in outdoor sunlight.The speaker lets you turn on the music and enjoy a very high quality.The phone also comes with a ton of standard apps which save money and come as a nice package.I would check with friends who use ATT on the 4G HSPA+ network ( Not LTE!) before buying.The area I live in does not have their backhaul capability.So they said I would get 15 meg downloads...

"Nice phone, but awkward keyboard","I just bought this phone and basically, it's good and also my first Smart phone. I figured out how to use it in no time whatsoever. What I like best is how easy it is to create an address book and then to make calls or send texts. What I don't like is that the letters on the keyboard in this phone are just too small and too close to one another so that I always type the wrong letter and constantly have to correct. What makes this somewhat easier though, is the auto recognition of words that appear, so that I can select the word, rather than type it in its entirety.Also, the proximity of the letters only allow for the use of one hand to text. The number keys are situated much better, are larger and easier to use. I don't know why Nokia couldn't have done the same with the letter keys.Voices are not quite as crystal clear as they used to be in older Nokia phones, but I think I can live with this.When turning on the phone, it seems to take quite a while until the main display screen appears. There's no physical manual that comes with this phone, so you have to look things up on line, which is an annoyance.There doesn't appear to be a data plan for this AT&amp;T Go Phone unless you change your plan, however, AT&amp;T does offer data on a pay per use at 1 cent per 5 kb. I find the battery life to be poor because even if you don't use the phone, the battery dies.Creating a microsoft account on the phone comes with its own difficulties and frustrations.You have to type letters that appear so they don't think you're a ""robot"" trying to create an account, and no matter how many types you repeat this procedure, it fails.The volume keeps going down, and I constantly have to remember to check it and make sure it's on high.

Honest Assesment,"With so many mixed reviews about this phone that had me youtube a vid on it, I'll be frank about this phone. Maybe my review can help others who may be in debate about buying one. I like this phone so far, like it a lot. Not once has it dropped a call on me, screen is crystal clear and touch screen highly responsive. It is roughly about the size of a Samsung Galaxy S2, maybe just a small shade smaller, but about 9/10 the same size.It uses the micro-sim card, so if you're upgrading phones and have an old one, you're gonna have to contact AT&amp;T about keeping your number. I wanted a new number anyway since I was moving to another state, so it suited me fine. The windows 8 OS takes some getting used to, but it's not too difficult. It plays my music and my videos with no issues at all, I haven't checked all of the apps available for it yet, so I can't comment on those. I'm not a big app person, but if you'd like a nice phone that won't break your budget, and you mainly use it for talking/movies/music, I'd highly recommend this phone. If you like mad apps, voice activated email, access to government satellites so you can monitor your house, then this may not be the phone for you. I say 'may not' because I haven't checked out all of the apps.Many may comment that the buttons pop out, and that the 520 is frail....find me a touch screen phone that is not. As long as you don't rough-house this phone, drop in the toilet, drop it period, basic common sense with all touchscreen phones, you'll have no issues with the Nokia 520. Get a case for it, get a screen protector. Both of these can be purchased here on Amazon, or you can go to Walmart, they are both very inexpensive.Overall, this is a very good phone, depending on what you use you phone for, and it is worth every penny spent.

Same as Nokia Lumia 521 for T-Mobile,"My 5 star rating applies to the Nokia Lumia 521, which is virtually the same phone.Potential customers should be aware that this same phone is available as the Lumia T-Mobile 521, which is also for sale at Amazon.com. It is an excellent phone - all of it's good points have been summarized in other reviewers comments.However, T-Mobile offers a $30.00 prepaid plan that gives the user unlimited texting and data (1st 5 GB at 4G non LTE), and 100 minutes for talking. I don't think that the AT&amp;T prepaid plan offers anything close to that. Yes, the 521 costs $20.00 or so more, but you can make that up in the first month.Also, looking at AT&amp;T's website, I do not see any mention on Wi-Fi calling, which T-Mobile includes on the phone. This comes in handy in areas where the cellular service is weak, especially in the owner's home. You still pay for the calls, but the quality of the service is far better.Potential buyers should also check with AT&amp;T to see if the phone has been updated with the latest GDR-2 update, and if not, whether they plan to release the update, and when. T-Mobile has already released the update for the Lumia 521.Just a few facts that potential buyers should be aware of before buying.",2013年9月22日 在美国审核

Nothing can come close for the price,"I've had this phone for about 6 months now, I got it just at the end of January. When I got it, my intention was to try this phone out to see when I get an upgrade (and a data plan more than just pictures) if I would like to get a Windows Phone or and Android. I was a bit skeptical going in, because of the very low specs compared to higher end phones. However, do not let these mediocre looking specs fool you- this phone performs amazing!When I first got the phone, it was pre-loaded with wp8. This was a fast, fluid, and virtually lag-free experience. After coming from an android dud (Samsung Rugby Smart) it was like a breath of fresh air. This seemingly low power processor was able to keep the phone running smoothly and quickly, with the only sign of its disadvantages being in the camera area. But I'll talk about that later. As for the wp8 OS, I really liked how modern and interesting it was. It didn't resemble iOS or Android, which was nice. I found that most the apps I wanted are found on the app store, but not as immediately as on other operating system's app stores. The apps generally move quickly, but I don't like the vine app. The videos don't loop smoothly and it gets pretty annoying. Some apps are exactly like the Android version while some look like a Windows Phone app... so while this app store is young the apps are varying in design which gets annoying. Also, because of the limited RAM this phone can't download some apps.The phone will always go back to home if it gets frozen for any reason, so don't worry about the phone locking up and never working. I like the vibrations every time you hit the 3 touch keys, but if you don't like it, it can be turned off. All the hardware buttons are on the right side, with the volume rocker, lock button, and camera. I like the dual click camera button for focusing then taking the picture. On the front of the phone you have the 3 touch buttons, a mic, speaker grille, light and proximity sensor. The back of the phone contains the 5 megapixel camera and the loudspeaker. The bottom has a micro-usb charging port and top has a 3.5mm headphone jack.I find the camera to be fine, but I've never had a phone with a camera above 5 megapixels to say how it compares to higher res phones. There's no flash, so low light has left a lot to be desired. The microphone is incredibly impressive for the type of phone it is. I went to a rock concert and the audio (not so much video) was great, a good amount of bass and everything could be heard clearly. My friend took a video on his iPod Touch 5 and I think mine came out much better. There is no front camera on this phone.The phone will sometimes restart, it gets pretty annoying because it's not like you know if you do something that'll make it restart, it just does it whenever it feels like. Don't let that turn you off though, becuase it rarely does it for me.The screen shows text somewhat clear, but with the low pixel density text gets pixelated and pictures/videos don't come out crystal clear, but you must keep in mind the price range that this device is competing in. The screen is hard to read in direct sunlight, setting the screen brightness to auto can make this more manageable however.Loudspeaker is louder than my friend's s3, but of course at highest volume it's not amazing sounding. For calls it is very good though.I updated it to wp8.1 early using the Preview for Developers app, and that operating system fills in a lot of holes that are missing in wp8. If you're considering getting something else because of this, I suggest you try updating to 8.1 first, as this makes the phone much more easily usable and updates the OS to have more modern features.For a $60 phone, there is really nothing else I can think of that can even compete with this. While the device may seem lacking, it is incredibly fluid for what it has to offer, and is a great glimpse of what Windows Phone is. With many pros and only a few cons, this phone is tough to beat!",2014年7月1日 在美国审核
Amazing phone for price,"I got one off of another site for 80$ - wish I had seen the 60$ deal here on Amazon - but even for the 80 dollars, this phone was a steal.While I call this phone ""Amazing for the price"" don't read that in the wrong way: This is an great phone all together - made amazing by the fact that you can pick this up off contract for so cheap.The Windows Phone UI is fantastic, integration with Facebook is the best on any platform, and it is FAST, I would say even faster than the top of the line Andriod phones like the Samsung Galaxys.The biggest complaint people have about it is that there aren't as many apps as iOS or Android but most popular apps have versions on Windows Phone that are just made by 3rd parties (and in some cases are even better than the official versions) - such as 6 tag for Instagram, 6sec for Vine, myTube for YouTube.",2014年1月4日 在美国审核
Few flaws...,"The last phone I had was an Avail, which was an android. So this is my first Windows phone. The software may not be as flexible or have as much apps and personalization as an android. But it does have more than enough needed. Plus its fast, compact, has decent battery life, and looks pretty beautiful to the eye. I really like it. However I have a few complaints. The biggest one; the back to phone hardly stays on. And yes it was this way brand new. But if you get a hard case it solves this problem for the most part. Also the buttons are so deep that sometimes its annoying, but it does prevent accidental button mashes. Its definitely a good phone, but for the price?....ITS AMAZING.",2014年5月3日 在美国审核
Constant resets and power-offs right out of the box.  Flawed design.,"I jumped on a Gold Box deal for this 520, as I was interested in trying out Windows Phone, and possibly having a cheap GSM smartphone for trips abroad.Sadly, mine powers off constantly.I finally managed to get it updated to Windows Phone 8.1, but just picking the phone up will cause it to shut down.A quick web search revealed that I'm far from the first person to have this problem, as it appears to be a common issue due to a poorly designed battery compartment, so it's being returned to Amazon, as the online process choked every time I asked it to send me a replacement.If you get a good one, it's a decent little budget smartphone, sadly I didn't get a good one.",2014年10月28日 在美国审核
DO NOT cut up your old sim card!!!,"This phone works fine with my carrier PureTalk. However, my sim card from my old phone was too big for this phone. I followed the advice from one of the reviewers who said to cut up the old sim card to make it fit. This was very bad advice as it ruined the sim and I lost all my contacts. So do not cut up the old sim. Instead simply ask your GSM carrier to provide you with a microSim card. Once PureTalk sent me mine, I put it in and the phone works nicely - love it! The down side is that now everyone in my family wants one :-) Also highly recommend PureTalk as the carrier - very reasonable rates, and works with AT&amp;T phones like this Nokia 520.",2013年10月25日 在美国审核
Fantastic phone for a great price!,"I got two of these for the kids last month. One of them I won't activate and will just use as a wi-fi connected music and app player until my son gets older. The other one will be the first smartphone for one of our teens. The quality of this phone can't be matched for the price. I have an xbox music pass and can download 10 free songs every month, which I give to the kids. The app store is growing quickly and I haven't missed any apps. I added a 64gb micro sd card to each phone which give it pretty much unlimited photo and music storage. Nokia music is a great music service and you can download the music channels on wifi so that they don't use any data. There's also Nokia Drive for navigation and lots and lots of exclusive Nokia apps. A great starter phone for kids and adults at very low cost.",2013年10月5日 在美国审核
3 1/2 actually,"OK, I've had my phone (from AT&amp;T) for almost three weeks. So this is what I found.Calls - very good with occasional dropped calls prob bec of my location.

Receiving a call also takes getting used to.Vibrate - Yup, it's quite annoying. no way to turn them offCamera - Now this one actually is pretty fair. You have to have excellent lighting, and you have to have the steadiest hand in the world so that therewill be no motion blurr. I have used apple products in the same situation with much better result. the camera button is unpredictable and tap to take pics is unreliable.Apps - definitely limitedAudio - really loud.

unbelievable value,"This is actually a very good phone.I bought this phone as a testing device for Microsoft's 8.1 phone software, which I was able to load without issue.(Google or Bingle it).It's snappy, durable, light and the battery lasts twice as long as my Galaxy.I can get 24 hours + on a single charge.The OS lets you customize the interface to a degree that will make most gagety people happy, and of course it integrates well with the microsoft universe of services like One Drive, and outlook.com.It also works on Straight Talk.I just ordered their nano sim, put it in, and went to the online account management site to transfer my number.Some good news is that it's 4G, and also has great WiFi reception.Software plusses include excellent navigation and the maps app even lets you download maps for any or all of the 50 states via WiFi ahead of time, making them available for offline navigation as well as not burdening the cellular networks as you travel.Cortana is their virtual assistant, which seems to anticipate when you are headed home at the end of the day, subtly displaying drive times, and other information.Expect that eerie feature to get more accurate over time.Drawbacks are related to the software, and many users that are married to android devices will be faced with the absence of gmail, google drive, and many other products when they go looking for familiar apps to install. Of course email from all providers is both available and simple to set up.In time I expect more apps to show up, as developers recognize windows phone as a viable platform.One last consideration is that this phone has only one camera.It's quite good, and meets the standards of mainstream phones, but if you want to skype or take a non-contortionist selfie, you're going to be disappointed.Remember though, this is a sub $60 phone, and considering that very attractive feature, the Lumia 520 is an incredible value.Edit-You should feel no regret in ignoring the negative reviews about this phone posted by people that bought it thinking they were going to unlock it and couldn't, or can't get android apps on it. This phone delivers well on what it promises, and no sub $100 Android phones could compare to it.",2014年6月15日 在美国审核
Very good value,"The hardware and software are on par with iPhone 4S. Does not have LTE data, only 3G, which is no big deal. The interface is fast and smooth, very pleasant. The screen is very good.Nokia has a FREE navigation app HERE which is very good and works without 3G, in contrast to Google Maps. The camera is also very good, with autofocus, but no flash.I would not recommend using it with AT&amp;T contract, since AT&amp;T will detect it and add $15 to your plan for using a smartphone. AT&amp;T prepaid (=GoPhone) is also expensive compared to ANY OTHER WAY of using a cell phone is USA. H2O and Straight Talk are AT&amp;T resellers (=MVNOs), and are much more reasonable.This phone body may be used with H2O and Straight Talk without unlocking, which since November 2013 is very expensive. H2O gives you unlimited talk and text + 50MB data for $30.00/month. Straight Talk gives you the same deal, but with 100 MB data. If you exceed you data consumption, you can buy more or just switch off 3G and use WiFi only. You can also buy minutes from them, if $30/month seems too high for you.",2013年12月19日 在美国审核

I check the weather, the stock market, my email (does not quite sync with my Yahoo account, deleted mail still shows up on my desktop computer), and- most important- I can finally text my kids without pushing a tiny button three times to create one letter.

"Good functional phone, but it has its issues.","I really love this phone. I've had a flip phone, a QWERTY keyboard Blackberry-type phone, and an Android smartphone. This is probably the best of the lot, easily accessible, really good photo and sound quality (both of which the Android lacked, even though it was $50 more).Issues: it breaks very, very easily. I dropped it, in a solid protective case, on the carpeted floor of my dorm room and the screen shattered despite the phone falling back-side-up. Apparently that messed it up pretty badly, because I am unable to ""end"" phone calls - the screen goes black and doesn't respond when making a phone call.(Which makes angrily hanging up on someone just not possible. My mother is delighted that I can't furiously hang up on her any more. Curse you, Nokia!)Limited accessories - good-quality cases are hard to find, as are screen protectors.The power button has basically fallen off - I know that wasn't due to the fall, as it seems that's a common issue with this phone.I don't have a contract with AT&amp;T so I'm just going to buy a new type of this phone, get a more expensive case, and find some way to not drop it.",2014年1月30日 在美国审核

Great phone. Great (and cheaper) iPod Touch Alternative.,"I'm locked into an android phone at the moment and bought this to use a media player. I have an old iPod touch which I liked but screen is cracked, I also have a Samsung Galaxy Player 4 which I liked only ok so when I heard great things about this and with the price being under $100 on sale I decided to try it.I added a 32GB SD card full of music and cost less than half what an iTouch would cost me and about $60 less than what I paid for the Galaxy Player 4. The nokia form factor is great. Quality seems great. Weight is nice. Feels great in my hand. Buttons don't feel like they'll break after prolonged usage. Very pleased aesthetically. In the online photos and based on the price I worriedit might be a cheap plasticky thing but it is truly much better than that. Screen is bigger than an iTouch, seems clear with great resolution.If you wish to use one of these as just a media player/wi-fi device simply start the phone and ignore the initial requests during initialization to activate the phone. Then connect with wifi for the OS updates and to connect to the store, download your some apps transfer some MP3s and you're ready to roll. Was very easy to figure out and use.Although the Windows store is a little hard to search through. I searched MLB but found nothing official. I thought Baseball had ignored the Win 8 platform. Later on randomly I came across the official MLB ""At Bat"" app. So it was there all along just hard to search for. And funny thing is the At Bat app for Windows phone is much better than what I have on my android phone.I do like Instagram and am eagerly awaiting the official release. Netflix app works great. Watched some shows on phone with no problem at all. Nokia music app was very easy and smooth. As good as any other online radio system imo. You can pay money for a version with additional control over it.Watching videos on the phone worked great, no hiccups. But I am unhappy with the lack of a scrubber bar. On the built in internet browser it takes about two more steps/clicks than on an android or iphone to switch tabs. Not a deal breaker but wish they would streamline that part of the user experience.Really love this device and I will definitely be buying a Nokia phone whenever my android dies.",2013年8月26日 在美国审核

Love this phone,"I'm a big 'no contract' person, and I've been a Tracfone and net10 user since I first got a cell phone over 12 years ago. Recently I decided to upgrade to a smartphone and I bought the Net10 ZTE Illustra. HUGE mistake. That thing only had like 150 MB of internal memory, so when I took it out of the packaging, it downloaded updates and was immediately full. It wouldn't let me transfer anything to the memory card either. I returned that sucker immediately and bought this. Though I hate Windows 8 for a computer, it's fantastic for a phone or tablet. This phone is absolutely wonderful. There are a couple of drawbacks which aren't a huge problem for me but might be for someone else (there's no front-facing camera, there isn't a huge choice of apps - can't get goodreads, can only get Instagram Beta, can't get my local newststation's weather app, etc.). What really drew me to this phone was that it clearly stated on the package that it has 8 GB of internal memory and is upgradeable to 64 GB via microSD card. The screen is vivid, the phone easy to use. I could tell immediately that this phone was better than the other 'smart phones' offered by no-contract companies because of the heft of it.

I had to go to an AT&amp;T retail location and all they could do for me was port my phone number to a new sim card so that I could at least use the new phone. I do not know why AT&amp;T would not clearly indicate that the phone's sim card may not match, instead of saying all we have to do is put our old sim card in the new phone and everything works fine.

Fix the battery leads and enjoy.,"I am writing this review strictly to refute the negative things put out about this phone.There are only two problems that i have with this phone: the first is that the battery leads are about 1mm too high. In the event that you grip the phone tightly and push against the rear cover, the battery will lose its connection and turn off the phone. To fix this simply bend the leads down, and they will maintain a constant connection.The second issue is the lack of a built in compass, initially i was unsure how this would effect day to day use. Basically what it boils down to is that the phone has GPS so it can tell you where you are, but without a compass it cant give you turn by turn directions. In fact most apps will simply quit when the navigation icon is clicked.Aside from these two things the phone is amazing for the price, if someone told me two years ago that I could buy a dual core smart phone from a retailer for $85 including tax I would've called them a liar. But it sits in front of me with the clearest and loudest call quality of any phone I've owned, with a bright decent sized IPS screen, from one of the few hardware vendors I trust.Don't hesitate.Just buy it.",2013年10月21日 在美国审核

Be very careful with the glass screen,"Purchased the Nokia Lumina 520 from Microsoft and put it together as soon as it arrived.Surfed the internet on my home broadband a little so as to get used to the Lumina 520.I was impressed so far!Later I had the time to do the activation with AT&amp;T so I could make calls.Unfortunately the screen had a crack in it by then and the Lumina 520 would not take any input...the touchscreen function was lost and along with that there was then no way to use the Lumina 520.I was told simply by Nokia that the crack on the screen voided any warranty.Microsoft was unreachable.I never got the chance to see how it would perform as an actual telephone.My suggestion would be that, if you can, get one of the versions that has gorilla glass, this one does not. But if the glass holds up it will be a bargain, that processor impressed me with the speed at which everything operated.",2013年8月22日 在美国审核

Just read until the end (you'll better understand),"Okay, the phone in general (on windows 8 and 8.1) is amazing! However, the buttons fail to function properly under a year! But, for windows 8 user volume control can be claimed (for free) from the store and use the double tap feature to turn on your phone (if the power button stops working. This is how i was living with this phone. However the windows 8.1 update came and screwed it up a little. Because of the volume changes you basically cannot access volume if your buttons do not work and there is no app for 8.1 as an alternative. So as a temporary phone with the $40 prepaid plan this phone will be best fitted. For long term usage.....not so much. Also, i just figured i would go back to windows 8 but 8.1 has a better variety of apps, games, and nice backgrounds. So i like it. The seller who is selling this product i'm giving YOU 5 stars but not the phone. I did not buy the phone from this seller, but just wanted to warn people of upgrading for 8 to 8.1 and button control",2014年8月8日 在美国审核

Nice price ok phone.,So an upgrade with 8.1 and a bump up in star as ATT has let Microsoft leave in data sense. Phone works good on ATT gophone network even without a data package.The phone it self is really good. Depending on use I get all day out of it (unplugged 7am plugged in at 9pm). The app store has a wide range and growing number of apps. It is more of an exception now not to find a windows phone version of an app.The power button stopped functioning had to downgrade. The app market is decent but nifty integration with other systems continues to lag behind (windows phone issue). Next phone will be an android.,2014年5月12日 在美国审核
Here Maps,"I purchased yesterday, and loved it. According to the price, it is amazing. There are lots of perfect reviews, so I don`t mention about the phone in detail. Here is my comments;- Unfortunately, offline navigation (turn-by-turn direction) is only free for the U.S. You can not use offline voice navigation in Canada or Europe. In order to do that free, you have to upgrade the operating system to windows 8.1. And, the win 8.1 update has not released yet for Lumia 520 black. But if you need earlier, using a Microsoft developer account, you can upgrade to Windows 8.1, easily (search for google).- If you have time (unfortunately I could not wait), you could wait for Lumia 635 for 99$, with quad core processor and 4,5"" screen. But still without front face camera and still has 512 Mb Ram :(",2014年6月24日 在美国审核

Quick Review: An all around excellent device,"I purchased this phone a few days ago at Walmart for about $67, and this is my perspective on the phone.I'm switching from a Verizon Galaxy Nexus to this phone through GoPhone. As a long time Android user, I figured I would purchase this phone and a Moto G, but I'm not even giving serious consideration to the Moto G anymore. I think modern Android is fantastic, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good the Lumia 520 was. Read on for my full review.My absolute rating for this device is a 4.5/5.Camera:When using the camera, you will find it to be better than expected. The low light performance is some of the best I've personally seen out of a smartphone camera, but you will encounter weird demosaicing issues that result in color banding sometimes. Overall, the camera is hit or miss. It can easily produce blurry, undefined photos, but if you hold it steady, you can get some very nice photos out of it. The shutter speeds just seems slow, which explains all of this except the occasional demosaic issue in low light. This camera is remarkable for a $70 phone and good for any affordable phone. The two stage shutter key is a nice touch, even if it is a bit mushy.Display:It may not be 720p, but it is still very nice. If you tilt the phone back so that you're looking at it with the bottom closer to your face than the top, you'll see a distinctive band of bright pixels at the top, but otherwise the display shows no light bleed or distinctive off angle discoloration. Saturation and primarily brightness suffer a bit when viewed off-angle, but color seems to stay fairly accurate.Battery:The battery life is excellent. If I stay connected to WiFi all day, I typically end each day with nearly 40% battery remaining. If I keep WiFi turned off, I'm still able to end the day with at least 25% left. ""Day"" here is defined as a 14 hour time span starting when the phone is removed from the charger. I have no complaints in this regard. The battery is removable as well. Obviously keeping the display on all day will make the battery life shorter, but know that it is easy to make it through a full day.Performance:Excellent. I have no issue multitasking, and the device is pleasant to use. Even Halo: Spartan Assault runs beautifully. Sometimes, Halo: Spartan Assault would hiccup for a moment right after loading a map, but it doesn't happen consistently, and it isn't noticeable unless you're really paying attention. Web browsing is very smooth, texting is a breeze with the ultrafast touchscreen keyboard built into Windows Phone.Call quality:Overall, no complaints here. It makes phone calls, and the calls are usually clear. The audio was muddy during one phone call, but it could be due to any number of external factors. Most calls sounded good, and I had no dropped calls.Build quality:This is one area that I have to complain about. Originally, it felt very solid in the hand and was excellent, but I've taken the back on and off too many times, apparently. The phone has developed an unsettling creaking by the buttons on the right side of the phone. I cannot stand creaking in a device. Replacing the back shell with a new one fixes the creaking completely, but it shouldn't be necessary. Either the microSD and microSIM slots should be accessible without removing the back cover, or the cover shouldn't be so frail. I can see no visible distortion or damage, but apparently the alignment is wrong by a few micrometers now and it can slip past the edge of the phone just far enough to squeak in a most annoying fashion. I recommend carefully doing everything in as few removals of the back as possible. The build quality truly is excellent, as long as it doesn't creak.Storage:The microSD slot provides ample opportunity to expand the mediocre 8GB of internal storage. However, that doesn't help when Spotfiy can only use the internal storage, and when Nokia Here can only download maps to internal storage. If I could put my Spotify music on the microSD card, I would be perfectly content with the storage situation. This is absurd. We're talking about a change in file paths being all that stands in my way. This should be fixed, yesterday.Overall, an excellent device I have no trouble recommending to anyone.",2013年12月22日 在美国审核

After doing much research, there appears to be no way around it now, so one of the main features I used is now gone. Of course, had I known this, I wouldn't have updated.

Amazing Value!,"I have been buying things online for well over 5 years now and I have never once written a review for a product.

Coming to the phone itself, I could not be more impressed. I had been using a Lumia 920 for the past year and a half and recently broke it pretty badly. Looking for a new windows phone, I decided to give this a go especially since it was so inexpensive and that too off-contract. I notice no lag on this phone compared to my 920.

Excellent Phone for an amazing price.,"Everyone has already posted all the pros and cons that I could think of but, I would also like to add that it is very easy to use. I've used Androids and iPhones most of my life and only recently started using Windows 8. What amazed me was the fact that I caught on to the Windows OS faster than Windows 8 on my desktop. Within an hour I had the phone customized to my liking and it still continues to be a great phone. One of the only complaints I have is just a minor one too, and that is the sensitivity of the touchscreen. It would randomly either open a random app or put the start screen into editing mod, and that isn't even as bad as it sounds. Overall this is a great phone, I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a fast phone at a good speed.",2013年12月21日 在美国审核
Needs better instructions-how to activate SIM card,"This a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. However, a word of warning. I put the micro SIM card in following the directions, but couldn't find what my phone number was. I searched the web and found that if I went into settings-phone-about, the phone number should show up on the SIM card, but it didn't. I reread the directions for setting up the phone and I had done everything I was told to-and still no phone number. I even watched a youtube video on setting up the phone and no mention about finding the phone number.So I went to the AT&amp;T site and looked up the Go Phone and found out that I needed to activate the SIM card on the AT&amp;T site. There was nothing in the set up directions stating that you need to activate the SIM card. I am sure that there are others out there like me that need to be walked through set up. But, it would help if they gave you all the directions so you can actually use the phone! Now that it is up and running, I couldn't be happier. Like I said at the beginning, this is a great smart phone for the money and I am pleased with it-it's easy to use and has many features I've seen on more expensive phones.",2014年2月19日 在美国审核
Amazing Phone!,"You can not go wrong with this phone. I had purchased this as my first smartphone because I knew I did not want an android phone, but was unsure of the windows platform. I loved it.

Email issues...and they are crooks,"I bought this phone at a retail store (RS). I want to share my experience. I've had this phone for about 3 months. I use my phone quite a bit. I sell things online, so I do lots of emails. I also text with friends and family.Here are a list of things I use most often on this phone:Email (lots of issues with it, will explain more below)Text (ok most of the time. Once in a while the recipient doesn't get the picture)Internet Explorer (works fine. Can't upload pictures on Craigslist on the desktop version)Phone (ok most of the time. Sound quality is good. Can't switch when a 2nd call comes in. Keypad is not very responsive when making entries during a call, such as entering a credit card number or press a number to make a selection)Camera (average camera. Used to get a green flickery screen once in a while when entered into camera mode. Hasn't happened since I did a factory reset on the phone)Nokia Music (works)Nokia Here (map and navigation. It's the best feature. Uses GPS instead of data. Very helpful when traveling outside the coverage area, which I often do)Calendar (allows to set reminder up to one week ahead which is nice. I had an iphone 4 prior and reminder was up to 2 days ahead which I found useless)Whatsapp (notification is delayed. Sometimes by 30 minutes, sometimes by 3 hours)More detail regarding the native email app. I have 4 yahoo accounts, one aol account, and one gmail account set up on this phone. The most frequent it can fetch email is every 15 minutes. I don't like it but it is what it is. The biggest problem is it randomly and constantly prompts for password, saying the password stored is incorrect. I don't fight it. I just enter it again, based on the forums I've read. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I would have email sitting in the OUTBOX because my password is ""incorrect"". I have tried deleting the account and setting it up again, and again, and again. One account eventually kept syncing so I couldn't even delete the account. It would drain my battery in 2 hours. I had to power down my phone. But as soon as I power up the phone that account would sync again nonstop. Finally I managed to delete that account and re-setup. I called Nokia. They told me since I've done everything they would have told me to do (remove email, power cycle, take battery out...), the only other thing is to do a factory reset. I've done that 3 times but the problem didn't go away.The phone would have been a perfect phone for me (and great price) if the email would have worked properly.UPDATE May 13, 2014I sent the phone back to Nokia for warranty. It came back saying ""water or physical damage"" and is not covered by warranty. I know the phone has never been dropped in water. The only water exposure would be little splashes by the sink when I brush my teeth or wash my hands. The error I get is obviously a firmware issue (I used to work as a test engineer at a cell phone company). Nokia just tries to find every way not to admit there are issues and refuse to honor their warranty. Bad ethics. Will never buy another Nokia product.UPDATED July 25, 2015I was just going to keep the phone to stream music. When I tried to turn it on shortly after it came back from repairs, I can feel the initial power on vibration, but the display is now dead. I know when I sent the phone in, aside from the email issue the phone was more or less functioning properly, but now the phone is useless. I held on to it expecting one of these days I will take the phone apart and see what is going on. Today I finally had the time and mood to open up the phone. Upon inspection, I see no signs of water damage, at least there is no corrosion on the board. The cable from the screen to the board was just dangling, so I thought the service person just forgot to plug it back in. Then I noticed the connector on the board is missing! I have attached a picture. The connector should be where the red arrow is. From what I learned in school, a solder joint is very strong. To try to pry the connector off will most likely damage the circuit board.I tried contacting Nokia phone repair, which is now Microsoft. They are only open Monday-Friday. There is no email option.I will call them again on Monday and will update my review.I stil",2014年3月11日 在美国审核

"After Two Months, No, Just No.  Here Are Some Negative Things About It.","I've had this phone for two months.I originally really enjoyed the phone, but after two months I can't stand it.It works extremely well as a phone, but as a smartphone it's mediocre. There are hundreds of positive reviews.I'll list the negative aspects I found with this phone.-Lack of RAMWith only 512mb of RAM, multitasking on this phone stinks.If you are browsing the web, and reply to a text message, you will see ""Resuming..."" when you try to switch back and forth the two apps.Not only is this annoying, but Internet Explorer will lose your 'recent browsing history' so when you hit the back button, instead of going to the previous page, it will take you to the main launcher screen.This is incredibly annoying.-Lack of storage spaceIt has 8gb of space.Over 5gb is used by Windows Phone operating system.There is a Micro SD card, but you can not install apps to the Micro SD card.It can only be used for music, video, photos.So you only have a few gbs to store apps.I never experienced a problem with lack of storage space on a phone until I used this phone, and I ran out of space within two months.-Lack of appsThere are games on Windows Phone.But that's about it.I only use a few apps, and none of them are on Windows Phone.The store has a lot of fake apps, too.You may think you are downloading Google Chrome, but its really a fake app that is filled with ads.When using Internet Explorer, you will find 'bugs' when trying to access some websites.There aren't very many alternatives (and many are just overlays based on Internet Explorer) so it will be impossible to do some things.For example, I can't log into my local bank's website because every time I try to enter my user name the keyboard pops down as soon as I type one letter.-No File Explorer, And Poor File HandlingThere is no file explorer on this phone.When you connect it to a PC, you can see a couple folders for your Photos, Music, and Videos.It's locked up tight.If you use an app to create something, you have to store it on the cloud.That's a big pain in the butt.Not only that, but the only way you can add music or videos to the phone is by either purchasing them through the store, or connecting the phone to your PC.If you try to download an MP3, you will be able to listen to it, but you won't be able to save it.-Random ""Find My Phone"" GlitchesI set my phone up on windowsphone.com so I could log onto the website and have Microsoft ring my phone, or lock it whenever I couldn't find it.It really worked awesome the first couple times I tried it.Then one day, I tried to do it told me ""Windows is having trouble locating your phone.""A couple days later, at 4:30 AM, my phone started ringing.It was the same 'ring' that comes on whenever Windows is trying to find my phone.I tried to silence it, but guess what?It kept ringing.I had to take my battery out, because when I restarted the phone it did it again.I don't know what happened, if hackers are able to ring Windows Phones, or what, Microsoft did not reply to my support email on the subject.-Alarm Not LoudI used to use my phone as my alarm clock.Unless I've developed a medical condition in the past two months, this phone does not work very well in that aspect.The built in alarm sounds are pretty weak, and overall volume is pretty low.-No notificationsUnless you have a bunch of live tiles set up, there is no way of getting notifications, like in iOS or on Android.If I get outbid on an eBay auction, for example, I don't know unless I check.Same goes for text and emails.Although, I guess I should say that the phone does make an alert sound when it receives a text or email.-No Siri or Google Now ThingI always thought Google Now was stupid.But I used it more than I realized.Lumia has voice search which can be accessed by holding your finger over the Windows button, which is pretty good when it comes to converting my voice to text.The problem is, if I say something like ""Set an alarm for 2:30PM"" instead of setting an alarm for 2:30, it searched Bing for ""set an alarm for 2:30PM""-Bad CameraMaybe I got a dud.It's 5 megapixels, but it doesnt have flash.So, I can't use it as a flashlight.Seriously though, I'm not impressed with the camera.When I take a picture of my kids, it usually turns out blurry.My old Nokia 5800 from 2008 has a 3 megapixel camera, and it works much better.I'm not a photographer, but I like to take pictures of my kids. I pick up my tablet, or use my digital camera when its picture time.There you go.Some negatives.",2014年1月29日 在美国审核

Not so Great!They assured me the replacement would be as ""good as new.""A week later Phone #2 arrived.Right out of the box it had an issue...The phone would completely shut down and restart whenever a text was sent.Back to At&amp;t Store and again we were put in touch with the AT&amp;T warranty dept.Again they acknowledged that the phone needed to be replaced.After spending 30 minutes with the representative begging for a ""new "" phone, the only thing they ""could"" do is send out a remanufactured device.A week later Phone #3 arrives.It seems to work fine but a week into using we noticed the battery was being depleated even when it was turned off.Back to AT&amp;T.This time warranty sent out a new battery hoping to resolve the situation.It did not.Trip #4 to the At&amp;T store.By now I enter the store and I feel like Norm on ""Cheers"" everyone knows my name.This time I let a store represenative help me with the warranty people.As in the past we were offered a remanufactured device.I refused.They told me at first this was my ""only"" option.I told them I wanted a differnt phone altogether. They told me they could not do that.After having the store rep speak to the warranty people they offered me a $29 slider phone as a replacment.What a joke!After 45 minutes on the phone they finally offered an LG Optimus G.We took it.So you as a buyer haved a decision to make.Do you take your chances on the Nokia 520.Sure we could have had a run of bad luck and gotten 3 bad phones out of 3.I am not sure of the odds on that but it seems to me like more than bad luck and more likely a qualtiy control issue with Nokia.Further, I can assure you that you do not want to deal with the AT&amp;T warranty dept. My experience is that they could care less about you as the customer... it is all about the bottom line and giving the customer the least they can get away with.My adivce would be to at the very least look at other phones.Sure the Nokia Lumina 520 is tempting but I can tell you that in the long run it was not worth the trouble for me.",2014年2月6日 在美国审核
Windows needs to step up their game,"This phone leaves much to be desired and I would not recommend it to anybody.Pros:• The home screen app layout is nice.• The ability to customize icon layout, size, and color is great.Cons• The phone is SLOW!• Keyboard is laggy and often autocorrects basic words to something completely different.• The web browser is often unresponsive and will jump to random pages.• You can go 'back' a page but not 'forward'.• The app market is pitiful containing thousands of low quality apps that you will try and uninstall. It doesn't seem like they monitor it at all.• Most (nearly all) companies and startups don't support windows phone.If you purchase this phone you will be disappointed.",2014年7月21日 在美国审核

"Amazing, inexpensive phone","I have owned flagship phones, prepaid pieces of junk, international phones, flip phones, etc.This Lumia 520 is by far and away the best deal on a phone I've ever seen.That's not to say it's the best phone ever, clearly you can spend hundreds more to make that happen.What this phone did was show that an inexpensive phone needn't be cheap too.As others have said, if you're on the fence, just purchase this already.It's a no brainer.I will note, I did get mine significantly cheaper than the price listed here - the brick and mortar store that makes the OS on this phone was running a demo that knocked off many dollars on any item.Anyway, onto more of the review.Overall build/design of the phone - The phone is a very basic look which I find better.It's functional and nothing more, but it isn' also abrasive looking or ugly.The back is made of that soft touch plastic and I love that stuff.It provides grip, it doesn't feel 'cheap', and it doesn't scratch/dent easily.All the physical buttons are on the right side of the phone - which is nice too.You can grip your phone in your left hand without pushing some volume button or what not.The buttons are OK to push - the power works best and so does the camera button(which has two stages so you can focus and snap a pic quickly).The volume rocker is harder to push and push quickly, but you can just hold it to turn volume up/down.Also note, if you take the back off to pull the battery or SD card or what not, make sure you put the cover back on very well - mine was off by a tad and the camera button didn't engage.Overall, the phone is built solidly, it's good looking, and everything is laid out well.Screen - This is always hard as you have to physically look at the screen to decide if you like it or not.I find the panel to be good given the price, size, etc.The resolution is just fine for a 4'' screen.Yes, a full 1080p screen is good, but even as a tech guy I thought it was overkill for a phone.The screen gets bright enough if you set it to high.You can only set it to low, medium, and high.Also you can leave it on auto, which I do.It works well enough and I can always read the screen.Colors are bright and accurate as far as I can tell.You can adjust more specific color things in the settings too.The IPS makes it so you can view it well without having it dead on.I will say it'sa very glossy screen so reflections do get noticed.There is some of that dark 'banding' I'll call it at the bottom of the screen.Many phones, laptops, etc. I have, have had this, so I get over it.The touch screen works very well and while I'm not wearing gloves in the Arizona summer, I did put a cloth over my hand and try it - it worked just as well.No bad touches or anything amiss with the touch screen.Call quality/data/signal - I'll put these all into the same category as I don't wish to review any specific network.The calls on this phone work well, they sound OK.It's a bit fuzzy, as if you're talking on a cell phone (go figure, but I've had much clearer calls on cell phones recently).Nobody has complained that they can't hear me well.Data on this sucker is HSPA 21, which is fast enough for me.I get the typical 2-5mbps down in my area and about 1.5mpbs up.Things load quickly on the phone, it syncs stuff well, and it doesn't stop my day.My signal strength is about par for my other Samsung, LG, etc. phones, so it's nothing to write home about, but it's acceptable.My old motorola phone still holds a great signal where my other phones struggle, so it could be better.Software/OS - I won't be reviewing the Windows phone 8 in depth.It's a very nice OS, slick, good looking, gets stuff done without getting in your way.Yes, it has limits.Sure, the available applications are behind iOS and Android, which is a valid concern.The store is also confusing compared to the others, so finding stuff isn't as easy, which is odd given most apps are very easy to use.The included Nokia software is awesome I'll say.Their version of maps and navigation are very good - hasn't failed me yet and just as good as google maps/nav.The Nokia music is great - it beats pandora and google music hands down - simply because it's free.Also, it does work very well.The included software for the camera is nice - nothing mind-blowing but it's useful and I like it.I'll talk about the physical camera more.Mail, messages, phone, etc. are all very easy to use and look nice.Overall, Microsoft did well with the OS here and partnering with Nokia provided a bit of extra 'oomph' to the mix.Go to a phone store and tell the sales people to leave you alone and try out a windows phone for a while to see how it works.That's the only way you'll know regardless of how many reviews you read.Camera - It's a basic camera.Nokia does well with optics so even though this is 'only' 5mp, it takes decent looking and clear pictures.It doesn't have a flash, which I don't mind anyway - any cell phone with a flash makes pictures look washed out or if you don't use a flash, it's just dark and grainy.It takes pictures quickly and as I said about some of the nice software, you can flash 5 pictures quickly to pick your favorite. I don't get why people slam cameras on phones - they work well enough and aren't the main attraction - some phones come with respectable cameras now but you'll pay for it.If you need that, get one.Otherwise, buy a good stand-alone camera you can use lenses and such on and enjoy excellent pictures.Overall - I'm impressed with this phone and even more so given the rock-bottom price.It has some signs of a 'cheap' phone such as you must manually pull your SD card out - no spring loaded ejection (this phone can take an SD card, unlike MANY new Android devices and all iPhones.The ability to add a lot more storage, cheaply and quickly, is good regardless.)The screen is a bit glossy, but oh well.It's a full, honest smartphone that has good specs and works scarily well for the price of an impulse buy.Purchase this phone and save yourself money upfront with a cheap phone.Purchase a prepaid plan and save yourself money every month.Don't ever worry about a 2 year contract again!",2013年8月15日 在美国审核

Worthless OS for a smartphone; Bad customer service,"As a phone, it's fine. If you want it as a smartphone, not so much. Biggest drawback: no html emails. Thus, you get something that says that it has a link... an image... an embedded code - can't read or even see any of it. On several occasions, I've had to email my emails to someone else to have them send back the link in a text. It's annoying. (For the record, this isn't about the phone... it's the OS. Windows is the problem and while I'm fine with that for my laptop, for mobile phone usage, it sux. Only buy this if you can't afford an android or iphone.)Also, the ATT customer service for gophone is HORRENDOUS. I bought this as an in-between-jobs phone, I actually tried to upgrade to a samsung galaxy 5 on a two-year att contract. No less than 10 times in 5 hours did I speak with an att rep as i got lied to, received bad info, and in the end, had to return the phone and cancel the contract because nothing that was said by ATT was accurate. Note that you cannot move your gophone number to a contract phone - unless you're in an att company store (NOT affiliate store) - or at least that's what I've surmised. You can ask att but there's no point; they don't know their own rules or capabilities. (And to add insult to the injury, they actually billed me for a contract that was only live for an hour. I had to wait... again... on hold and then to explain it all again, just to get the charges removed.)So short version: fine as a throw-away phone with a disrespectful and inept provider, but don't buy this, even cheap, as a longterm investment.",2014年12月22日 在美国审核

"Nice phone, but with a serious problem","I bought this phone, along with a 32 GB SD expansion-card, specifically for its ability to download Maps and store them on the phone locally, so that I can use the Maps for navigation if I am out of range of a cellular signal, but still have a GPS signal. Imagine my surprise when I installed the SD expansion-card and discovered that this phone only supports storing media files on this expansion storage card, nothing else. No app-data can be stored on the expansion-card. No Map data, no PDF's. Only pictures, video, and music files, nothing else.What's particularly annoying is that this phone originally supported the ability for the user to decide what to store on their own Storage media that they payed for. The original version of the 520's ""Phone Storage"" Settings app had a specific option for storing Maps on the SD expansion card. So clearly there is no technical reason for this option to be removed. It appears that Nokia originally allowed users to choose what to store where, but when they sold their entire Handset division to Microsoft, some genius at Microsoft decided to lock users out of their own storage-media. I will return this phone for a full refund.",2014年3月30日 在美国审核

"My first Windows Phone, and likely my last","I have extensive experience with entry-level pre-paid smartphones, and the Nokia Lumia 520 is probably the biggest disappointment I've run across.My reason for purchasing this particular phone was two-fold: 1) I wanted to test out AT&amp;T'snetwork in my area, and 2) I've been curious about the Windows Phone platform.At just $69, I figured the Lumia would be a cheap way to satisfy both of my curiosities.While I'm trying hard in this review to compartmentalize my criticisms of the Windows Phone platform away from the Lumia itself, there is some degree of entanglement which is hard to isolate.Even a simple task like playing my library of MP3s (on a 32GB microSD card) seemed to bring this device to its knees.Whether this is a Lumia hardware problem or a Microsoft software issue, I cannot be certain.All I know is that playing a large MP3 library on the 520 is more of a hassle than it should be.The phone would lock up every time I tried to initiate playback.The camera and battery life are passable for a low-end device.Neither one is particularly impressive.The processor seems under-powered, as was evidenced by the device's sluggish performance on Temple Run.There was definite hiccuping throughout the game and touch response, which is very important in this game, seemed to lag at times.I definitely would not recommend this phone for mobile gaming, unless you're opting for simple titles that require little graphics processing.Windows Phone, like any platform, has its strengths and weaknesses.In the case of WP, the lack of app selection really cripples a phone that already has obvious hardware limitations.There are basic apps (Pandora, Facebook, etc.) that work just fine on the Lumia.However, for those who seek a richer smartphone experience, I think Windows Phone is still way behind iOS and Android.It's all a matter of personal preference, but anyone leaving those two platforms for WP should be prepared for a much smaller library.People coming from a non-smartphone background probably won't notice the difference as much.In summation, the Lumia 520 is an ""okay"" value for those with low expectations.For those seeking a more vibrant pre-paid smartphone experience, there are better offerings out there which are comparably priced.",2013年11月26日 在美国审核

Does not allow you to download an attachment via Gmail,4. Can't attached documents unless you take the extra step of using the Office App.5. I think the reason why the Apps are so limited is that everything seems to be based on the terribly thin Internet Explorer App6. Internet explorer app extremely limited in function which in turn limits other apps.7. The visually impaired will notice that you not able to word wrap after zooming into an article.8. Speakers are not good at all.9. Camera needs stabilization. Takes many fuzzy pics.10. Fragmentation. Update this thing already.

I called a friend and asked if the sound quality was good he said yes. After I told him, he was on speakerphone he said I sounded amazing and he couldn't tell-Listening to music is great on the phone nice and loud-Offline map with turn by turn navigation. This is why I bought the phone for this feature, figured if I could use this feature without any internet connection I could save myself from buying a GPS.-Keyboard is easy to type on-Interface is easy to use-Message title has a winking face when their is an unread text message ;)-I have 2013 Honda Civic and the phone does work with hands free Honda Bluetooth that is builtinto the car, and it will support the read you your text messages feature :)One thing I'm missing on phone is when you send picture messages it doesn't do the little up and down arrow showing that its trying or receive or send a message(Hope this makes sense) so you kinda just have to guess when your picture message has been sentThings you need to know-If you are already an existing go phone customer you will need call AT&amp;T, so they can transfer your number and money to the new micro sim unless your last phone already had a micro sim (currently the only go phones on AT&amp;Tthat have a micro sim are the Samsung Galaxy Express, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this phone.)-If you don't have/want to pay for data you need to disable data otherwise you might see GPRS charges on your account. I had one that cost $4.44 and I wasn't happy. Disabling data will insure you don't receive any of these mysterious GPRS charges. However, if you disable data you will no longer see 4G on the phone and you won't be able to send or receive picture messages (you can still get regular text messages)-Battery life varies depending on how much you use your phoneI am grandfathered into the old $1 a day plan which doesn't have any data, so I'll guess have to change to one of the new plans or I will end up paying more with the random GPRS charges when data is enabled-Not as many Apps compared to Apple and Android, but has the most common apps people want and Windows seems to be trying to get more...As I previously stated I have an iPad 4, so any games, emails, or video calls are done on there.My phone is just for calls, texting, picture messages, taking pictures and very light web use when wifi is available and I need to look up something when I'm out and about, and now GPS :)Overall, if your someone like me who upgrading from an older android, can get used to the Windows OSand can live with the fact that not every app is available in the App Store then I think you'll be very happy with this phone.",2013年8月15日 在美国审核

Good phone if you like Microsoft,"Essentially, the phone has all the basics, is easy to figure out and does what it is asked.The battery really lasted long, especially since I turned off all the unnecessary apps and did not keep data connected when I didn't need to.The screen is big and clear and pleasant to work with.The images flip sideways when you turn the phone.Unfortunately, I am more concerned with things that disappoint me, such as the quiet alert tones that come with the phone and which cannot be replaced with downloaded ones.One Note, a quick note taking program, requires signing up with a username that stores your notes in a cloud and not on the phone.You can pin each note to the start page, but otherwise, you must store it off the phone.There is no ""delete"" button and you must use the ""Back/Left"" arrow to backtrack, leaving all your paths to be retraced.My biggest beef, however, is that I need browser flexibility which the phone does not have.I need to link quickly from emails to a work website, but the Internet Explorer browser on the phone requires that I sign in with a password on that website every time I link to it.Explorer can be bypassed for other internet browsing, if you download another one that Windows phones will take (not Opera mini), but emails still must use Explorer, so that doesn't help me.Just be prepared when you buy such a phone that you will have to love being a Microsoft and Windows patron.",2013年8月11日 在美国审核

ATTENTION TRACFONE USERS,"Amazingly this works with Tracfone. Before we used a iPhone 4s Verizon, bought from Amazon and transferred to Tracfone BYOP successfully and everything still works today. Didn't know of Tracfone's changes, so now it's AT&amp;T, unlocked phones, T-Mobile, and some other various carriers that can be brought into BYOP, not Verizon! (As it was a BYOP carrier before)TRANSFER: Old Tracfone cellphone to this newer samsung. Already had a Sim card meant for the process. (Strangely before the iPhone 4s didn't need a Sim card, still doesn't have one, but still on that Tracfone plan for the iPhone). The BYOP process didn't work right away when we tried transferring it online. Called Tracfone for assistance, blah blah provided information, this that, op nope your phone isn't compatible with Tracfone sorry, and bye. HOWEVER, we tried transferring online again and it worked successfully!!RESULTS: It uses AT&amp;T cell towers, makes calls and everything successfully, Image transfers through text messages is iffy since it can't send multiple images in bulk. Just make sure to go through the steps listed for BYOP, do it once or twice and Image transfer along with data usage should work fine.",2016年7月15日 在美国审核
Used Note 3 to replace broken Droid Bionic..,"Wow!!What a phone!!I had long ago decided to replace my aging Droid Bionic with a Samsung Galaxy S4, but a phone Guru friend recommended that I consider the Note 3 instead of a Galaxy S4 as a replacement for my old, tired and broken Droid Bionic.After reading several reviews comparing the Note 3 with the Galaxy S4, and speaking with a local cell phone expert, I decided to spend $385 on a Note 3 instead of $250 for a Galaxy S4.When I placed the Amazon order for the Note 3, I wondered if $385, versus $250 for a Galaxy S4, was well spent.Well, after spending several hours learning how to use my ""loaded with features Note 3"", I am happy that I spent the additional $135.Compared to my Bionic (not a fair comparison I know) the Note 3 is Screaming Fast, and has lots of features that I hope to master in a month or two.If a potential user checks-out any of the dozen or so YouTube videos re the outstanding features of the Note 3 (Snapdragon Quad 800, great GPU, 3MB RAM, Stylus and on and on) and you might consider the Note 3 (or Note 4 if price is no consequence) as your next smart phone.I found several reviews comparing the Note 3 to the Note 4 that recommend the user stay with their Note 3 unless upgrading to a Note 4 is virtually free.One reviewer indicated that by late 2015 a successor to the Note 4 will be available with many improvements (though I can't imagine what can be done to improve the Note Platform).My Note 3 is another Samsung GEM!!",2014年12月28日 在美国审核
"Great camera and sound, large, but slim. durable. 'rich' looking.","best phone I've had so far.switched from AT&amp;T to Verizon with this phone, and glad I did, customer service has been excellent.there were problems with overheating and the battery draining quickly - which you can see via an internet search -Verizon replaced the phone, but I found that the problem really seems tied to Google updating/syncing photos and videos - once I turned that off (and only do it on demand and when plugged in) the problem seems solved.have not been thrilled by the Note feature, but that is probably just my ignorance.Excellent camera, and I love the Google voice search/response feature (of course, that's an android, not just the Note 3).I am fairly careful with my phones, so haven't put a screensaver on it, nor do I use a case (most of the time) due to the weight - and find the phone and screen to be pretty durable, it still looks like new after about 2 years.it's large, and rather unwieldy, but for my old eyes, ability to see things on the screen makes up for it!it is slim and light enough to not be a problem.the sound is really good too, I almost always use the speakerphone on it for making calls, and like the sound when I play music or listen to audio books (and I'm fussy!).I haven't tried other brands, so can't comment on how the note 3 compares, tho I did look at them in the store before settling on this phone",2015年7月2日 在美国审核
Fantastic phone for those who want to be productive,"I bought the first couple of iPhones when they first came out and use my wife's every now and then and I've also owned 4 or 5 different android devices and the note series is by far my favorite. I purchased a Note 2 when it first came out and loved it so I decided to go with the note 3 and it is an even better version of an already great phone.I was debating between this, the S5, and the HTC One M8 but I went with the note and took the ""hit"" in processing power for and extra Gb of ram (which is amazing).I've already rooted and installed the hyper drive rom but even without the extras of a custom rom this phone has so many features that make it a fantastic productivity tool.The S Pen alone is something that I use literally every day at work to take meeting notes. I work with meeting software that allows you to share your screen so I can do that while also taking nones on my Note 3 without showing everyone what I'm writing down. Then I sync with evernote and have all of my notes in the cloud, it's perfect.Fantastic phone with a great price here on amazon, couldn't be happier.",2014年4月29日 在美国审核
Great for busy man!,"We had a Verizon upgrade coming to us, so I was looking for a all-in-one device for my husband. He just wanted a phone and tablet. I saw a friend with this Note 3 and knew he would love it! He checked it out in the store and excited about everything but the price! Just as we got our upgrade the Note 3 went to $1! I grabbed it! He loves it! The screen is big enough for reading, the phablet is small enough to Palm! He only has 1 device to keep track of! He doesn't want a tablet at all now!The Note 3 runs on the same Android 4.4 as Note 4 and if you sign in with Samsung they upgrade you to 5.0! Between the Note 3 and 4 there really isn't a lot of difference, so we went for price.I was going to get one too but the price went back to $100. I was concerned about the size, Note has a 5.7 screen, for me to hold on to with the kids in my arms. I got the Galaxy s5, with a 5.1 screen, it's only a little smaller and fits my life better! Samsung also upgraded s5 to 5.0!The pro and con on Note 3 is the size, 5.7 ins. It's prefect for some and to big for others. If you want a all-in-one go with the Note, if you want screen size but smaller phone go with s5!I highly recommend both!",2015年6月29日 在美国审核
Great Phone,"I bought this phone in December 2013. l still love it. The drawback is its size. l hare small hands and it can be difficult to grasp because it is big.It is also heavier than my previous phones. The size is why I bought it though - l wanted the big screen and it is worth it. lt is very durable. I did put a case on it but it is a lightweight one that only covers the edges and back. I have dropped my phone many times with no damage.Samsung does have a lot of useless programs that come pre-installed but I haven't had issues with those. My battery easily lasts all day most days. If the battery seems to be draining quickly, clearing the cache and restarting the phone seems to solve the problem.The On-screen keyboard is easier to use on the bigger screen. The split windows are now useable. Games are easier to play. Everything is easier to read.One more drawback is that the volume buttons and power button are directly opposite of each other. I often end up pressing both at the same time.The rest of the phone isn't much different from the Galaxy Nexus. the programs are the same. The screens look the same only bigger.",2014年7月11日 在美国审核
Great buy,"First off, I bought this phone used from Cellular Trendz. There was an issue with the camera, but they were great and worked with me to get the part to fix the issue before a big event came up. I was replacing an LG G2 that I had, after many drops, finally killed and had no insurance on. I liked the G2, but I have to say, I love the Note 3. If I could have afforded the Note 4, I would have gone with that, but for my needs and budget, you really can't beat the Note 3. I love the size, which is so much easier on my eyes. I draw, so I do find the s pen really useful for doodling on the phone. I don't do any heavy gaming, so I've had no issues with lagging or memory. It does have bloatware that Samsung should really let you delete, but other than that, this phone knocks it out of the park, especially for a phone that isn't on the bleeding edge any more. Looking back, I really wish I'd originally gone with this phone instead of the G2.",2015年3月31日 在美国审核

My girl friend wanted a phone that would be better than the generic $40,"When I ordered this item it was said to take about two to three weeks to come in.

Having the unlimited data from VZW still, I knew I'd be paying retail price to keep my data plan and wanted to make sure I waited for the right phone. Samsung did a great job, and I personally am glad they did not jump the screen up to 6 inches for the Note 3. The display size is perfect, but any larger would be too big for a phone. I waited to see how HTC's One Max would turn out. I liked it's aluminum build, but for me, it just didn't have enough to challenge the Note 3. Thus, I went with my first Samsung phone. It's fast, feature loaded, and I have a lot of fun with it.

Here's a note....The Galaxy Note blows everything else out of the water.,"A fan of the Motorola Droids I was little leery to make a change.I first tried the newer Galaxy S5.It was pretty much all plastic and felt cheap, so I decided to try the Note.I did a lot of research and the Note 4 for the price wasn't really worth the $299 especially with the Note 3 at $99 for almost the same specs (NOW ONLY $1).Beautiful DisplayExtremely ResponsiveIntuitiveMetal Bezel feels sturdy, gives a little heft, but the phone is in no way heavyEven better with Go LauncherI've barely used my tablet, because the screen is so clear and just big enough to do anything I want.Many more features made me fall in love with the Note 3.",2015年1月23日 在美国审核

"Amazing phone, amazing deal.","As an android enthusiast first having a Droid X, then Galaxy Nexus, then that broke and went back to a Droid X2.I also was an avid custom ROM user.This phone is amazing, just perfect.Final Thoughts:LOVE IT, best phone yet.See below for more detailed thoughts.Pros:Blazing fast. With the 3GB RAM and Quad core processor you will NEVER run out of resources.LTE is blazing fast, seems to turn on faster thanHuge screen with gorilla glass 3 (you wouldn't believe the difference even from galaxy nexus with it's ""scratch resistant"" glass). 1080p resolution (enough said).Very long lasting battery.With that 5.7inch screen you better believe it will suck down power.The battery delivers.You can root it, it's a pain but it's doable.Camera is really nice.Custom built in camera and gallery apps are not as good as stock but still pretty good.USB 3.0 - They barely brag about this!The USB 3.0 chord and charger that comes with the phone is amazing.The phone will charge from 0-100 in like 40 minutes with the USB 3 cable.Transferring files is extremely fast with the USB 3 cable (must have a USB 3 port which most new laptops and motherboards have).USB 2 cables and chargers still work with it, the charge is just a little slower.Don't freak out when you see the new male portion of the USB cable, it's not proprietary, it's USB 3 and it is still backwards compatible (the right side of the USB 3 cable is the same as just USB 2).Cons:The bootloader is locked so I can't load custom ROMs.The bloatware is annoying but it's to be expected.NFC doesn't work with Google Wallet even rooted- Annoying, but I think then are working on it.From what I understand it's a hardware thing where the new NFC format isn't compatible.S Pen is useless for me.Waste of space in the handset.I'm sure it's useful for some.It's good for defacing pictures of people that you take.Final Thoughts:LOVE IT, best phone yet.I'll be glad to answer any questions.",2014年4月22日 在美国审核

Very easy to use and I use many-many functions on it. The battery life is great too, unless I acidentally leave on the WiFi or use the GPS. These deplete my battery much faster.

WOW!,"I purchased the Note 3 after a good deal of consideration and research.First off I should relate that I'm into computers.I took my first computer course in 1972 (Fortran) and have kept upwith developments ever sence.I built my own gaming/general purpose rig and repair, modify and troubleshoot computers.I enjoy it.I have been watching the development of cellphones with the same interest.My first cellphone was a Motorola bag phone (remember those?) and have upgraded only when I saw a definite improvement in functionallity but never did so as a matter of fashion.Late last year I decided that it was time to replace my six year old LG ""dumb"" phone.I also had become interested in buying a high end tablet after seeing some of my young in-laws using theirs during the Holidays.I had the thought that it would be great if you could buy a nice tablet that also made phone calls!Of course nothing like that exists.I then began taking a harder look at the high end phones after seeing a HSN show on the iPhone and decided it was time to finally make the jump to a ""smart"" phone.I concluded that the technology had matured to finally deliver the the functionallity that it promised and still be user friendly.After much research I settled on the Samsung.I looked briefly at the S4 but felt it was to small to replicate the tablet experience that I wanted.I'm a Verizon customer (no particular loyality, they just happen to have the best service for my area) so I went to the Verizon store to check out the phone with a salesperson and maybe get a deal.Because they are so new there are no deals on the Note 3.If you feel you can wait a year the phone will certainly be cheaper and in two years it will probably be free with a renewal/upgrade.Verizon wanted $350 for the phone plus $30 to connect it.They also charge a monthly fee for data use.Not the plan use that you contract for but just a fee to use data.SCAM! but what you gonna do?I then went to my old faithful, AMAZON!They listed the Verizon ready phone for $229 with no extra charges.I went back to the Verizon store and told them that if they couldn't match the price there was no way I could ignore a $160 difference.They couldn't so I went home and ordered the phone.I'm an Amazon Prime member ( as an aside:if you order more than three things a year from Amazon, seriously, join Prime.I ordered a forty inch TV for a Christmas gift and it arrived in two days.Free.Wow) and I got a notice that because of high demand my delivery would take a few extra days.I thought; no big deal.I wasn't even really supprised when two days after my order the package showed up on my doorstep.I opened the package and went through the basic setup.I did have to call Verizon support but they were very gracious about connecting and initializing the phone.Now, about the phone.This thing is amazing.The closest approximation I can think of is a laptop the makes phone calls and takes (really good!) pictures.I am new to the whole ""smart"" phone experience as I indicated and have been constantly amazed by the functionallity, capability, and potential of the device.I mean; dual core processor, 3 gigs of RAM, 96 gigs of storage with the expansion slot.By way of comparison my first store bought desktop computer had an industry leading 45 gigs!.The Android OS is Linux based so it has some subtle differences but not to the point of being a problem for PC users.There is definitely a steep learning curve if, like me, you are new to the whole tablet/smartphone experience.It came with almost no user instruction other than initial setup.I went online and found the Samsung users manual and downloaded it.256 pages if you skip all the lawyer stuff in the front.I also got a book on my Kindle account (free) that also helps but I am convinced that, like most electronic gizmos that are continuously developing, by the time I figure out how to really use it I'll be ready for the ""next"" thing.YouTube is also a great resource for instruction on the phone and the various apps.As to the apps;if you order the phone from Amazon it comes pre-loaded with all the Amazon apps and they cannot be uninstalled but why would you want to?And because Google owns the Android OS you are joined at the hip to Google and all its apps and anoying behavior and no, you cannot get rid of it.I have used Google since it first came out in beta but I find them rather spooky.I'm sure the same problem (or worse) exists with the iPhone.One of the first things I noticed about the phone was the very poor battery life.I was used to my old phone keeping a charge for days and I noticed I was only getting 5-6 hours of time on the Note.I researched the situation and found that you should perform a certain ammount of cleanup on the new phone.Built in utillities can accomplish this but the best solution is to download an app called All-In-One Toolbox.Get it from the Amazon AppStore for free.It is a highly regarded app and makes the list of top ten downloads consistently.Using the app's function of disabiling background resource hogs you can up your battery life to maybe a day and a half.Bottom line, the Note 3 is a battery hog so you can just count on keeping it on a charger when not using it.The up side is that it charges fairly quickly.Physicaly, the phone is large.Even for my 6'2"" oversized hands.I find myself constantly fumbling around when using it, trying to find a comfortable position.Another problem is when shifting the grip on the phone I inadvertently press one of the soft keys and thereby change the screen.Annoying but something that I'm sure would be a problem with any phone and particularly with smaller phones, i.e. S4.I just looked up and realized its 3 A.M. I thought this review would be about two paragraphs.I'll try to add more impressions later.Bottom line; this device is, in its small way, a life changer.Like I stated earlier, a laptop that makes phone calls.It's just a little too large and heavy, with a protective case (which I recommend), to fit in a shirt pocket but I have no trouble finding a way to carry it.And all those times in the past when I was away from home and I wanted to do something that required a computer and internet access and was frustrated are now history.I guess I'm now a connected dude!",2014年2月16日 在美国审核

Then we took it to the local Verizon store to activate it and hook it to her existing account.She had been using this exact phone for several years prior to her losing it and US buying this one for her. Verizon said they cannot activate this particular phone because it is too old and no longer supported by Verizon. If you decide you want to buy this phone please do your due diligence, contacting your cellular provider and confirmed that they will activate this particular phone. It will save you much grief. Had to return the device, as it was useless, sadly.",2022年1月27日 在美国审核
Great phone despite some minor annoyances,"This is a great phone.I love the big screen.The phone is fast, which is very important to me since my last phone had a very long and annoying lag time when I tried to make phone calls.Apps run quickly.The camera takes nice pictures.A couple of annoying things about it are:1) The audio volume rockers are directly opposite the screen on/off button, which results in many unintentional presses that change the volume when trying to turn off the screen or turning off the screen when trying to adjust the volume.2)There is no way to turn the sound on and off from the lock screen.Also, the rocker switch doesn't have any effect with the screen off or the lock screen on.To silence or un-silence the phone, it's necessary to unlock the phone and then use the volume rockers.3) The video recording software freezes often.",2013年12月13日 在美国审核

New Fan of Samsung because of the Note 3,"This review is for the Note 3 in general, but also as a recommendation for LaptopAngels if that happens to be the seller somebody might be looking at. I gave LaptopAngels a 5-star review for sales and shipping, as well as for handling a return with courteous professionalism.The phone: The phone, the phone, the phone. I take back every bad thing I've ever said about Samsung. The 2-year-old Note 3 stacks right up there with every 2015 phone I've had my hands on. My daily driver is a Droid Turbo, and this Note 3 is every bit as much fun to ""drive"" as my Turbo is.I should qualify by saying that the Note 3 we eventually bought is still running Kitkat 4.4.2 (So I can't speak for this phone with Lollipop 5.x installed) and we plan to keep it on Kitkat... one BIG reason we were in the market for an older phone was an increasingly *severe* dislike for Lollipop. Basically, this phone replaces a new LG G4 with 5.1 (which replaced a G3 with 5.0) and the new owner could not be any happier. She had a Galaxy Note II before, and it croaked, which was the only reason she needed another phone. It was my mistake to steer her toward LG; should've considered the Note 3 in the first place. Samsung definitely got it right with this one.",2015年8月9日 在美国审核

So far I am really loving this phone.,"I don't use a cell phone a lot, but I love the functionality of this phone. It is more like a mini tablet. The pen that comes with it is very handy, and activates the phone when you pull it out. It is also great for more precise selections and for note taking. I am very happy with theresolution of the screen and the response of both touch and pen. Buying the phone from Amazon and setting up a new Verizon account was painless. I easily got the account and on-line payment set up without a hitch. I also transferred my AT&amp;T phone number to the phone without any problems.I won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can read all of that on the product page. I just want to let you know what I think of it as a user of the phone. At this point in time, I couldn't be happier with this phone or the Verizon service.UPDATE 5/07/16I've had this phone for a little over 3 years, and I still have no desire to get a new phone. I did, however, recently decide to switch my service provider from Verizon to T-Mobile because of the offerings of T-Mobile which I won't get into. I was assured by the T-Mobile rep that as long as the phone was unlocked, I could replace the Verizon sim card with the one from T-Mobile and the phone would work with no problems after activating the T-Mobile sim card. I am updating this review so that others don't experience what I did if they want to change their provider.First of all, Verizon has never locked any of their 4G phones. Verizon uses a CDMA network which is also used by Sprint and US Cellular, T-Mobile and AT&amp;S use a GSM network. One difference is the polarity used, so phone for each type of network are manufactured to use the specific polarity of the network. The other difference that should be considered by the end user is that on the GSM network customer information is stored on the sim card. This means that you can take the sim card from one phone and insert it into another and it will work.GSM carriers must accept any GSM phone. So they don't have control over the phone you are using. CDMA carriers use network based white lists. So you can only switch phones with your carrier's permission, and the carrier doesn't have to accept any particular phone. There are other differences between the two network types, but those I have mentionedaffect the end user the most.In my case, I had to buy a new phone in order to switch to T-Mobile as a carrier. I was also told by Verizon that this phone ""may"" work with another CDMA carrier, but it my lose functionality. I have had to buy another phone to use the GSM network, and have decided to get the Galaxy Note 4 since I have to give up my Note 3. I hope this helps other in choosing a carrier and a phone.",2014年1月8日 在美国审核
Favorite smartphone Ive had.,"This is definitely the best phone I've owned.My previous were the Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy 1) and then the Galaxy S3. I have always prefered Samsung devices. I like Apples hardware but I hate iOS, so I stick to android devices. After working several jobs selling cell phones, and working with them all the time I always choose to buy samsung. I just think the Galaxy series phones have been really good.Well, the time came for my S3 to upgrade and I was planning on getting the newest ""S"" phone which at the time was the S5. After playing around with one for a bit I just wasn't crazy about it. It seemed bigger than my S3 by a noticeable amount, and had some annoying features that were unable to be turned off. I didn't care about the S Health or anything like that. I care about speed, and features.Thats where the Note shines. It is a large phone, but its actually not that much bigger than an S5. An S5 with an otterbox is bigger than my Note with a slim grip case. I have now had the phone for a couple months and pocketing it is no big deal at all.Also the Note has awesome features. S-Window is really cool, as well as Scrapbooker. S-note is useful for reminders or jotting down a number or something really quick. S-draw is really cool to use. The pen even comes in handy for texting and normal web use.Its screen is also really nice not quite 1080p but its 720p. It looks just fine I watch videos on it all the time.all in all I highly recommend the Note 3. The Note 4 hardware and build quality/materials are better. Its more expensive and has some slightly annoying features though.Consider a Note as your next phone over a Galaxy S.Not to m",2015年1月12日 在美国审核

"Still learning, transitioning from iPhone","Great phone, although I miss the integrated features that the iPhone provides.Excellent battery.I haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed:What I do love:Great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures.Great battery life.I had to charge the iPhone I had twice a day.This I abuse and it still gets me through the day.It also has a removable battery for instant juice.Family I have in the Philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure.ResponsiveIn my transition, things I have noticed:-Native list syncing is not present.I decided to go with Wunderlist.I would have used Google Task, but it's not developed yet.-No button that pulls up voice command like Siri does in the lock screen.The voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like Siri was.You can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked.If it is unlocked, you have to find the app.There is a buttonless voice activation (""Hi Galaxy""), but it stops working sometimes.-Google maps will persist in lock mode, but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen.When you do that, the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again (the iPhone will always show the map when navigating while locked, which was really nice).-Some apps tend to freeze.I simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it.-The text size kept changing on me every time I tried to text.I found you change the default text size with the volume buttons.-I had to be creative to migrate my contacts.I moved everything to Google from my iPhone, then synced with my phone.One thing that is great is that I can manage my contacts now through Google Contacts through my Gmail (they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts!-Text to speech engine is awesome, better than Siri in accuracy and speed, I think.-Camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iPhone, UNLESS you disable security.I've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto-call the numbers I write afterwards, which is really nice.After the novelty of the pen, I reverted to using the on-screen keyboard.I still use it on occasion.I like the availability, especially when sending information to people or writing on maps.I have used the S-Note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns, so that's really nice.I just wish there was more integration, so I can see my notebooks on my computer.For a case, I used the Otterbox Commuter, which works well.It has no belt clip, but I would imagine I'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway.This just slides into my pocket.Did I enjoy my iPhone? yes.simple, works, well integrated, robust, although sometimes non-responsive and poor battery life.Do I enjoy the Galaxy Note? yes.Totally different experience with the larger screen, great battery life, more enjoyment of pictures, video.It's not as well integrated, but it works and does what I want.In a mobile computing device/phone that I have on me all the time the screen, snappiness, battery life, and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience.Will I stay?I think so.I will learn the phone soon enough.The experience is just different.If you have any comments, please do!I'm still learning the phone.It is a great piece of art and master craftsmanship from Samsung.It comes from South Korea, a powerhouse of cutting edge technology and force in the global economy (I was there for a year and can appreciate the history).Not to be confused with China or Japan",2014年3月8日 在美国审核
horrible customer service,When I receive this device I have many options this was the more expensive for replacing my device only reason why I was getting the new Samsung phone was because my device has stopped charging so I purchased a charger so that I can charge the battery as well as the phone app on received device I noticed that the screen did not display the actual time as well as it did not charge the phone the original charger for the Samsung Note was not in the box I received the secondary charger that does not work to charge the phone advised that the merchant please send a new phone and I would send the other back because I didn't want to be without a cell phone I never received any other information regarding my request since then I have purchased batteries so that I can swap the batteries out and charge them through the charger that I purchase that will allow me to charge the battery it's real inconvenient because now I have to spend more money and my phone is not under warranty and I don't want to be without a phone I think that the merchant could have sent out another phone or a new charger to accommodate my situation never again will I purchase devices from this month,2016年9月5日 在美国审核
Awesome phone. best on market.,Best phone. Things you should know.1. Best battery life than any other Android phone I have had.2. Most features that are exclusive for this phone I thought I would use. I do not.For example I do not use the stylus as much as I did. The recent update killed the ease of use and coverting text from handwriting to text. So I do not use it anymore.3. Fast response. Have had this phone for about 9 months. Still just as fast responding to touch and opening apps as day one.4. Can only be used with a max mini SD card of 64gb. This is a minor complaint only.5. Does not get hot. Unless you are doing a lot of stuff while charging this device does not get hot to the touch. The normal running temp is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit but you can not feel it.6. Charges fast from dead to full charge. This is based on stock charger that comes with phone which pushes 2.1 amps. I also use a 3.5 amp car charger which it charges faster with.7. The IR ability I use a lot for controlling my TV and dvr. The app the phone comes with is the best app but the app does need improvement though this is not the phones fault.8. WiFi is fast. My Internet speed tops at 40mb/s and the phone WiFi can do it. Unlike most phones WiFi usually cap at 20mb/s no matter what.9. I have the Verizon 4G lte and the lte I have seen push 60mb/s for speeds so again the phone ability for strong and fast signal is impressive.A bunch of other things positive and negative.I am disappointed in Samsung and their lack more rather restrictions of app abilities but this is not the phone fault.

VERY Pleased with this phone!!,"I have had this phone for a little over a month now and am extremely happy with it. I love everything about it EXCEPT the Visual Voicemail Update that WONT GO AWAY. I DO NOT want Visual Voicemail and besides that, Verizon wants to charge 2.99 a month for it!! I won't go into this any further as it will just spark more rants about unwanted software/bloat ware. The problem with this particular piece of crapware is that notifications CONTINUALLY pop up and sit in the notifications bar at the top of the phone. If you clear it, it comes back, and there is no way to turn it off either! This is the reason for taking off 1 star off the phone¡¦s rating. Other than that, the phone is a real performer, takes wonderful pictures and video and is still slim enough to fit nicely in my back pocket. The phone is big, but so are my hands and it could not fit them better. This is truly a ¡§where have you been all my life¡¨ moment having this phone. The larger display is just awesome and the pen works great too. This phone would be a perfect 10+ without the software/bloat ware thing. But hey, where would the world be without annoying salespeople trying to sell you what you don¡¦t want or need? Anyway, the battery life has been great for me. Most times I can go 2 days without a charge. I do turn my phone off at night though and I don¡¦t play games on it with the exception of Bubble Shootº. I went from the Droid Razr Maxx to this phone and I loved that phone, well I thought I did until I got this phone.

"Worked Great, No Accessories","Worked just like it was straight out of the box. It was great to be able to charge again after my original Note 3 was rusted and corroded around the port. It was a little tricky to figure out how to change out the SIM card. Apparently according to YouTube videos you need the tool which came in the original box. There is no way that you could do it by hand, I had no luck with a pair of tweezers, and even with the original tool took me a few attempts to get the SIM card out. Once put in the new phone I didn't even have to call Verizon, it worked immediately. I also purchased a 128GB Memory Stick to transfer all of my photos and videos from the old phone (It's memory was full so I couldn't upload through the internet and the port was corroded so USB wouldn't work). This phone did not come with the Stylus or the Charger. I found two generic chargers for about $8 on Amazon and I took my stylus from the old phone. Overall happy with the purchase and everything worked great. Only downside in the whole experience for me was that I lost some of my contacts in the transfer. I believe that some are stored locally on the phone and some are google contacts. There didn't seem to be much rhyme or reason but I now make sure that I store them all as Google contacts..",2017年4月18日 在美国审核

So far so good!,"So far I LOVE it!Just got it a few days ago, but already easily adjusted to the screen size (which was my biggest concern).It's really only a little bigger than my old phone -- Droid Razr.They have a function that makes it easier to use with one hand if you like, but I find I can still reach around and do most things with a little stretch (I have small/average hands).The stylus is really AWESOME, especially that I can take notes in lecture and not have to worry about my hand making marks on the screen when I rest it (which was a huge problem with my ipad).With the stylus and the S note app (comes pre-installed), I can write in it as clear and naturally as in a paper notebook (huge bonus when it comes to storing notes, and wishing I had them to refer back to years later but didn't want to store those notebooks forever).No gripes yet, but I'm pretty vocal.If I come up with one, I'll post it!Oh, and HUGE tip from the verizon lady -- the old chargers WORK!The plug is totally different, and supposedly the included charger will charge it faster, but the older plugs actually fit and charge the phone!So happy I don't have to get all new accessories (car charger and more wall chargers for work and home).Recommend this one over the S4 -- does the same stuff, but bigger with a little more functionality (supposedly the processor is faster too).",2013年12月29日 在美国审核

Best phone I've ever owned,"This phone does everything I could ask of it. I'm a student and this thing is absolutely amazing for taking notes, editing documents, reading...etc. I also love to play games which it will handle everything out there. I would not say that this phone is for everybody because of its shear size and capabilities...my 60 year old father would not be able to figure this thing out because of all the customization it offers. Beware, this phone is extremely big...like comically big. Unless you have Andre The Giant hands, you probably wont be able to reach from one end of the screen to the other while one handed texting, with that being said, I am always worried that I will drop it; so i suggest always using both hands. I am a very heavy user so the battery usually lasts me about an entire day with about 15% left, but I like my brightness maxed out, wifi on, games, syncing, blah blah blah. My old Galaxy S3 would require a charge in the middle of the day just to make it to the end of the day with how much I use it.TL;DR I love this phone and would recommend it to anybody who needs to multitask and often burns through their battery during the day.",2014年4月4日 在美国审核

Beautiful Phone. Well worth the money. You won't regret it.,"Quick reference review: (details below)Fantastic all around! beautifully crisp screen in full HD, very quick response time for all around performance from texts to apps to games. Battery life is astounding, average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery, or even two. Connection on Verizon is fast, for both Data and Calls. I haven't experience any call quality issues. Camera qualities are second to none. The S-pen is a nice feature to have. Phone layout/buttons is easy to get used too. I can use this phone easily with one hand, but I have big hands in general. If your only issue with this phone is its size, GET IT. You easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands).Comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as I can.Bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and I am not at all dissatisfied. Worth noting, I purchased this phone over the LG G2. I do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that.Design:The layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. While it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. The materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. In my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microSD in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body.The phone itself is incredibly thin. I purchased a Spigen slim hardcase for the phone because I wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. Button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too.Hardware:This phone is fast. All the benchmark tests do not lie. This thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen Samsung Galaxy Tab. I like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. Great on WiFi or LTE. Screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. Buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. The speakers are good, not great. They get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. If you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. Touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. I've had no issues.UI and software:If you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. If you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. I always recommend it over iOS, But I don't have enough experience with Windows to sway you from it. But the User Interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. There are so many customization's. From different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or OCD personalities.Camera:So many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. I will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. From action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragramthis phone with suffice for most! I always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a DSLR!Size:The size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. As I mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, JUST GET IT. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. Depending on your size, it will be easier than others. The average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. For reference I am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. I'm always amazed how often I don't even feel it. However, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. My honest opinion is find one in person. I went to BestBuy and the Samsung rep allowed me to hold his work Note3.I was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. I love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience.Battery Life:It's amazing. The big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. So even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. If i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. But idle in your pocket with LTE on all day. You'll have no issues. The USB 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. This thing charges so fast. I can get a full charge in half the time as my old HTC Thunderbolt. People complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. Which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone...My only complaint:I had a few issues charging my phone. At first I was extremely upset as I thought the port inside my phone was defective. Essentially, with the USB 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. The standard USB port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. My issue was that one of the 2 connections on the USB3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. This lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me ""Please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging"". I simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. I recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord, as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord, was slightly bent.On the other side, its worth noting you CAN indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro USB cords, however it will be slow.Overall, JUST GET THIS PHONE. I can't state it enough, it is really a fantastic phone. I fought back and forth whether to get this or the LG G2 for cheaper, but I decided I wanted the best phone I could buy (at ~$250 for the best phone on the market? that's fairly priced) and would last me a long time, and more importantly keep me preoccupied, and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade.",2014年3月27日 在美国审核

Love this phone!,"How many ways can I say I LOVE THIS PHONE!!I needed a new phone because my other Verizon phone was on its way out. I did not want to sign up for another two year contract nor did I want to ""rent"" a phone for the next two years. So while doing my research and asking around, I came to discover that this phone is capable of having the battery changed. Well, that was a great selling point since my previous phone was only lasting half a day without needing to be recharged. Unfortunately, many phones today cannot have their batteries replaced when they are getting older,that is why the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was so appealing to me.In addition, I am no youngster and need a big screen to see and this phone is perfect for that. It feels great in my hands and so far I am really enjoying using it. It was a great choice!",2016年2月13日 在美国审核
Love the phone!!!,"First of all, I want to say that Amazon price beats any service provider offers out there.Secondly, the quick shipment from amazon and processing is awesome.Now the phone, I love love love everything about it.It is big in size, but how many people have a smartphone plus a tablet.I find this phone serves the purpose of both.I love how everything is in one. I was always in love with the Android operating system, so I never really had much of a problem.I found I got really frustrated with Apple products a lot, and switching to the iPhone was the biggest regret I had made.I just don't like how everything is set up for you and you can't really customize anything.Secondly, I love how the Note syncs with my Google account, from my Gmail to my calendar and my contacts.I am currently taking online classes, and I am able to log on to my school website without a problem.As opposed to my iPhone I can only access certain features, and not to mention constantly having to zoom in.Cons: speaker is on the bottom, so if you watch a movie in landscape, you'll feel like your hearing is off.That's all I can find for it for now.",2014年4月24日 在美国审核
A great phablet that's much better than its OS.,"The Note 3 is a great rendition of the Android operating system; it's only shortcomings are really from the OS, not the hardware.Physically, it doesn't feel as big as its size, compared to other phones on the market, and Samsung has added some of their own tweaks to make the size even less of an issue - my biggest complaint is that too many of the apps, and the interface itself, simply make everything bigger on the big screen, rather than taking advantage of the size to include more usable content ... there's no reason why a screen this size still only has 4 columns of app icons! But there are other front-ends available that remedy that situation, making the Note 3 an even better tool.The phone works well, but its interface is just about the worst I've seen; again, it's an OS issue, and Android needs to 'borrow' some ideas from HP's excellent-but-defunct WebOS. Connectivity has been excellent, both 4G and Wi-Fi; the 13MP camera is outstanding, the S-Pen makes editing, sketching and note-taking a breeze.",2014年11月16日 在美国审核

Too fragile for me,"I was really excited to get this phone - my old one was really doggin it.My husband had gotten one earlier and really likes his.After having it for about a month, one day red started showing on the screen and then got really bad.Verizon said that it was cracked.It was never dropped or mistreated.He replaced it and we thought it was just an unusual occurrance. Well, the second day after I bought mine I was squeezing the sides as I pushed the buttons to raise the volume and suddenly noticed that it had cracks across the screen.Then the screen went black.I hadn't even had the thing three whole days.I started reading of other people having problems with the screen cracking and having to replace this screen multiple times.So I immediately returned this and will not be getting this model.",2014年11月10日 在美国审核
Great phone. Have had it over a month now ...,"Great phone.Have had it over a month now and am extremely pleased with the Note 3.I had the Samsung Galaxy S III and was 2 yrs old.Was time to upgrade.The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a solid reputation and rather than wait for the Note 4 with no track record I opted for the Note 3.Glad I did.Only one caveat I have found is do not buy a protective case that has a magnetic closure tab because that can interfere with the note hand writing function. Have had no issues getting used to thise phablet sized phone.In fact I find I'm preferring it because the screen is larger, makes texting much easier.Camera is surprisingly good for indoor photos but finding it's not as great for brightly lit scenes such as taking shots of landscapes using auto.Better off using the manual settings for that.",2014年10月16日 在美国审核

It does allow for split screen and doing multiwork. For example I can split screen and have txt messages on one side and web browser on the other. I can also get on the internet and search something while talking on the phone with someone.And don't forget the stylus! I had some people tell me it was gimmicky but I really like it.

"Great screen and battery life, that's it.","Purchased this for my mom since she loves the giant screen and has a hard time reading small font. However, IMO, between the screen and battery life, that's all I like about this phone. I hate Samsung's bloatware, joke of a UI, and their build construction. Coming from several years of using Apple products and now the new HTC One M8, the Samsung phones feel like children toys. To be fair, there are some intuitive features about the Note 3 (use of stylus) but I just can't stand how much bloatware is on this thing. If it were my phone, I would have returned it already. But since I've had to help teach my mom how to use this thing, well, maybe the UI is better off for someone like her. The smartphone is fully functional in it's condition, but if you are like me and want a pure android feel, stay clear from this phone.",2014年9月21日 在美国审核

Fast with features! :-),"Love, love love! So you would have to want a big phone. I carry a purse so it doesn't bother me at all. I love the huge screen. I actually watch shows on &amp; it's comfortable it doesn't really feel like it's a phone. I mainly upgraded from the NoteII for the camera which I use everyday to capture kids/moments. For that alone it is a big improvement (8mb to 13mb + a bunch more modes &amp; controls). There are voice commands &amp; New S pen capabilities. So it is worth it for me because I use all of them a lot. If you are torn between the note 2 or note 3 I would go with the 3. You will have for 2 years &amp; the technology is worth it.

Now that I own it, all of my friends and family want one!The look and feel of the phone is amazing!The size of the screen is awesome!I also love how you can 'hand write your text messages with your stylus pen, or you can hand write and have it automatically convert to a block style message or you can still use the keyboard if you like!I always hand write my text messages as I've never liked using a keyboard. I also love that I can jot down notes with my stylus pen, I use this feature a LOT for my work.The speakers sound GREAT - when listening to music, the mix of tones is crisp and clean while blending beautifully!I use my phone ALL of the time, and the battery life is AMAZING and especially compared to all of my previous phones!I can't say enough GOOD about this phone.I've owned it for a month now and still haven't even touched on all of the great features this phone has!I hope they come out with a Galaxy Note (4) in a few years because there is no doubt that will be my next phone!Thanks AMAZON!

The size of the screen and quality or clarity it has kept me away from my computer. I basically do almost everything with this phone.What separates it from other phones is the ability to take notes using the included S Pen with ease. You can actually write down something on the notepad and let you link it to something else. For example, you can write down someone's phone and click on it to initiate the dial keypad.Or write a website or physical address and click on that to bring up a browser or a Google map to navigate. Basically there is no other phone that competes with galaxy note 3 in this regard. With the auto correction feature when typing something, it is difficult to have typos in what you are writing. The thing that follows your eye when reading to help you scroll works but not sure how to make it do that on purpose. It just does it every now and then. When reading small prints, you can hover over the content with a finger and it magnifies the content. A lot of cool features I have yet to figure out.The battery life is great.It has a good size battery that lasts more than a day with normal use.

My wife's phone will not charge anymore, no matter what cord we use. All other phones you have to jiggle the cord and have it placed in certain way to charge and then it takes way too long to charge.This is an obvious manufacture defect. One phone I can understand, but four phones or actually five if you count the one that was replaced. That is unnaceptable and poor quality control and design on Samsung's part.

I dont think that this is a problem with the phone but just a byproduct of its aging (3 year old) componants. But these things only happened twice in the last month after heavy usage so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Overall, getting this phone with its processing power and display was a very good deal for under $200. Despite its age it functions are fluid and dont seem to be slowing down at the moment.

Cool phone!,"I finally had to break down and purchase a new phone to replace the flip I had been using for about 10 years.I chose this because it was highly rated by all the reviews I read and I absolutely refused to be a moronic lemming and purchase an iPOS.The price through Amazon was better than what I could do through Verizon and the setup was absolutely painless.I am NOT too thrilled about the $50 increase in my monthly bill, but that's what you get for going from a no-frills flip phone to a ""phablet"".",2014年3月22日 在美国审核
"love, love","love, love, LOVE this phone. It was cheaper on here then buying it through Verizon. I received it quickly and was able to quickly and easily get it set up. This phone works great, I haven't had any major problems with it. The only problems I have had are typical phone problems like it freezing up on me; but after taking the battery out and turning it back on it is fine again and that hasn't even happened as often as other phones I've had. My previous phone was the LG G2, I think the Note 3 is a million times better.",2015年9月16日 在美国审核
Very Nice capabilities and very future proof,"Finally after years of waiting, a phone with practically everything that I want and need seems to be here.I've had this phone for over 2 months and it has a Large and high quality display yet easy to hold in one hand, powerful (future proof), long battery life, good sound quality and clarity on both speakers, Infrared TV remote, good camera, USB 3.0 speeds, support for latest wireless standards and optional SD card. I hope bug/performance fixes get released in a timely manner unlike with my Verizon GNexus.Might need to be patient and give the phone a few days—I got a replacement and for the 1st 3 or 4 charges the battery would drain easily to 50% after 9 hours of usage and I was not even using the same amount of features as with the 1st phone nor even using it as much, but it improved over time.The 1st phone did not have this issue and right out of the box would have only dropped to 80% after the same usage and only dropped 2% or 3% overnight instead of 4% to 6% like with the current one.Positives:Battery LifeCharge TimesScreen SizeSound Quality of both speakers -- so nice not to hear chipmunks anymoreSignal Quality (wifi and LTE)Camera Quality in decent lightingPhone stays cool during heavy usage (gaming, phone calls, etc)Overall Keyboard LayoutNegatives:Intermittent unexplained battery drainage—Maybe NSA is spying on me? :)Auto-corrections on native keyboardThe way that the Phone and Contacts features work—should be simpler to use with a screen this size but requires 2 hands or might be more suited to left-handed people with large handsIntermittent TouchWiz feature malfunctions (s voice, gestures, 1 handed mode, etc)Inability to remember audio settings for head set and constant prompts about volume safety--I only use audio jack while in the car connected to a cassette adapter (not earphones) since I don't have Bluetooth or any native support for smart phones in my car.Some Notes:TouchWiz adds much needed functionality to native android that is nice, but I’ve turned off a lot of the features because some were overkill for my needs and too unreliable for every-day use.I only have prior experience with Native android and Cyanogenmod and although I prefer TouchWiz over Native android, it still needs some serious work.For instance, I find that the swipe to the left or right to message or call a contact works intermittently along with some of the other advertised features such as Smart Stay, S Voice, Hand Gestures, etc, so I’ve turned most of them off and only enable some while using hands free mode while driving or at home.It is also more difficult to do some of the most basic of tasks using TouchWizBattery Life and charge times with stock charger is very nice although at times since I got my replacement Note 3 it seems like something drains the battery much faster than with the 1st one—going to eventually reset phone to see if it is some kind of OS malfunction.With normal drainage I can usually go for 2 or 3 days on a single charge with what I consider moderate usage (Hangouts chatting, phone calls, iHeartRadio, gaming, and watching videos).Considering that I have a larger screen than I had before, use more of the phone’s features and for longer periods of time while running TouchWiz; I’m impressed.The battery is not even 2x the capacity of my GNexus which would have required 2 charges daily with the same kind of usage on Native android or Cyanogenmod.The screen is fantastic and I’ve enjoyed watching both 1080p and 720p videos without problems—native player can handle most video formats, but does NOT have the same support for audio encoding.Phone feels light weight and although it is aesthetically pleasing to look at, the materials feel kind of cheap so I’ve invested in a cheap case to prolong the aesthetics.Things that I don’t like:I currently know 2 other people who’ve bought this phone and 1 of them along with myself had to get replacements.My 1st one had issues with USB3.0 connectivity, a faulty charging cable, strange tapping sound during phone calls, and a few other bugs.The other party had issues with the charging port—not sure if the 3rd person had issues.My friend that always buys Samsung phones says that the issues with charging ports are common, but this is only my 2nd Samsung phone so I cannot say for sure if this is the case.Auto-correct and word suggestions on native keyboard are a pain to use and so unnatural.I’m used to pressing the back key to have my words reset to what I initially typed in the event that auto-correct is not needed, but with this keyboard you are sometimes presented with a undo button and sometimes you just have to get creative and use the Sym button or write with the stylus pen to bypass the auto-corrections—this is a major flaw in my opinion and should have been fixed by now considering that several updates have been released for the apps and the phone itself.Should not take so much effort to type on a touch screen phone.Hopefully Apple hasn't patented this feature.As with my Galaxy Nexus, the auto screen brightness is too dim for standard use.Not sure how well it would prolong battery life for those who walk around a-lot while using their phones.Stylus is hard to remove—good that it won’t fall out on accident though. Surprisingly, it has not damaged any of my nails.Interestingly, my protection case makes removing the stylus very easy--You go Cimo S-Line CaseIn order to use USB 3.0, it has to switch to airplane mode--transfers don’t last very long at these speeds anyway and it has a built in feature to turn back on USB 2.0 mode if 5 minutes go by and USB 3.0 is not being used.This feature can also be problematic if you try to let Windows Convert a video file to be transferred to the phone which would take more than 5 minutes.Wall charger has USB port on the side of the wall unit which too me is an invite for bent prongs considering that it is recommended that you remove it to save power and it wastes a port on a lot of Surge suppressors.",2014年2月15日 在美国审核

"Screw any iPhone 5, 5C, 5S ....

Steve Jobs. Sadly he is gone and apple will never be the same) get the GALAXY NOTE 3!!! Yes it does suck a little because you don't have seamless integration via other Mac products. Guess what? Who cares?! This is a far superior phone and I could go into specs but just read the reviews because I'm too lazy to write them. I had a 4s for two years, then got the 5s and was disappointed to them max!Fix the freakin' aspect ratio you fools. This is the third iPhone 5 and they still fell flat. Pathetic. Truly unacceptable. It's not even 16x9. Why? Yep, no Steve Jobs. This is rudimentary and Apple still doesn't get it. Unacceptable. So I got the Note 3. This baby will blow you away. And if you get a wallet case (Cellto wallet case is awesome) then it is not that bad at all to put up to your ear. It begins to not feel like a tablet (which is beneficial because this pretty much is a tablet too). Amazing Phone. Proud of Samsung for getting it together and delivering! And then some. Love the Pen as I am a filmmaker and just creative :) GET IT!!!! I realize most out there aren't tech save. So have fun with your iPhone. The Galaxy Note 3 combines both worlds. Technicality and user friendliness. Don't believe or don't care? Have fun with an inferior phone. And I love Apple. Always have had both PC and Mac computers. But innovation will never match what Steve Jobs did for Apple. He laid out the blueprints for multiple devices to the world to expand on. I guess Apple didn't get the memo. Clearly. They've reached their pinnacle and can only attempt to catch up to what was already handed to them. Again, pathetic. Disappointing. If you're serious in getting a great phone, buy the Note 3.

Amazon Wireless and VZW,"To preface the entire review, i was researching this device with VZW for over 2 months.Amazon has always had the lowest price, verizon couldn't even come close to matching it.The process was tedious for me because i was adding my line to a family plan and did not have the account holders driver license number and some other information. When trying to go through the process VZW customer service verified who I was and had the ability to make changes on the account but would not tell me the information I needed.Luckily the Amazon rep was on the phone with me and was able to help facilitate what I needed.While I was on the phone with VZW, at two separate points they tried to steal the sale from Amazon but could only offer discounts in accessories (which amazon was still beating their discounted pricing).After finally receiving my phone two days later, I tried activating my device.I spent over 4 hours on the phone with different VZW reps to help activate the device. No one could help me.I guess what happened was someone at verizon had my order set to be activated the following day, but they ported my number from sprint already.I was without service for almost 1 whole day.The following day was Thanksgiving when I needed to activate it, but VZW's support number was closed due to the holiday.Luckily i was able to connect with someone at Amazon who had a direct contact number, who was able to force my activation and get my phone up and running.If it wasnt for Amazon I would have been down an entire two plus days without a phone.After buying the device at $199.99 on Nov 26, I found the device price was lowered.I called amazon and since it was within 30 days of purchase they are refunding me the $50 difference.Which increased the monetary value for Amazon wireless even further!The only down side (besides hours on the phone trying to activate) was the fact that although I ordered the protection plan through VZW when ordering with Amazon, Verizon had no record of that.As long as it is within the first 30 days you can call VZW to add it.I had read a previous review that said that, which made me double check a week later after activation.All in All, i had a lot of hiccups with the process, but the Amazon wireless customer service made right by everything I went though and was a pleasure to work with and well deserving of my business.I will definitely go through amazon for my next mobile purchase.",2013年12月15日 在美国审核
What Battery Life!,"After 6 days, 37% battery remaining; that's pretty amazing! My last phone (Droid Bionic) lasted two days max.Alright, I'm not a really heavy user. I check email a couple of times a day. I make 6-10 phone calls a day. I do some web browsing when away from my desktop computer and run a few apps. OTOH, I'm often connected to wifi (at home or away). Bluetooth is off right now, so that probably saves some juice.What I miss from the Droid was the availability of dedicated docks for car and desk. But it would overheat in the windshield dock, which I'm hoping won't happen with the Note 3. One other negative I've noticed is the placement of the power button opposite the volume rockers. I have to be careful to only press the power switch.I'm a 6' tall guy and the size of this is not a problem. I chose it as a way to have a single device rather than carry a tablet in addition to my phone. Carrying it in a pocket of a travel vest is no problem. I think it would be too large to carry on a belt.The camera seems to perform like a phone camera: OK in good light only. At a dimly-lit party with flash on produced smeared images due to excess in-device noise reduction.Love the size for browsing my calendar and email. Web browsing is better than on a phone, but not really competition for a tablet.Just getting accustomed to the S Pen and find it better than a conventional stylus. Have barely scratched the surface of the extra functions.Speaking of just scratching the surface, I find that I'm going to have to set aside time to partake of some tutorials in order to really get the most out of the Note 3. My first smart phone was a Blackberry six years ago, then I graduated to the Droid Bionic. The power of this phone -- plus features of Android 4.3 -- encourage me to learn to live up to what it can do.Since this is my only portable device, I went for a SanDisk Extreme 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I memory card, which brings my total available storage close to 100 GB ... might as well be equipped to take maximum advantage of this beast.",2013年12月18日 在美国审核
Love It but...Apps,"I switched from iPhone to this Android phone and love the bigger screen, the HD video &amp; display, the camera is decent though not as good as I expected (pixelation and spotty, but does excellent video even in dark locations such as a night club), the dual video capture is fun to play with (2 screens in one video showing the person in the scene being recorded for example), it comes loaded with general apps, no games. However I've had problems with it on many google services such as Hangouts and Youtube sharing, many games and apps aren't supported on Android, the battery is quickly used up and it takes a couple hours to charge from zero to 100%. I've hardly used the pen, but I love the design for holding the pen inside the phone body, it is secure and never loosens so far. I don't like the design of having the off button opposite the volume button as it took forever to learn how to push one without pushing them both. Holding the phone on the bottom is awkward because of the menu buttons so it took some time to find a way to hold it. All in all I'd recommend it even to 1st time users of smart phones, it's very easy to set up and use, and for experienced users, to customize.",2014年2月18日 在美国审核

"Great phone, ridiculously great screen - but has keyboard annoyances that Motorola does not.","This phone is pure awesome. End of story. Lightning fast, full 1080p screen (which is mind-blowingly clear) - this phone has a lot going for it.However, Motorola has Samsung crushed when it comes to user-friendliness regarding typing. Let's face it - everyone gets annoyed now and again with auto-correct. But at least Motorola's auto-correct is intuitive, and understands when it changes ""Staind"" to ""Stained"" - and you go back to change it back to ""Staind"" because it's actually what you meant....Motorola understands ""OK, you really meant to spell it that way...we'll let it go.""Samsung corrects you again.And even better, on a Motorola Droid - when you hit ""backspace"" after an auto-correct, it changes ""Stained"" back to ""Staind"" because it realizes you actually meant it that way. And, again on a Motorola, when you hit ""Sym"" to get your comma, then you hit comma, when you hit the spacebar to go to the next word - the keyboard changes back from symbols to letters for you. On Samsung, you have to hit ""Sym"" again to return to the qwerty keyboard.Minor things...I know....but it's very surprising Samsung gets these things wrong. I'd think by now, they would've had time to realize these inconveniences in their keyboard programming, and fix them for us.Maybe someday....Regardless....the phone is a true power-house of performance.Handling every multi-tasking thing you can throw at it, without skipping a beat and still begging for more.",2013年12月23日 在美国审核
