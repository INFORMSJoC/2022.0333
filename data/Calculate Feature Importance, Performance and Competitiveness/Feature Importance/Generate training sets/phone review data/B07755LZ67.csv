happy girl.,"i was so scared to order a $600 8 plus off amazon and after reading some of the reviews it made me a lil more scared. i just got my phone in the mail today and it came in a nice little assorted box with a charger and everything. i took the phone out it already had a screen protector on so that was a plus, i cut it on and activated it with no problem, and so far it’s working perfectly fine, just like new. so far so great :) thank you buyspry or however u spell it lol ",2019年1月8日 在美国审核
100/5!,"i always buy my phones on amazon. it's always cheaper and more convenient. i have since upgraded to the xs max, but i loved this phone when i had it. there were absolutely no flaws when i received it (cracks, dents, scratches, etc). it looked and operated like a brand new iphone. all of the switches, touch id, cameras, etc worked perfectly fine. i used this with straight talk and had no issues putting my sim card in and getting signal.one thing to note is that you will have to buy your own headphone adapter (they're about $9 on apple's website) if you don't have airpods/wireless headphones since the headphone jack is now gone. the package only included a white box, the phone in protective films, a couple of info papers, and a charger.overall, i'm extremely happy with my purchase and i will buy again if the time arises.",2018年9月12日 在美国审核

Perfect 4.7  (**4 UPDATE IN DESCRIPTION**),"Honestly, I was a little hesitant/skeptic about buying a device let alone a smart device on Amazon especially cuz it said something about 1897 in the title of the name. It was supposed to come around 8pm but arrived 7 hours earlier. No scratches. Came with 99% battery capacity. Surprisingly it’s actually an apple device lmao, and it works with Metro PCS. Only thing is Idk about everyone else but I would say it’s more of a cream color than a gold, and my only concern is, it’s rebooted/restarted (turned off then back on) randomly twice since I got it not sure what it means cuz I don’t think it’s stuck in a boot loop because it’s up-to-date on all updates, but maybe it was nothing ♂ Idk lol but overall I’d say 5/5 MMMAYBE 4.5 lmao<br>(SC/IG; Sp3ctre.Wolf)UPDATE: 3 stars(if not 2.7♂)Yhhh so it'll be a week that I've had this now by tomorrow. But everytime I try and use the camera now through the original software (say for portrait mode, slow mo, video, etc or even open the app at all for that matter) it reboots, like every single time- to the point to where I'm contemplating why this is even a thing. Idk if I should return it, bring it in for a diagnosis or what, but if anyone can help me with this please let me know, ♂ Thanks in advance (COULD) be the recent update “bootloop”)*UPDATE UPDATE* 2 weeks after purchaseSo it would turn out that it WAS the phone (apple) and not the seller (obviously) because of the recent 12.4 update♂. I was experimenting with different settings, to see what could’ve triggered it until I tried force rebooting the phone consecutively until I thought it had enough lol. So far I think it’s fixed but if not, ig I’ll update again ♂ lmao.</br>",2019年8月16日 在美国审核
Nice price but battery life is a little depressing.,Phone came in pristine condition. Not one scratch or ding.

Very surprised in the best way!,"I was hesitant on ordering a new unlocked phone from Amazon but I’m honestly!! I’m glad I did , it really surprised me when it came down to how clean the iphone looked (8Plus) . It didn’t come with a legit iPhone charger but it still came with an alternative. I have plenty of other iPhone chargersso it didn’t bother me I just needed the iphone. Since it was my first time trying this out i thought the iphone I bought wasn’t unlocked at first because when I would put my Metro PCS SIM Card in the SIM card holder of the new phone in the top left corner it would still read [No SIM].So that’s when I took it upon myself to look on YouTube &amp; get down to the reason why , and YouTube was helpful! I figured out that I had to call my phone carrier and let them know I wanted to switch to a new phone using my current SIM Card, and all they needed was basic information from me as far as my account info and also the IMEI # of the new iphone I purchased! &amp; keep in mind there is a fee for switching over that will be added to your next phone bill or right then while talking to a representative , if you have Metro PCS my fee came to $55 &amp; some change..So after that was taken care of I just took my SIM Card out of my old iphone and placed it in the SIM Card holder of the new iphone &amp; next thing I know everything worked out fine! I do recommend that you have all your passwords for your Apple ID /Apps ready along with having your iphone backed up so it will be easy to do a simple transfer I hope this helps someone who’sthinking about purchasing a phone from Amazon!",2020年4月21日 在美国审核

It is locked to AT&amp;T but all I had to do was take the SIM card out of my old AT&amp;T iPhone and put it into this one. I made sure to backup everything to iCloud before I took the sim out and I’m glad I did! I was able to start this phone with no problems and it now is set up identically to my old phone all my photos and apps are here and it looks amazing!! It did however, as I noticed in previous reviews, come with only 10% battery charged and a off brand charger. That didn’t really bother me though because for the price this was 100% worth it!

Happy with the purchase,"My old IPhone 8+ is 4 years old and battery started to die very fast. In addition I had a problem with my screen, since it fell down countless times and only because of protective shield, the glass stayed in place. Lately, I noticed that the screen actually has multiple cracks and I really need to change the screen and the battery. The cost of repair is very high and could be around $300-450, if not more. Also, I was not ready to spent $900 for a new phone, and I love my 8+. So, I decide to buy a refurbished. The package was delivered literally in two days and it's in great condition. The set up and backup upload was easy-peasy. I keep my fingers crossed that this phone would last.

"In 2022, iPhone 8 Plus is still a solid option","Seller: BMOF86ST<br><br>Use YouTube for an actual device review. This entry is for the purchase experience on Amazon.Received phone in 3 days.Scratches on the back especially on the bottom corner— this is the worst part of the review. I have it in a case all the time, so this doesn’t bother me. The outer frame has scratches as well, but again it’s in a case for me. Everywhere else was absolutely fine—- zero cracks, 100% functional. The screen (the most important part) looks brand spanking new. Touch ID is better than FaceID imo. Charger and cable were generic aftermarket, but they work fine. Screen again, looked and felt brand new- either a high quality aftermarket screen or a refurbished oem. It looks great either way. The box was a generic that they probably use for all their used phones. For $220 shipped, this phone is still a great value for those who don’t need all the new stuff. Battery life cycle remaining was 83%- meaning the majority of the battery life capacity was still good.As a basic use smart phone- web browsing, email, watching/streaming videos, music, radio, small games—— it’s fine. Buy it.Review one month later—- device is still fine, battery still strong. I’m happy.</br></br>",2022年5月5日 在美国审核

Took a risk on Amazon Certified Refurbished and SO GLAD WE DID,"Phones are WILDLY, INSANELY expensive and buying new was not an option for us. We both rocked our 5S iPhones until this past Christmas (the Verizon reps were genuinely shocked when we took the new ones in to change over) when it was not possible to keep them functioning (the home button no longer worked, storage was a daily issue, etc). We had never bought Amazon Certified Refurbished before and we are SO glad we took the gamble. They came in perfect condition and have been working perfectly; battery life, functionality, the whole nine. Will update if something goes south, but we're covered under warranty for the first 6 months, so even still we should be ok.

I checked every rating, comparison and cons on this phones outside of the reviews listed in Amazon by other purchasers...this is the top rated back model other the XR in Apples line.

I’ll change it whenever.Other than that, great phone. Love it! Shipping was quicker than was told.

My review of this purchase.,"IP8 Plus works great. I have only had it less than a week. I was a little uneasy spending $450 on a refurbished phone but I did and I am very happy so far and I saved some money buying this refurbished unit as opposed to a brand new iphone.

Great Buy - works on the Comcast System,"I have now had this phone for a month and just wanted to make sure it performed as expected - it does and it exceeded expectations.I had been looking for an iphone8plus for a while and thought the way to go would be to grab one up after Christmas on Craigslist.Craigslist can be a nightmare, but my biggest problem was knowing whether or not an ""unlocked"" phone would work on the Comcast system.There was not too much data out there in regards to this.Comcast piggybacks on Verizon to my understanding, so I thought an unlocked Verizon phone would work, but I was not sure.Short story long, I bought this phone since my wife gave me an Amazon gift card for $100 (it's either that or Home Depot) so that buffered the cost.With the knowledge of a 90 day warranty and confirmation from the seller it would work on Comcast (if not I could return it)I decided to take the plunge.The phone arrived in short order and was well package, and the battery was charged.It looked for all purposes to be branded new.I think that may be the difference between ""renewed' vs ""reconditioned"".Anyway, I slippedthe SIMS card in and everything worked as expected.Not knowing all the advantages going from a 6plus to an 8plus - the new phone told me to place next to the old phone and it downloaded the data in about 3 minutes and everything was there and worked as expected (no wires no nothing).Anyway, I enjoy the phone and went from a phone with 16GB to 256 Gb of memory (what luxury).I would highly recommend buying a phone from the seller.",2020年2月12日 在美国审核

iPhone 8 Plus!!!,The phone came in the mail 2 days late but I don’t think that was the sellers fault - other than that I’m very happy with my purchase! You can’t beat the price. There’s just one little scuff on the right bottom edge but other than that this refurbished phone seems brand new. The phone came completely dead but I don’t really mind that I just charged it - the battery life came at 92% I can’t complain! I think it’s definitely worth buying a refurbished phone over a new one if you’re looking to save money. I felt mostly safe buying this because of the 90 day warranty Amazon Renewed promised. The camera works well I can’t find anything wrong with it so far - if I do I will update my review. Thanks CR Land!,2019年7月31日 在美国审核

At first I thought I was going to be scammed and that I was going to get a smart phone other then the iPhone 8 Plus that I ordered, how ever when it arrived I was really impressed and still is as this is a big upgrade for me as an owner of an iPhone 6. Definitely would say this is worth your money. Also I was impressed because I got an iPhone case for it fir free. Thank you!!! ",2020年10月21日 在美国审核
Love this Iphone 8+,"I was really surprised that it took only a couple of days to receive my Phone 8+.It came with a power supply and cord and looked brand new.I was able to charge it - update it and found all I had to do to set it up was keep it next to the old phone.The new phone popped up with a app asking me if I wanted to transferred all my information and apps from the old phone over to the new phone..To be safe I did save a backup to iCloud - then turned off Icloud and ""Find my phone"" on the old unit.After about 30 minutes the process completed.Then I moved the Sim card over to the new phone and I had service.All in all it was rather painless to upgrade and I did not have to wait in line at the phone store.",2020年11月1日 在美国审核

iPhone 8 Plus (64),"Wow! What a bargain. Purchase price was $400.I took it to an APPLE store and they agreed on the excellence of this product.

great phone,"i know i might not sway your opinion but im just telling you go for it. if you looking for a somewhat new phone this is perfect. i did have issues before since i bought a tmobile locked and i thought ""it should work, sprints tmobile"" but thats not true since when this phone was manufactured that wasnt the case so its locked to actual tmobile ACCOUNTS it doesnt matter if you have a tmobile or sprint sim card. mind you the phone was perfect only a little scratching on the corners of the phone but you cant see that with a phone case anyways. so i returned that phone and got a full refund *including tax* and bought an unlocked phone as tmobile said to do and i havent put my sim in yet but i looked in my settings and its not locked to any sim so it should swim smoothly. again when i bought the phone i got the charger, box, but this time i didnt get a screen protector but i think that varies based on who you buy from. this phones battery health is not as good as the other one but its still above 80% *83* anyways this phone is great so far and yeah would buy again.TL;DR: great phone, no complaints about the phone itself",2021年7月3日 在美国审核

IPhone 8 DECIDE FOR YOURSELF,"I was definitely Skeptical about purchasing a phone off the Internet and I’m a little upset that I did as well.

For the money I paid I’ve only had the phone close to six months and I already can’t hear out of the speaker, The home button vibrates and makes this weird noise which is annoying when opening the phone or even to close a app, The music plays very low and the phone is always freezing and as I stated I only had the phone less than six months. If anything I would say go to store and purchase your phone that way you know your getting a good refurbished phone that can be fixed or replaced if something goes wrong. I would like to have a replacement or a refund if possible in it’s entirety.",2020年3月4日 在美国审核

Excellent condition and very happy!,"I was amazed how good the condition was opening the box. The iPhone works perfectly like it's brand new. I was also surprised that there was also a new screen protector applied to the phone's screen too. There's only minor wear and tear around the camera bezel and one little scratch next to the power button on the side. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. Just as others have said in their reviews the iPhone doesn't come with headphones and it comes in a generic smartphone box and it did come with a generic charger that works just fine.",2019年11月29日 在美国审核
Scam!! Used phone scratched screen not unlocked from previous network.,I would not buy this product. I ordered it thinking that the refurbished it with new screen and new battery like normal refurbish. It looks to me they never even open the phone up. There are scratches all over the screen because whoever had it before did not use a screen protector. Also the battery life is at 83%. This is not a referb phone it looks like they get them in and send them right back out with nothing done to it. Scam!!! Update the phone is still locked to another carrier. They make you pay return shipping. I’m going to put this as five Estars so people see it.,2020年12月20日 在美国审核

A solid device at reasonable price.,I liked the overall condition of the refurbished 256GB IPhone 8 Plus that I received. Everything on the preowned refurbished iPhone looks and works great.

Every thing was great besides the ear piece speaker.,"Every thing seems to work very well on this phone.. I was able to move my sim from my crappy temporary android phone and put it into this phone, it worked immediately. I have Verizon. They only flaw is my ear piece speaker is terrible. I can barely hear any one talking even turned up all the way.. it is also very staticky, raspy, rattly when the other person is talking.. and you really can tell the ear piece is crappy when playing music through the phone. I don’t want to deal with returning it so now I have to pay 70$ to replace my ear piece.

Almost two years and still going strong.,"As a luddite and unemployed person, I couldn't exactly buy one of Apple's latest and greatest face-scanning, movie producing, home button-lacking smartphones. So I settled on the last plus sized phone they made with a home button. For anyone who doesn't know, it isn't actually a button but it basically acts like one. Look up iPhone 8 home button for more information. The phone I received was packaged well enough to ship but it certainly wasn't an Apple unboxing. It came with a cable that probably worked with it but I have enough as is so I never really tested it. The phone has very minor scratches on the edges and screen, nothing egregious but large enough to notice every few weeks. It helps to have a case on it to hide a few of the cosmetic blemishes on the sides. The battery also wasn't the best being shipped to me with somewhere between 80-85%. I ended up replacing the battery when the opportunity presented itself and I haven't done anything else to it. I bought this phone to use with Tracfone and it has work totally fine since activating the sim card. In conclusion, if you are looking a phone that won't break the bank and still want to have a home button, this will probably do well enough. I've had this phone for almost two years now and I intend to use it for as long as I can, probably until they stop giving it new iOS updates.",2022年4月9日 在美国审核

Why pay a premium for a phone from your wireless provider?,"This was the first time buying a used refurbished cell phone instead of getting a new one.The reason is simple, the price.The renewed iPhone 8+ came via FedEx a few days after it was ordered, packaged in new box and well protected.The screen already had a glass protector on it but showed no evident scratches.The back of the phone showed no signs of wear either.Came with a generic new, listed as certified charger and cable, did not try those yet.Used an Apple charger and cable to charge it, which was quick.Mirroring the apps, contacts and details from the old iPhone to this one was slick and maybe took 20-30 minutes.It is supposed to come with a sim card removal tool/pin, there was none, but I had one already. Easy to change.Once changed and powered, verified with Verizon rep that the phone was showing up on the network.Battery life is good for a full day's typical use but that can be subjective since everyone uses their phone differently.So far so good, a worthwhile purchase.",2020年11月16日 在美国审核

“Refreshed” doesn’t mean new battery,"Everything is fine, it’s an unlocked phone that doesn’t have any real scratches or dings... but it also doesn’t have a new battery. Battery life said 82%. Guessing their cutoff is 80% for a battery replacement. If I have to bolt on the time and cost of the battery replacement, it’s not cheaper than Apple refurbished... which come with new batteries. Taking it to get a new battery tomorrow at the Apple Store... add on half a day and $100 to the cost. Meh, I’d be thrilled if this had a new battery but as it stands pretty underwhelmed.

Worth what you pay,"I am extremely surprised with this product! Received it two days before it was estimated to arrive. I have never purchased an item that has been refurbished as I have always been wary of authenticity of the product, however everything works great. The camera works great, and the speakers are very loud and clear. My main concern when considering to buy was how I wasn’t able to know the phones physical condition before buying. It seems as though there’s a scuff or small dent in all four corners of the phone but seeing as I am putting a thick case on it they’re not visible and as such I’m not worried about them. I am very glad that there are no scratches whatsoever on the screen, however there were two deep scratches on the back, but luckily no other scratches besides those. It doesn’t seem like there’s any other issues. Overall, I’m pleased with the product, it’d be a 10/10 from me if there wasn’t any physical damage to the phone but overall, I’d rather pay for this than a new phone at full price. I’d buy it again. Also, got authentic charger and charging adapter, unfortunately I didn’t receive any headphones :/ but good purchase all around",2019年6月15日 在美国审核

"BAD BATTERY NOT “LIKE NEW”, IT IS “LIKE USED”!!","This phone was advertised as “renewed” yet when I got it the paint was scratched near the camera lenses and more importantly the battery capacity is under 90%. As I write this review I can see the battery draining. (It went down 5%) This battery was fully charged 5 hours ago. Just sitting there with no activity it went down to 86%, and I just got it yesterday. I called Amazon BEFORE I purchased this phone to find out about this “renewed” program. The Amazon rep stated that “renewed” is like brand new. Well, having scratches near the camera, and a battery capacity that is under 90% is NOT “like new” it is “like used”.I am now noticing a discoloring at the bottom of the screen. This is just another scam like “refurbished” is. I have sent in my refund request. For all the trouble I went through in setting up this phone I could pay 50$ more and go to the Apple Store to get a better phone.",2019年10月9日 在美国审核

READ!!!!!!******DEFECTIVE PHONE/SCAM ALERT!!!!!!!!!!********,"DO NOT PURCHASE FROM SELLER, SELLS DEFECTIVE PHONES... UPDATE 2/27/20- after being unable to get into the phone to delete apple account bc THE PHONE COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING &amp; WOULD NOT TURN ON AT ALL ... they are unable to process a refund... unable to get into apple ID(own fault recovery was linked to old phone number) we are out $400 and the iPhone that has already been returned and IS IN THEIR POSSESSION... COMPLETELY SCAM, had they sold us a functioning phone NONE of this would be happening... reporting to amazon as well. Lesson learned and I SHOULD HAVE listened to the reviews prior to purchasing.We received this phone and within 2 days it shuts off randomly, goes all black, blank or red screen.. when turned back on, all white lines appear all over the phone... about 15 TIMES A DAY (with full battery). Contacted seller to see what we are going to do about this obvious defective phone that was not cheap... hoping to just swap the item purchased for one that is not defective.. stay tuned.**This review is subject to change once a response is received or the issued is resolved** UPDATED 2/27/20",2020年1月12日 在美国审核

Looks like new but buy extended warranty!,"Love the phone, looks like new and great price. Apple store tested it as it “freezes up” which Apple said was due to severely deteriorated battery. Renewed sold by Apple includes a new battery and new case- this seller agreed to reimburse for new battery and case is perfect. I am pleased, must submit the receipt.$49 and it had to be special ordered, 5-day wait. Worth the money but Iphone 8+ still freezes up. Need to go back to Apple techs. Unfortunately Apple does not sell extended warrantees on Renewed phones unless they are the seller. I am just past the 30 days to buy Amazons extended warranty. So if freezing up cannot be resolved I must make a decision quick.",2021年3月8日 在美国审核

This is aftermarket trash,This phone came with a camera that had a busted and cracked glass making all of the photos taken with it come out blurry and unusable. Contacted seller and they FINALLY agreed to pay for the cost of repair after going back and forth. I got it repaired but it did not fix the camera. What I did learn is that every single part of this phone is aftermarket - the tech said that there’s aftermarket parts that he didn’t even know existed. I thought something was fishy about this phone b/c the screen resolution is way lower than my old 7 plus and the keyboard lags. Just really upset and disappointed given the cost of the phone. I am now RETURNING the phone and the seller is fine with it. Thank goodness. Go away GM Deals and stop scamming people with expensive FAKE phones. Please!,2020年10月9日 在美国审核

IPHONE 8 PLUS SOUND DEFECTIVE VERY HARD TO LISTEN AND TALK USING SPEAKER ONLY,The phone was physically in very good condition. Seller sent it in very timely manner and very nicely packaged. I end up returning it and seller issued a refund also in timely manners. Overall the services provided by seller is the best. But unfortunately seller didn't write in description about sound defective. It was almost impossible to talk without turning speaker on. The voice so bad and split kind sometimes very hard for me to understand and others complained same. The button on side used manually to turn sound high also not functioning well enough. When I turned button to highest sound as soon I release it i seen volume gets low automatically again. First I thought to get it fixed on my own using local iphone repair shop but later decided to simply return it. I love iphone 8 plus size its size very nice too. Overall my experience is not good as I wasted my so much time in switching all data setting it up and them cleaning that up switching again to old iphone 5 very frustrating....but will start over. I advise instead of buying refurbished better get some local prepaid services with new phone contract.....,2020年1月8日 在美国审核

Rarely have I been so dissatisfied with an Amazon purchase,"Long story short, found out a code prevents me from turning location services on so NONE OF THE MAPS APPS WORK!! Contacted seller numerous times, told reset phone to factory. SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT NEEDED DOING WHEN YOU SENT TBE PHONE!! Now have no computer to download essential info so it’s not lost during reset, have been traveling for a month with no way to navigate. A MAJOR REASON FOR THIS PURCHASE. Putting my information on the cloud so it’s subject to hacking is not acceptable, your form emails instructing me to do so are not helpful. I want my money back.",2018年9月29日 在美国审核

"Lengthly review but please make sure you read completely,in the end  Apple Rocks!","I got my phone early, looked good no external damage. I activated my phone, no problems (Yet), as it happened my wife was out and called me I put my phone on speaker, I could hear her but she couldn't hear me she was in the store and we attributed it to bad service, she called me again from outside and same issue. When she got home she called me. Again if I had my speaker on I could hear but she couldn't hear me, if she had her speaker on she could hear me but I couldn't hear her. *** I did contact seller through Amazon and they did approve me return the phone sent address labels and everything, they were very much working with me, I really didn't want to wait or go through the time and hassle of returning my phone, but like I said the seller was working with me **** Now, there was an Apple store about 45 minutes away, I made an appointment for them just to check everything was set up correctly for me which it was, they ran a couple of diagnostic test on the phone, 1 result said battery needed to be replaced, 2 said the lower left speaker was bad and needed to be replaced and there was 1 other fault, feeling devastated at this point because your thinking I just bought this phone and have these issues. Well God is good, the tech said that the phone still had Apple care and that everything was covered, the tech said because of all the issues he recommended replacing the phone, as we are talking one of the other employees walks out with a Brand New I Phone and the tech went through with me and activated and set up my New phone and we dumped and reset the old phone back to when I received it. Apple/Apple store in Annapolis, MD you rock!!!!! Got me a Brand New Phone for exchange of bad phone and ZERO DOLLARS!!!!! God is Good!!!! Plus my New phone now also has Apple Care for any future issues! My suggestion to anyone who buys an I Phone through Amazon and has issues like me try your local Apple store, you may get Blessed or lucky like me without the hassle of returning it.",2021年3月9日 在美国审核

Great deal,"This iphone is gorgeous, I hooked it up initially on my existing Tmobile and that was a nightmare upgrading to them. Tried to tell me I had to get a new plan as it was not compatible with this iphone, that was a lie. Sold me a bunch of garbage I didn't want or need and ruined my existing plan. Took 1.5 hours to upgrade me because tmobile people are stupid, wasted my time. Charged me for a new sim card, charged me for an activation fee, charged me to give me a ""free"" tablet, but then gave me no data on my iphone. I returned the free tablet for a restocking fee, was on the phone for 4 hours to Tmobile clear all this up with multiple visits to Tmobile store. So, I switched to Mint with Ryan Reynolds for 1/2 price unlimited text, data, and phone 15.00 per month. The beauty of it was, I didn't need to pay Mint mobile for their new mint sim card, nor did I have to pay an activation fee. They use the Tmobile network. This Tmobile phone worked with mint instantly, that set up could all be done remotely online. for free with noone trying to scam me, give me free tablets, that I had to pay for and return, lie, or sell me cards or activation fee, nor did mint mobile waste my time. This iphone worked perfectly with the new plan and that set up process was a breeze. This iphone is really beautiful. It has been a month since I got it and battery health is at 91%. I am very pleased with this purchase and 90 day warranty, but as a disclaimer, I have not needed the warranty, so cannot speak to if that actually works if necessary. I would definitely buy a used iphone on amazon again because of this purchase. I actually bought another iphone 8 plus for my elderly mom, and she is pleased.",2020年3月8日 在美国审核

You Get What You Pay For - Done With Refurbished,"After 3 returns, I finally gave up on ordering a refurbished iPhone. The 1st one came with a busted mic, meaning someone on the other end could not hear me talking during a phone call. The 2nd and 3rd orders came from a different vendor and both had the same issue: busted speakers. It was a case in which the left speaker wasn’t equal with the right speaker. Like when you listen to a song with only one earbud. That was how all sound came out of the phone. Some sounds came in clear and other sounds came in muffled and in the background. I know this sounds a bit picky, but if I’m paying $500+ for a phone, having the speakers output properly is important to me. You can do speaker tests on YouTube but I do not believe this is a test that amazon runs they’re phones through, since the same problem occurred twice in a row.",2020年6月25日 在美国审核

My first IPhone,"I recently switched over from Android and I am really liking this phone much better than the Droid.All of the issues that I was having; mostly connectivity issues are completely gone. The screen interface and the ease of using apps is great. The camera is awesome; video and picture is extremely HD and almost as good as watching a regular HD TV; in fact I use my phone more than my TV. By the weight I feel of the phone is of very good quality and seems very durable - I go nowhere without it. I also noticed the good quality in my Itunes music that it's much better compared to my Ipod that I used for music (I had to have an IPod in addition to my droid but no more). My only complaint is that I wish the battery life were longer; I usually only get 2 or 3 days max on each charge, but that's a battery issue that we will have to deal with until batteries are revolutionized to last for weeks - maybe that day will come soon. One thing I almost forgot is that if you have 'plug-in' headphones, you will not like the fact that there is no port for them. You will have to by wireless; does't affect me because I haven't used plug-in earbuds for years.",2020年2月26日 在美国审核

Good Customer Service,I purchased two iPhone 8 pluses as Christmas presents.Both were delivered very fast and appeared to be in good shape.Unfortunately when I went to activate the phones on Christmas Day one of them showed up as stolen and could not be activated by AT&amp;T. The AT&amp;T rep said it was likely someone abandoned the account before paying it off and that is why it was ”locked”.I contacted Renew Pros thru Amazon about the issue and they were very quick to assist with a return and a refund.The silver lining was I was able to purchase an IPhone X from Renew Pros a week later for about the same price as the 8 and has worked great thus far.,2022年1月6日 在美国审核

Exactly as advertised,"Arrived with 2% max battery capacity over the minimum—I was initially concerned about this, but it seems to hold a charge pretty well so no complaints. The phone was in pristine condition—I couldn’t tell it was used TBH. Came with a charging cord and adapter that work well with the unit.I bought this because I could not read my newspaper subscriptions and emails on the tiny iPhone SE. I am able to read pretty well on this (much larger) screen. I have a ton of apps on my phone, and they barely put a dent in the 256gb memory. Yay! I was tired of of constantly deleting photos and removing less-used apps (only to reinstall them again later after deleting others).Out of “an abundance of caution” I purchased an Otterbox Defender case for the phone on eBay. The few times I’ve dropped it, my heart nearly stopped... but the phone is fine and works like a charm. Even with the built in screen protector, the keyboard is still responsive.",2020年3月17日 在美国审核

"Bad phone, not what was advertised","This phone was advertised as renewed in excellent condition. I expect a phone in excellent condition to be able to restart when you hold the home and power button down for 10 seconds. This phone doesn’t do that. It also glitches from time to time where the screen freezes up for up to five minutes. I’m returning it because I don’t want to find out what else will go wrong after the return window closesUpdate: I ordered the exact same phone again to replace the glitchy one. This one was even worse! It also lacks the ability to restart when you hold down the power and home buttons, it also does not recognize a Verizon SIM card aven though the fed I says ‘Verizon only’. To make matters worse, I’ve bought screen protectors that I will have to peel off and throw away before I return both bad phones.

Worth the upgrade!,"I love almost everything about the phone. This is an amazing new phone for being a renewed device. Awesome battery life and screen quality! I also like how they managed to give you a screen protector on the device, a SIM card slot opener with charging cable and block for the device. The only downside I didn’t like which I can’t really be picky about so much since it is a used phone was that there was some dings on the side of the phone in some places along the sides of the device and on some places around the camera as well but it doesn’t cause any defects to the camera at all. Also, (might I add) Amazon doesn’t ship the phone, it’s an individual seller so I don’t understand how it’s under “prime” when it took a week (in total) to get to me (you get two day shipping if you have prime but it still got to me in 3 days) and the seller marked the phone as “new” but you can CLEARLY tell it is a used phone when you look at it so BEWARE of slight false advertising by the seller/Amazon. I was a little hesitant at first to purchase because of all the mixed reviews but I’m happy I took a chance! This is the best upgrade from my last iPhone. Definitely pleased with my “new” phonelol",2021年1月9日 在美国审核
Great Buy,"I highly recommend you buy this phone and save yourself a lot of money. The phone arrived in perfect shape and looked exactly like a brand new phone. The phone I received didn't even have a scratch on it anywhere. Even if it would have, the phone went into a case so that would not of been a issue. I actually trust this more than a new one because this was went over by a tech person so you know there will be no issues and there were none.The battery life is the same as if it were brand new and everything is working perfectly.

FAULTY PRODUCT!!,"This phone has literally failed me after only a few months of having it, and I’m having consistent problems with getting it to charge. It started off that it wouldn’t charge sometimes, but now it’s constant! Not to mention, when I first got it, there was already a small chip taken out of the screen that I just overlooked. You’re better off just paying several hundred dollars more to get a new one, instead of throwing your money away on a faulty product like this, that won’t even last you 6 months before you have to replace it!

Just okay,"This is my second BuySpry seller purchase of an iPhone. The first, an Amazon Renewed jet black 256gb iPhone 7 Plus, only had 84% battery health. This Amazon Renewed 64gb iPhone 8 Plus battery is at 94% but has a fairly scratched up screen that was covered by a fresh screen protector upon receipt. FWIW, an out of warranty screen repair on this phone is $169 from Apple, so it’s actually cheaper to buy from Apple as a Certified Refurbished if you want an absolutely pristine “renewed” iPhone because those phones get brand new batteries and new screens.Still haven’t decided if I’ll keep this one. For me, the cost savings just doesn’t quite make up for the screen being this scratched.",2019年7月23日 在美国审核
Keeps shutting off.,"I like big iPhone with no niches so the only relatively new option that I have is the iPhone 8 Plus. And since Apple does not sell it anymore, I bought this iPhone directly from Amazon so it is much easier to return in case the phone was not as claimed. This was called “Amazon Renewed Premium” and the price was around twenty percent more that the price of other similar Amazon Renewed iPhones sold by third party seller, which I never buy from.A couple of days later, I got the iPhone8 Plus with the nice package and a long certificate which assured me that the iPhone was inspected by “certified technicians.”Anyway, I started using the phone and it started shutting off. I thought that was okay. Then it did again and again and again. I updated the iPhone to IOS14, but the problem kept happening. It shuts off every hour or so on its own.Bottom line, I am very disappointed and I am planning to return it. Believe me, buy new and save yourselves all this headache.",2020年9月27日 在美国审核

The only thing I noticed is that there are micro scratches on the display glass, however, they can ONLY be seen when you aim the display at the sun (who even does that?).

It’s a used phone.,"I got this after my previous iPhone had been stolen and I didn’t like the notch on the newer ones so I settled on the iPhone 8’s. When I received it I was happy to see that they had included a OEM Apple cable and brick for charging. The phone was free of any major defects and everything worked as it should except for the earpiece being slightly damaged and prone to fuzziness and distortion at even moderate volume. A single scuff was on a corner of the chassis indicating that it had been dropped at some point, though who hasn’t dropped their phone at least once right? The battery was in near perfect condition according to the iPhone battery health check which was nice. The only reason that the price was maybe justified was that I had selected the Product (Red) edition. Still, it was a high price for a used base 64GB configuration iPhone from two generations back.<br>Ps.

BuySPRY: Not As Good As Other Certified Refurbished iPhones I've Purchased on Amazon,"I want to preface this review by stating that this is the fourth Certified Refurbished iPhone I've purchased on Amazon. Ihave bought a 16 GB Rose Gold iPhone 6s Plus from Kiss Electronics Inc, a 16 GB Rose Gold iPhone 6s from ELECTRONIC DEALS, and a 32 GB Rose Gold iPhone 7 Plus from MyWit. All three of those iPhones I purchased arrived in a condition that was nearly indistinguishable from brand new, with the exception of the battery. None of them had any noticeable scratches or scuffs on the screen, or on the metal casing or back, and all components worked normally. One of them arrived with a battery that could only charge to 80% of it's original capacity, but the seller prompty reimbursed the ~ $35.00 I paid to Apple to get the battery replaced.I purchased this 64 GB Gold iPhone 8 Plus from BuySPRY to replace an old iPhone 6 I had that would no longer turn on due to water damage. The device arrived in nice packaging with a third party charger and lightning cable, and even included a SIM removal tool (a nice touch, it's way easier to use than trying to jam a paperclip into the SIM hole)The good: The metal sides and glass back of the phone are in impeccable condition, indistinguishable from that of a new iPhone right out of the box. The buttons, cameras, sensors, and microphones all appear to be in normal working order.The okay: Battery health is at 89%; obviously not as good as that of a brand new phone, but actually better than most of the other certified refurbished iPhones I have purchased on Amazon.The bad: The screen is NOT in perfect condition. There is a scratch in the lower left quadrant of the screen, ~ 3/4 of a centimeter long that is clearly visible in normal usage when viewed against a light background. The stereo speakers sound clearly distorted, especially at louder volumes. Apple advertises the 8 Plus as having louder, better stereo speakers than those on the iPhone 7 Plus, but the stereo speakers on my iPhone 7 Plus sound WAY better than those on my iPhone 8 Plus (my 7 Plus speakers can get pretty loud without sounding distorted or blown out).Conclusion: I know it may sound like I'm being too harsh in my review of this iPhone 8 Plus. I'm sure that many people would be totally fine using this phone as their everyday phone without issue, and I may continue to use this phone as my main phone for the time being because I'm strongly considering upgrading this fall. I might just tolerate this phone's flaws for until then, because it is still such a pain in the ass to migrate from one iPhone to another.But I cannot help but be disappointed because this clearly doesn't live up to the excellent standard I became accustomed to with the 3 other Certified Refurbished iPhones I purchased on Amazon.",2019年6月28日 在美国审核

The maximum capacity for the battery came at 89%but it still lasts all day. It came with a generic cord and an Apple charging block.

The phone arrived in excellent, like-new condition. The phone's battery life has so far exceeded that of my old iphone 6s, and the performance was snappy. It felt like I had just taken this phone out of the original packaging... except for the defective touch screen. The screen on the phone I received would often fail to register my touches.

Crack on home button etc.,"Just received my iPhone 8 plus in the mail today and at first glance it looked to be in good condition, but when I removed it from the bubble wrap I immediately noticed the home button had been cracked. I looked around the rest of the phone and there are some minor scratches and wear and tear but what caught my attention was the weird off-colored molding that holds the phone in place? I'm not sure how to explain it but it looks like a tacky-glue job was placed to cover up other damage in the lining of the phone. I hope this doesn't cause any mechanical issues with the phone because that's definitely not what I paid for. So far no issues turning it on and using it so we'll keep an eye out.",2020年4月28日 在美国审核
Screen cracked when we got it and is still cracking,"3/6/22: phone doesn't hold a charge for very long and like I started before the charging box has never worked. When I got correspondence from seller about screen protector they told me it was explained there was one, I've searched and find no info like that.2nd update 2/14/22: There was a screen protector that came on the phone, that is what was cracking and after we took it off the actual screen was fine. The phone is functioning well and actually better now that the screen protector from the seller has been removed.Update: 2/11/22 Finally getting to the email from the company that is telling me after I had to send pictures that if I send the phone back they will give me a refund..... So my daughter will be out of a phone for how long..?! I'm so mad! The screen is cracking more each day and is almost unusable as well as the fact the glass is now sharp. I would avoid this company at all costs! Obviously they sell a crappy product that will fall apart and cost you more time and energy than just going and buying a newer one. :(My daughter saved up and treats this phone like a baby, yet the small crack it came with is not not the only one now. There are cracks showing up more and more. It's had a screen protector and case on it grub the minute we opened it. It has not been dropped. Faulty screen is all I can think of.

My screws were stripped, the phone did not have the apple water seal, meaning the phone had water damage before it got to me.

"Overall good deal, some issues with phone","The biggest issue I have is that the screen must have been replaced in a way that True Tone is no longer even an option on the phone. I do believe that the screen is oem, as the colors are pretty good, but since true tone is not an option it could just be a good knockoff screen, either way the screen looks good so not having true tone isn't enough to go through a return. The battery health is at 87%, which is fine, but after it dips around 80% I'm gonna have to pay $50 for a replacement battery. It is only guaranteed to be at 80, which seems kind of low since Apple recommends the battery be changed at 80, but this is not the fault of the seller, 87 is fine and more than guaranteed. Overall the phone is a good deal and it came in good condition, but the fact that the screen was replaced in a way where it doesn't offer true tone anymore is enough to knock off two starts for me.",2020年2月8日 在美国审核

If ur holding the phone wit the screen facing u the left speakers don’t work not sure y.OVERALL&gt;Other than those things it’s pretty good.

not a good buy.  Phone was missing parts. Phone broke easily,Updated 2 months after using phone.....This phone seemed really good at first.Then the screen broke the first time i dropped it on the carpet. I took it in to get fixed and they said my phone was missing a metal plate on the front that holds the screen in place.So i have to get one to make sure the screen keeps breaking.It also had the home button quit working and start working again. And one time it died and took an entire day to turn back on while plugged in.I wouldnt buy it again knowing what i now know,2020年3月27日 在美国审核

I can’t totally complain as it was above the stated 80% or better. The one I got is at 85%, which is fine and useable. I was just hoping for maybe 90% or better. Anyway, great phone and great price!I upgraded from an iPhone 6s Plus that I had for 5-6 years, so this is a nice upgrade from that. I didn’t want to shell out over $1000 for an iPhone 12, plus I’m not a fan of Face ID since I have to wear a mask at work. This iPhone 8 Plus has Touch ID which always works great and super fast.

Doesn’t recognize my fingerprint! So back to apple we go. I will never buy another phone made by apple. What a big bunch of wasted time. Took off 2 step verification. It works finally.

Terrible speakers,"This was the second of two iphone 8s we purchased in the same month from different sellers. The first came securely packaged, with a nice charger very similar to the original. The speakers can be listened to without external amplification, and sound beautiful.

Buy if you want phone that don't work porperly,"I ordered two GOLD iPhone 8 PLUS 64gb fully unlocked (renewed) for my two younger sisters. It arrived on July 6th, 2020. I transferred their own phone over to the new phone. When it arrived, it's on a 3rd party box with 3rd party charger and 3rd party cable. There was no headphones, which my sisters don't really care for. The conditions is a solid 9/10 (since it's renewed). They have been using it for only 24 hours now and so far, when I ask them, is the phone good? Anything wrong with it? They told me, no. Since I haven't give them a phone number yet, I can't test if it will accept T-Mobile SIM card. I hope it does.EDIT: (UPDATE) 05/28/2021So, apparently one of the phone I've purchased on July 2020, doesn't work. I had returned one phone and bought it again with another venders/seller. That phone that I purchased with the other seller is working properly. The phone that I still have that I purchased from this seller is not working properly. I've added the phone to my phone plan and installed a SIM Card on it. Usually it would read the SIM Card and worked properly. But I installed it, wait for it to read, it didn't. I turned it off, turned it back on and was hoping that would work. It didn't I tried it more than a couple of times as well. Still nothing. I went to T-Mobile (my carrier), and they told me that the phone was ""report stolen and locked by Sprint."" I was shocked to find that out. Sprint had blocked/locked the SIM Card reader or whatever and that was why it wasn't reading the SIM Card whatsoever. I emailed the seller and they told me that because it has been more than 3 months, the warranty is out. I told them that with the Amazon Renewed Product, it stated that for Renewed Premium, I should still have 1 year warrranty. The person that was emailing me back, told me to send it back for a replacement. I told them I wanted a refund because I'm not about to purchased/replace it with the phones from them knowing that the phones that they sell is not working properly. They told me that they cannot do that. I'm really frustrated that they don't make a exception in this case because it was not my fault but the phone. I'm sure NOBODY would take a replacement cause I'm sure as hell am not taking the chance. So they just told me to call Amazon directly for help. This is really a simple and easily solvable matter that would leave both party happy. Yet, they make this so hard. Yes, the customer support response fast, but other than that, each customer support that email you back, don't even do their job properly. They don't even read the email going back and forth. Each email contradict the other. I sure as hell won't be purchasing from this seller no more. And I hope this review would help people trying to buy iPhones avoid this seller. That's all I got.",2020年7月8日 在美国审核

SELLER IS A SCAM ARTIST!!!!,I bought this phone and after a week or so it had days it won’t hold a charge even when barely used. I had my son who has always had iPhones look at it see if I had something running in the background or if it was a settings thing. Nothing unusual. Just some days the battery would drain so I figured it was defective. I requested to return it to the seller as defective and they agreed. WELL… it took 3 weeks and a complaint about them to Amazon before they processed my return AND they charged me a $135 restocking fee for the return!! Unbelievable. Not only are they ripping me off but plan on doing it to someone else. Makes me wonder how many times they’ve resold the same defective phone! Btw I bought the same phone from another seller on Amazon and have been perfectly happy with it.,2021年5月28日 在美国审核

Don't gamble your money and waste your time.,"I purchased this phone knowing it was used in ""renewed"" ""excellent"" condition. I absolutely expected light scratches and imperfections.

It is deep enough to be seen at all times with the screen on or off.I foolishly assumed that it was a hair under the screen protector. No big deal, right? Ordered a new screen protector and while I waited on it to arrive, I went ahead and set the phone up and activated it. Once I got the new screen protector, I peeled the old one off only to discover the damaged screen. This is definitely noticeable at ""arm's length"".

No way to know,The i-phone 8 was in great physical condition as advertised. The phone had microphone issues and would not transmit voice in phone conversations. The microphone would work to record answer message and notes but not on phone conversation. We were told it was a common i-phone 8plus defective software issue. The phone was insured and was replaced by my carrier (SIM card) company. Yes it was an ordeal!,2020年9月13日 在美国审核

Shipping takes longer than expected,Honestly so far so good . The phone was unlocked fully from what I can tell so far . The battery is at 90% capacity which is decent . I’ve come to notice though that the left speaker on the phone doesn’t work and it makes the right speaker sound distorted at times . The shipping also took way too long . I am an amazon prime member and I used my 2 day free shipping that comes with the membership but the phone took 5 days to get to me . That’s just a little unreasonable . Other than that the phones in okay condition no major scratches or anything like that . Lived up to my expectation besides the speakers .,2020年2月27日 在美国审核

Poorly refurbished phone.,"I bought this iPhone 8 Plus almost three months ago and everything seemed to work great at first. It wasn’t until after the first month, problems began to develop. The front speaker stopped working, then the touch screen would randomly open app’s without even touching the screen. I tried to reach out to the seller and they refused to replace the phone even though it is in there policy. Another month later, the phone would get very hot during charging and the phone would become very slow. I assume it must be a battery issue, and also the battery life is terrible. It would not recommend this seller to anyone, who are looking for a good refurbished phone. Unless the seller responds to me and honors their policy, I will be returning it.

"Good overall, but…","I’ve had this phone for about a month now. The screen works fine. Has a couple of scratches but none that bother me. The battery health and camera quality are really good. One issue is that only one speaker works. I assume this is why I can’t set up “hey siri”. I don’t understand this because I don’t have issues with people hearing me during calls and the one speaker is loud enough to satisfy me when I’m watching videos, etc.",2020年6月13日 在美国审核

Didn't work after the 3 month window - Won't refund or replace after they tried to tell me I could!,"I ordered this phone and received it in good condition. We immediately put a case on it and protected it. We had no issues, but after exactly the time of the refund window was over, the WiFi antenna stopped working. There was no mishandling, drops, etc. After doing some extensive research we found that the antenna is within the phone. It's not something we could have accessed to even fix, but why should we when we only had it for JUST over 3 months and handled with care.I contacted the seller and they tried to tell me to return or replace the item. They were willing to call and walk me through the return and were going to replace it with another product.After they realized that the return window was over - again, ironically AFTER the phone WiFi quit working, they stopped trying to fix the problem and quit talking. I can't even press the WiFi to turn it on. I can't turn it on in the settings either.So, don't buy from them because they won't guarantee a good product. I am not one to write reviews, but this is worth writing because the phone isn't even 4 months in my hands and the WiFi can't be turned on, nor will they return, replace, or credit with anything.

A large flaw,Phone was overall good. Looks magnificent and sleek. One MAJOR issues that was apparent. The top speaker that you put up to your ear doesn’t work AT ALL. Like there is literally no sound that come out of that port and I can’t call anyone. Then another thing is the glue they used to keep the screen to the phone. I’ve heated it up over and over and still can’t get the screen off to fix my issue.

Don’t buy anything from model electronics,"I unfortunately bought this from “Model Electronics.” The product sent to me is and continues to be subpar, as is their customer service. There is no way that the phone they sent me lives up to the Amazon renewed standard of “ High-Quality ProductProfessionally inspected, tested, and cleaned to work and look like new.” The phone I received was missing pretty much all of its internal screws, all connector plates, and the back plate for the screen. This information was only found out after I droppedthe phone while in a very protective case and it stopped working. And of course, it cost me money to find out this information. Now it has unfortunately been more than a year since I bought this subpar phone, and it is having more issues, unsurprisingly because of the missing components. The touchscreen no longer recognizes touch on the left and right sides as well as at the top. I have gotten in contact with the company that sold me this phone, and they refuse to do anything about the problems I am having because they sold me a subpar piece of equipment which is missing its inner components.

The mobile is unusable and my money went in vain... For those who are not based in the US before buying such a phone on Amazon you have to make sure that it will be compatible with your GSM network.

Glad I picked the 8 Plus over the X!,"I went from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 8 Plus. I considered the X, but just didn't care for that annoying notch, narrower aspect ratio and lack of touch ID, so the 8 Plus was preferable to the X. The bigger screen is a must (especially for people like myself who are always working and rely on a phone when we're away from the office.) You won't regret it!The 8 Plus is extremely heavy compared to the aluminum iPhones; it took me awhile to adjust. After comparing it to the iPhone X, I feel the 8 Plus's heft gives it a premium feel. I just wish they would have at least narrowed the bezels even a smidge. It's past due time for a refresh.The 8 plus has an incredible battery life! The true tone feature is definitely worth the hype and the camera is amazing! I use it all the time and people sometimes ask me ""what kind of DLSR do you have?"" They can't believe I took the photo on my iPhone!",2018年8月14日 在美国审核

"""Renewed"" = ""Used"". It Can Be Souped Up and Parts Replaced ...  But It's Still Used.","I've read a number of the reviews on these ""RENEWED"" phones and<br> the primary point that tends to be missed is NOT just what the phone is delivered as when receiving the package, BUT what the USED phone is like a year later. On any USED item, this should be what is most important. When I first received my USED phone from BuySPRY, I thought it was ""incredible"". It literally looked and acted close to ""brand new"" and I saw no issues over the next month. THAT is a company that cares about its customer. Right? However, the one thing that adding a little spit polish and tightening a few things here and there does NOT offer is winding the clock backwards. With that said, SURE it's a nice USED. However, it IS USED. I probably saved around$100 on mine. My other Apple did well for about three years before it started slowing down a bit. I figured this one might be two ... maybe a year and a half? I mean, you get what you pay for here, right? NOPE. One YEAR LATER, the phone was already acting like my last Apple after THREE YEARS. In fact, it was acting WORSE. The battery charge was even a lot shorter. So, keep in mind that HERE you commonly DO NOT get what you pay for with these products. You can view this as saving a little $ up front. However, this phone should have been another $100 off. THAT is all it was worth. BUYER BEWARE!</br>",2020年11月16日 在美国审核

"Bought 2 (separate occasions), neither as advertised","3 weeks ago I bought an iPhone 8 Plus from this company. It was advertised fully unlocked as well as network unlocked. Well knowing that I would need to link my network to it, I had the reasonable expectation it would be fully unlocked. It was not. The device still had some sort of network attached from the previous owner and I am not able to unlock it myself nor take it to a store to break it. I returned it and ordered one that was specific to my network (Sprint). I got the phone, it did not come with a SIM card as advertised (not too big of a deal) but the phone was still activated on someone else's sprint account. I can't suggest for anyone to not buy from this business, but given the bad circumstances, I am certain you will have a negative experience.",2020年4月22日 在美国审核

iPhone 8S major dissappointment,"I've been an iPhone user since the beginning.Its always seemed like a solid easy to use product, with the exception of the screen in sunlight and outdoor pictures, which I'm convinced is the worst among other smart phones.I recently updated from 6S to 8S, and the screen and pictures are still very bad outdoors, but the biggest complaint is they got rid of the headset port.There's only the charging port, which I'm at loss to why they think 1 port is convenient in any way, especially when traveling, which is the whole idea of MOBILE!!",2019年4月3日 在美国审核
"Very disappointed, my item arrived defective. I would choose some other seller.","I got my product, it looked great at the beginning, screen was great, no scratches,just a minor one on the back, seemed pretty good, great battery life, probably a full charge lasts all day from 9am to 8pm of regular phone use. Everything else seemed awesome, till I tried to make my first call. The person I was calling was not able to hear me. I tried to record voice memos; it would not record my voice, just a static sound, and the same sound with no voice that the person that received my call described. Researching a bit and doing some basic tests I found out that the lower microphones were damaged. Top microphones (front and rear) do record normal audio.I'm disappointed with Amazon as before purchasing my device I asked costumer service about the seller, the product and if they could guarantee that I would get a good functional product; they said that I was going to be very satisfied with it. I explained that I was going to be traveling out of the country and I needed to make sure I was going to get a fully functional product with no flaws as I was not going to be able to go through any return process. They reassured me that I was going to be very satisfied with the product.Guess what it was not. After I complained about it, they told me that the only solution was to return the product and get my money back. But for me it is impossible right now as I’m abroad. I tried to write to Fiesta Renew, the seller to see if they could give me a solution, I didn't expect to receive a defective device and now I'm unable to return it. They never answered back. The worst thing is that it is a very obvious damage; it’s hard to believe that it “successfully passed a full diagnostic of tests and inspections fulfilled by Amazon-qualified suppliers”.Long story short I’m stuck with a defective device, unable to return it and no other solutions were given to my nor by Amazon or Fiesta Renew.I would choose a different seller.",2020年1月19日 在美国审核
