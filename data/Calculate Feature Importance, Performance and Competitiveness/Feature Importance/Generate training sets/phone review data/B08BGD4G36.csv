Don’t listen to all the negative reviews!,"I’ll admit after reading through the reviews I was VERY hesitant but I am BEYOND happy with my purchase.<br>The phone is FLAWLESS. Yes you read that right, absolutely flawless. It came with a glass screen protector already installed and all OEM accessories. Phone has a BRAND NEW 100% capacity battery and is still under factory warranty until May 2020. I understand some of this will vary but this is a review of my experience.I purchased another “renewed” phone, Pixel 2XL, from a different seller and it’s perfectly functional but no where near the condition this iPhone XR arrived in.I just popped my SIM card in and it worked right away. Usually with my carrier I have to call in with the imei number but I didn’t have to. I also tried a GSM SIM card and it worked too, fully unlocked as advertised.Best. Used. Phone. Purchase.

Mind Blown,"Update: 04/06/2021: I still have this phone. Still works amazing. Battery lasts me all day even at 50%. Works like new. 100% worth every penny :).Update: 10/27/2020: My phone still works the same way it did when I got it even though I’ve dropped it and mishandled it a few times :)Update 03/14/2020: This phone still works perfectly. I don’t carry my charger with me during the day anymore. 64GB is a perfect amount of storage. This phone has frozen up less than 5 times since I got it. Screen still looks great (I cracked it but it’s working) and everything is still fast and accurate. I’ve had no issues. This is the best phone I’ve had in a while. Also the camera is amazing and I’ve come to fall in love with it. (I’ve attached a picture I took with the phone below)My phone is amazing! Obviously I’d show it if I wasn’t on it right now. I waited a few days before making this review so I could make sure no quirks popped up.First of all this is the best battery life I’ve ever had on a phone EVER. I went out for 8 hours and came home and my phone was on 74% at the end of the day. Same thing with school. My phone was at about 50% at the end of the school day. Now it charges pretty slowly in my opinion but the slow charging is definitely worth the battery.Size wise the phone is pretty big. It is a handful to hold and hard to throw in my pocket. The screen size is beautiful for watching videos and doing digital stuff but the phone is just a little big.The software works perfectly. The touch is fine, Face ID is incredibly fast and accurate, and it opens apps very fast. It also responds really well to my touch. My last phone did not.The speaker is amazing. It’s so loud that I didn’t even need my speaker in the shower. The phone was loud enough by itself. I took a call in a room full of noisy kids and my dad said he couldn’t even really hear them. So they cancel noise. Microphone is good. I can say “hey Siri” quietly and it’ll activate.Overall I’m really impressed. I was very nervous looking at other reviews but my phone is working so perfectly right now. I am definitely satisfied especially with paying $200 less than apple was charging.Then again I upgraded from a cracked 6s so that could be the reason I’m so over the moon haha",2019年8月14日 在美国审核

Came with the charger and it was just like any brand new purchased phone.I had a previous SIM card, called Metro by TMobile and Transferred alTransferredl the info to the new IPhone and Vuala, i Gad a fully working iPhone for less than 500$ (My goal) and didn’t even needed to go to the store to activate.So, overall on my personal opinion with no benefits or paying me for review, this was a GREAT purchase!",2020年3月5日 在美国审核

Great Amazon Renewed Item,"This was a gift for my sister's birthday. Worked like a charm. The only set back was having to catch up the phone on all of the updates but that was resolved and the set up was overall easy to do and manageable. I would definitely buy an Amazon Renewed product in the future. If Amazon is putting their stamp of approval on these types of items, I as the consumer am trusting this company to make sure what I am getting is up to par with the standards I hold this company that I've been using for years. iPhones are not the cheapest phones by a landslide so I expect these bricks to work well even if they are partially used. Great condition overall without any scratches almost new if anything else and arrived in packaging protecting the device.",2019年9月23日 在美国审核
Works perfectly,"For starters: it depends on what seller you go through when ordering these phones. I bought mine through Digital Age USA and the phone is perfect! It said it was supposed to arrive February 2nd but it arrived January 19th. I’m sure it’s because I live only a few hours away from where it was shipping from. It did come with a charger box that wasn’t Apple but if you actually read the description it says that could happen and that it won’t come with headphones. Completely understandable considering these are used phones. Other than a TINY scratch on the outside of the back camera, the phone is flawless with no severe scratches. I’ve had the phone for 2 days now and I haven’t run into any issues. The touch screen works perfectly and I was able to turn it on through Total Wireless (which goes through Verizon).<br>My advice for anyone wanting to get a renewed phone: LOOK AT THE SELLER! The seller I bought this from has a 90% rating. The very next day a different seller was on here with only a 70% rating. If the seller doesn’t have a good rating DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!! Wait until another seller comes up with decent reviews.</br>",2021年1月21日 在美国审核

Almost Perfect,"I was a bit nervous getting renewed but I'm on a budget and I had to buy this plus the Apple Watch 6 for health tracking purposes. There is absolutely no scuffs, dings, or scratches. The only way you can tell it is renewed was battery life was about 89% Which isn't horrible. It still lasts me the day and as this isn't brand new, I'm not dinging a star for that. (Plus I believe that is better than advertised)<br>This along with the watch were my first ever Apple products. I previously had a Moto Stylus and a Samsung Galaxy Active 2 Watch. I wanted a watch that would alert me when I had an Afib episode, which the samsung didn't. A lot of afib patients suggest Apple watch for this, which meant I needed an Apple phone.The battery, even new, I don't think would have outperformed my Moto but that's a thing Moto is kinda known for is their big batteries. But as mentioned before, it lasts me all day.I LOVE the blue color. I bought a rugged clear case from local store so that I could protect it while still being able to see the pretty color.Had zero problems putting Mint Mobile on it, so unlocked as promised. Never used an esim before so that was really neat.The apps are amazing and far more varied than Android. That night time wind down is no joke, but I like it. It really is great at making sure I don't pick up my phone and just mess around after bed time and I like that it gives me a little warning so I can go read or do something to wind down for bed.Display is clear and nice.Performance is snappy. A little sad there's not a headphone jack but that's pretty typical these days. Just nice to have something for when your earbuds run out of juice. But it synced upOverall, I know this phone is a bit older in 2022 but I honestly feel like it's almost better than some of the flagship Android phones that are new at a lower price. Overall, I'm really happy. It's really helped become a health tracker as much as a phone. I'm getting why people like Apple now and will probably buy more apple products in the future.</br>",2022年5月24日 在美国审核
Pristine Refurbished Phone Exceeds ALL Expectations!,"This phone is AWESOME and in 9.9999/10 condition! Buying an Amazon Renewed product comes with a little bit of a lowered expectation for appearance and battery life. However, and that's a big however, this phone was pristine! My order was fulfilled by TRADEMORE. The screen is in perfect shape and is responsive as it should be. Faced works great. The cameras have no wear and work perfectly. The body has one tiny visible scratch that is completely covered by the case. Battery life is 100%! I spent weeks looking for a refurb phone in excellent condition that wasn't overpriced and I'm so glad I went for this one. It also came with Apple branded cable and block which was a huge surprise. Note that every phone is going to be different when you're buying Renewed, but this was a total win. Before this I had ordered a Renewed iPhone XS (it came from a different fulfiller - Kiss Electronics Inc) and it came with a chipped camera, visible scratches, and the sticky cover on the phone was covered in hairs and fibers. It was a huge disappointment and I had to pay return shipping on it. I'm so glad I went for the XR and it far exceeded all of my expectations. I highly recommend!",2020年4月24日 在美国审核
ITS WORTH THE MONEY ! &amp; don’t listen to the negative reviews !,"Everything about this phone is just amazing ! I was soooo scared to order at first but I literally scrolled thru all the reviews and was just like why not ? And I’m glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews I’m so glad I didn’t ! Just got my package today I was sooo nervous to open it but when I did I was amazed at how it came in there’s not one scratch or dent or any other damage you would describe on this phone ! Screen is pretty sensitive if you ask me and the camera is beautiful ! Oh and it also works with cricket guys so I’d definitely get it unlocked if you’re a cricket customer like me :) also I just wanna say I brought this from seller MyWit , very good service ! And I would show vids or pictures of the phone but I’m obviously on it now lol just kno this phone is in great condition almost as if its really brand new . Battery life is good too . charges up pretty fast if you ask me and the phone does last awhile I doubt you’d even need a charger to go anywhere with it and also I see how some reviews complain about how it doesn’t come with headphones .. but obviously if you read about the phone and what the seller says about it you’d see that it stated no headphones comes with the package but best believe a charger does !

A pretty nice phone for the price!,"Boo yah! My phone came in mint condition with an Apple charger.<br>Something people need to know about newer iPhones is the materials have changed. Opposed to older models that were more scratch resistant but more prone to shattering when dropped, the newer models traded in the scratch resistance factor for higher durability and less likelihood of shattering occurring. There’s a coating on it and yes, you will ABSOLUTELY need not only a proper case for this phone, but also a screen protector. I did not know this until after purchasing this phone and noticed some minor cosmetic scratches from my light usage.My unsolicited advice if buying is to also purchase a case and screen protector simultaneously so you don’t have to deal with scratching. Both can be found on Amazon together for under $20 total.Unless you’re totally rich and don’t care. Then do whatever you want because this is probably your back up back up iPhone.</br>",2019年7月25日 在美国审核

If at first you don't succeed,"When I received a reconditioned iPhone XR I purchased last week, upon turning it on, I saw a small number of apps on the screen, which should not have been the case. I then found it still had the previous owner's iCloud ID assigned to it. I don't know if it was a return and the person had neglected to sign out their ID, or what, and it somehow got placed back in stock without proper examination. In any case, because it still had that other person's iCloud ID assigned to it, I was locked out of doing anything with it, so, exasperated, I returned it with an explanation of the problem.With much hesitation (because of many complaints by other reviewers as well as my own experience), I subsequently placed an order for another reconditioned iPhone XR. When I received it and turned it on, with much relief I saw the multi-language ""HELLO"" screen, meaning, at least, I should be able to proceed with entering in my own iCloud ID. The iPhone didn't have a scratch on it and it looked brand new (for that matter, the first XR I received also looked brand new). In fact, when I checked the battery efficiency state in the one I just received, it indicated 100%, indicating its newness.I have a flip phone that has a very inexpensive yearly rate that I use for the rare times I need a cell phone, so I didn't want to buy a smart phone just for cellular calling. I bought this iPhone XR, not to use as a phone, but to use as an intermediate tablet between my iPad Mini and my iPod touch. The iPad Mini is too big to fit even in my cargo pants pockets, and my iPod Touch screen is too small to do anything serious with it when I'm away from home. This iPhone XR is great for that purpose because it fits in my pocket and it is a usable size.I also like some of the other features, such as the touch features, and even the lack of the home button. I am quite happy with it. I have a WiFi hotspot to use with it, so I can do just about everything I could with a cell-connected smart phone.I thought of giving a three star overall rating because of the experience I had with the previous iPhone XR, but I like this one so much I am giving it five stars.",2021年11月10日 在美国审核

No phone crashes and the speakers on the device have been working well. The battery has held up well during this time (try to not let the battery life drop below 40% too many, can affect the battery health).

I feel so fortunate that Amazon gave me a big discount on this new phone (since I got an Amazon credit card, to save something like $125) AND the phone came with unexpected gifts: screen protector &amp; elegant case!(The case is not as strong as what I'm used to, but I love not having the headache of having to buy two more items.) THANK YOU, Amazon!I am afraid the battery life &amp; camera aren't as awesome as the new iphone 13's, but they're still way better than the iphone7 I left behind (which was working okay after 5 years of ownership, so it's sad I killed a new 13 so quickly, in my haste to give a friend a ride home one night, unexpectedly).",2022年3月31日 在美国审核

READ MY REVIEW (you’ll need it sis).,"i know a lot of people are a little sketchy when it comes to these types of things. but it all depends on the seller. look for high ratings. my face id works great, the phone came on time and shipped fast, i was able to transfer everything over from my 7 plus to this phone. It is unlocked. i had no problems with my carrier. phone came with scratches but they weren’t noticeable at all until i really looked. the glass both back and front are perfect. no dents at all. just waiting on a case. the battery life came at 92% which is great until i have to get a new battery next year. CPRTX was my seller, their communication was fast and i would HIGHLY recommend getting their phones.

Very satisfied,"I bought the black iPhone from Chubbiestech. It came clean with a charger, cable, and hard screen protector I can apply myself. It looks almost new.<br>There's a small shallow scratch across the top of the screen which I notices during my initial inspection but I haven't noticed it since then. I've been using this for over 2 weeks now.The battery says it's at 94% health but it fully charged and lasts forever. I have had 0 issues. I'm very pleased with what I received and would order from them again.</br>",2020年2月29日 在美国审核
Christmas gift (from my Mom) for my Dad,"The Amazon Premium Renewed gets 5 stars all on its own. If you can find a device with that, pay the extra (from 'just' Amazon Renewed) and get it! Also, absolutely cannot tell the phone was ever pre-owned or pre-used!!The iPhone XR was an upgrade gift for my Dad from my Mom. His old device was an iPhone 6. He takes ALOT of photos. Every truck show, every tractor show, every time the grands are around, and all the weird bugs... he has pics - lol. And his iPhone 6 (8GB! Lol) ran into a conundrum: It was full of photos, so it didn't have space for his updates. And because it couldn't update, he couldn't upload his photos to the cloud. Also, he wanted a bigger screen. (I'm the same, why put on glasses when you can just have a bigger screen ♀).I honestly thought that the 'swipe the screen away' feature - replacing the home button - would drive him up the wall. He hasn't said a word! (BEEEEELIEVE me... he's at that wonderful, fully liberated age where he says whatever he thinks and doesnotcare). He truly loves this phone! Score 1 for technology when an OG Baby Boomer embraces the ease of use, transitioning up (what?) 4 years in advancements and upgrades AND LIKES IT!!",2021年2月12日 在美国审核

8 months later...,"I bought this phone in December 2020 because my iPhone 7 plus was not compatible with Verizon, which I was switching to from Cricket. I have to say, I was somewhat leery due to multiple reviews that were not happy with this phone, and during the holiday season, over $400 was quite a lot to shell out on a 'maybe' this is a good phone. But, I bought my 7 plus refurbished in April 2020, and it was still working great (still is, as I use it for gaming and reading ebooks), so I decided to go out on a limb. I'm quite happy that I did. The phone only had one noticeable scratch on it, which was easily covered by a phone case, and it works flawlessly. The battery life was at 88% then and now (I was slightly disappointed to be dropping from 96%), and it will last me all day long. I work 11+ hours in a poor signal area, and by the time I get home, I still have over 45% battery life remaining. By far better than any Samsung products I've used in the past.",2021年7月10日 在美国审核
It’s pretty good,"So everything seems to work as intended, it’s unlocked and works on my carrier. Battery Health is at 91% and lasts me almost a whole day. Face ID works and is quite snappy. Came with the 128gb that I ordered. Both the glass front and back came with very minimal and hard to see scratches to none, However the the frame is a little damaged as described near the screws on the bottom and some small marks/ dents near the back glass also some etching on the frame (some kindve wiped off, some will not) from a plastic case? But it’s in a case most of the time so it doesn’t really bother me too much! Camera works well and takes good photos. Screen gets pretty bright and is crisp, but as it being a replaced screen it doesn’t have True Tone functionality. The buttons literally not there. All the physical buttons work and don’t get stuck. Just know if you’re coming from a pretty slim phone like a 6s plus or similar ones, you’ll be shocked with how thick the XR truly is. It comes with 3 gigs of ram, which in todays standard sounds very small but the phone manages its ram decently well. Of course if you have a lot open and you’re switching apps it’ll rarely restart an application. If you’re a mobile gamer it runs mobile legends great, PUBG is pretty good. Ever so slight lag when joining a match and that’s pretty much it, I haven’t tried cod mobile but it runs Minecraft smooth if you’re into Minecraft.",2022年2月16日 在美国审核

"Long, long battery life!","I love that the Home button is gone, I was always wearing it out. Love how long the battery lasts. I don't do games, as a rule, but I do text and FB a lot, so it is nice to know I can have a connection when I'm spending a lot of time AT the VA ER waiting for my husband to be seen. I do use Kindle on there also.

"Great condition, works as advertised, easy upgrade from iPhone 6.","When key apps stopped being supported on iOS 12.5.5, I was finally forced to stop carrying a conveniently sized phone, and join the “phoneblet” mob. Tech companies care nothing for me, and the feeling is mutual.Smartphones aren’t optional, so this was the least offensive option.

Just what we needed,"My wife needed a new phone, but she loves her old phone so much that she didn’t care about the crack screen and other issues. Finally I made the switch to mint mobile and guess what her phone was not compatible. Last year I made the switch to iPhone and I’m loving it, I bought mine refurbished as well so I decided to go ahead and get her one. The phone is in perfect condition every thing was so easy to set up. And now she has wireless CarPlay in her BMW! This phone still has years of support and it updated to 15.5 so I’m sure we will get our money’s worth.

Great condition and price point!,"I bought this for my 14 years old daughter.Here is her review:I've had this IPhone for over a month now, and I have determined that buying a refurbished IPhone was a great choice to cut costs, and it's great for the environment as well! We bought from the seller 'MOBILESUPPLY'.Accessories: The IPhone came with a lightning cable and a power adapter that were not manufactured by Apple, but they were still compatible with the phone and worked just fine!Appearance: I could not see any scuff marks or any other imperfections on the IPhone (though I am not an expert).Battery: The IPhone came with 91% battery capacity (which means that the battery could hold 91% of the charge that it could hold when it was new). It can still last for 1.5-2 days without having to charge if I use apps that don't drain battery fast (such as games and Youtube).Setup: Everything was easy to set up, I just needed to log into my ICloud account and set up Siri, face ID, etc, which were all very simple. There was none of the previous owner's data on the phone.Use: I can download apps without any issues, and everything runs smoothly (no lag, glitches, etc). Face ID works very well, and the audio played from the phone's speakers sounds great!I hope this helps!",2021年8月31日 在美国审核
Overall a Great Phone!,"I have been using Apple products for as long as apples been a thing. I saw this product on multiple commercials and after doing my own research on it I decided to buy it. Some of the best features of this product are its long battery life, user-friendly interface, and low price. The iPhone Xr has the longest battery life out of all the iPhones in its generation and it lasts me the whole day without any problems. Its user interface is also very easy to navigate which makes things very convenient. The best part about this phone is its price starting at $600, compared to other iPhones that cost $1000 and above. There are some negatives to this phone, however. The camera, screen resolution and it is not durable without a case. The camera on this phone is subpar compared to other iPhones in this generation which is to be expected at its given price point. The screen is also subpar to the other iPhones as it can only go up to 1080p resolution compared to 4k. The glass on the back of the phone leaves much to be desired as it can easily shatter without protection from a case. Overall, this phone does have its drawbacks, but it is still a great buy.",2020年5月19日 在美国审核

"A+ refurb phone can pass for ""new""","The Xr was one of the best iPhones under $350. Mine arrived in two days, physically in MINT condition with zero signs of use. Battery and screen are original, and battery shows 92 percent capacity, zero issues activating on iCloud and accepted my Mint SIM with no trouble (was listed as unlocked). 128GB of storage is more than enough for most users.I am very happy with this phone as it replaces an 8 with a failing battery. The Xr will still be supported for at least 2 more years with iOS updates, and I had no problem updating mine to 15.4.1. It runs fast, and does everything I need a phone to do without being encumbered to some extortion/rip off installment plan which is nothing more than a glorified contract of adhesion that the telecom cartels LOVE.Buy your phones like I did and save, not be tied down to a service plan, and enjoy a great phone that was obviously well tested and refurbished to like new for a couple hundred instead of a thousand (or more).",2022年4月9日 在美国审核
A chick magnet,"This was the smartest decision I have made since divorcing that woman last year - buying the used iPhone. At a fraction of the cost, I got excellent screen resolution quality, superb picture quality, excellent battery life, and the status upgrade (I had had a flip phone, riser Motorola IV prior to it) I needed to get back to the dating scene in a ripe old age of slightly over 70 (which is the new 40).

I must say that I searched high and low for an affordable iPhone for my son birthday as he wanted to switch over from android and join the apple world like his Dad and I. That is when I landed on this baby right here. I have never been one very fond of renew devices because of how the appearance might look of issues with the device itself, but upon receiving this device from Amazon it blew my expectations out of the water. I was completely amazed by how like-new this device looked it came with a screen protector and case and a 90 day warranty guarantee what else more can a mother asked for.

Pleasantly surprised,"I will admit to being more the a little nervous ordering a used phone with some of the reviews I read. Those that were negative must have been an unfortunate minority or just rude spiteful people. The iPhone XR I received looks like it was new from an Apple store. No scuffs, scratches, marks, or even a fingerprint on it taking it from the shipping box. So now we get to my one and only complaint. The battery was completely depleted and there is nothing more heartbreaking then having to wait a couple minutes for a battery to charge enough to turn on.

Good buy,"Got this phone about two months now and it works great. It was my first time buying a refurbished phone and I was really skeptical but I was proven wrong. The only thing is that the battery dies after it reaches about 15% but then it charges up to 100% and it lasts for about 8 hours with regular usage. I had to buy a fast charger separate as it came with a regular 5 watt charger in the box. This was my first time buying anything from Amazon Premium. I am happy to have the year warranty on the product. Everything works well, Face ID, camera both front and back and the speakers are excellent. The phone came with one tiny scratch on the side but it’s unnoticeable and plus I always have a case on. It is also my first time with an iPhone and it took some time getting adjusted too. I honestly find Android was a bit more user friendly, but I am happy that I tried it.",2022年5月3日 在美国审核
Very Pleased,"This is our second XR renewed phone, and I have to say we are pleased with both of them. We purchased the same phone from two different sellers. The first one our son purchased so I do not know the seller. If I had known it, I would’ve used that seller. I know this doesn’t help you. I will try to find that other seller’s name if I can. The only differences were the first phone came with an actual iPhone brand charger, this one did not. It also came with the basic iPhone get started pamphlet. This one did not. It also came with a clear, solid case. This one did not. Those are questions you may want to ask. Since the first phone had those items, I just assumed it was typical, but it’s not. As far as performance, I think they’re equal. The battery MAY be a bit less than a new one, that’s expected. But the savings are well-worth it, IMO. It looks new, functions like new. I’ve been using it for six weeks now and it’s been flawless. If you can’t spend or don’t want to spend the money for brand-new, I think these phones are great.",2021年7月29日 在美国审核

Superb Renewed iphone,I waited a couple months to rate this Amazon renewed Iphone. I was quite willing to accept scratches and dings since that is normal wear and tear. This iphone is flawless in appearance and excellent to use. I saw the graphics that some said was a downside but it is not for two reasons: 1- I can't really tell any difference and I can only imagine a very few would even notice it unless professional camera people who woudn't use an iphone for that; 2- Less graphics results in superb battery life. I can use my iphone all day long reading articles and viewing videos and I still have battery at the end of the day. This is true even though this 2 year old iphone has 91% battery capacity compared to brand new. I saved hundreds of dollars by purchasing renewed by Amazon.

Great product so far!!,"I got the phone 4 days early and it came in a box but was not a Apple box and but that was disclosed in the description so I was expecting that. It also came with a charger the wall box was black but still had that new plastic wrap on it and the cord was white like a normal iPhone cord. It came with a paperclip and directions on how to set it up and a number if you needed any help(I didn't use it but it is appreciated that it was there). I switched my SIM card over and set up took less than 10 minutes including the iCloud transfer and overall was very easy. The phone got here early this morning and I have been using it since the battery came a 72% and its now almost 6 pm with battery still left. My phone says it is at 94% battery battery capacity and considering my old phone was at like 53% I consider this a major upgrade especially since the description says the battery capacity will come above 80% and I got one with 94%. It came with a screen protector and the front nor the back was cracked and I don't see any signs of scuffing around the edge. The screen works extremely well and its buttons and charging port are all working properly. I hope everything stays the way it is especially for the price.

Fantastic apple phone!,This phone was a huge upgrade in many ways from my iPhone 8! To start the amount of screen that is present is a huge upgrade. The bezel for the camera and speaker at the top is very sleek and Hardly noticeable. The camera is also fantastic! The portrait photos that you can with this phone with both cameras is fantastic! Also the screen resolution is beautiful and allows great streaming of videos. The battery life is much much stronger than the life of my older model. This phone lasts all day for me!

"So good, I bought 2. Highly recommended for a work phone!","I have a job where I could be on the phone for quite some time. I have to refresh websites constantly and my Androids were not cutting it. I never had an iphone until now and I wish I wasn't so stubborn. I spent so much on androids that would start glitching a year or so later. When I could have just gotten an iphone. I can see if you casually use your phone, but if you are a heavy user, or need for work, SO worth the switch.I bought my husband this phone, from the same seller a few months ago, and it is still working GREAT.

Wow this phone isn’t even a year old and it died!! Literally dead!!,"I am extremely unsatisfied with this purchase. I am hoping “HYRID-IT” I think the company is called, fixes this issue and makes good on their product, and I’d happily update this review if they attempt to do so. I have purchased many phones off of amazon’s market place in refurbished condition, 3 iPhone x’s, and 1 XR, and have NEVER had this happen until I got the XR.The phone was working amazing when first received in November of 2020, it is now august 14th, 2021 and it has died. YES IT LITERALLY DIED. Plugged the phone in to charge before bedtime 2 days ago, and when I woke up the screen never turned on again. I am extremely disappointed. I literally feel like I was stolen from I spent over $300 for this phone and had decently high expectations considering my success with other iPhone purchases in this marketplace; and unfortunately I am feeling as though I am high and dry now. I left the seller a message; I am praying they can do some kind of exchange; even if it involves me going a bit out of pocket, will see if they care enough to even respond. If they do again, I will update this review.***Update, HYDBRID IT MADE THINGS RIGHT.",2021年8月14日 在美国审核

Good experience ordering unlocked from tech exchange,"Just want to share some up to date feedback for those looking. If I am pleasantly surprised by an experience, I feel I owe the company some good feedback. I took a chance and ordered a renewed unlocked white iphone XR phone from this listing. Tech Exchange was the seller who fulfilled the order.-Phone arrived on time in pristine condition. I couldn't find a scratch on it.-It had a glass screen protector already applied. This was a nice bonus.-The ""battery health"" indicator in iOS showed 100%. I was expecting since it was renewed it would be off a couple percentage points.-I've activated the phone with dual sim on verizon and google fi's networks. So no issues with the phone being sim-locked.-The phone has otherwise worked flawlessly. I've had it for about 2 weeks now.I am super happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone on the fence.",2020年2月20日 在美国审核
Best Refurbished SmartPhone in 2019/2020!,"When I ordered this product, I did not expect the phone to be as great as a condition it was in. First off, the phone came with a Genuine Apple Charger (instead of those cheap 3rd party ones). Secondly, when I powered on and set up the phone, I was shocked to find out that the Phone was only 1 month old and the warranty was still good for another 11 months! And when I went to check the battery capacity, it was at 100% battery capacity and was really well taken care of. Despite all of this, I did find a few scratches on the back, but it’s hardly noticeable and everything else about this iPhone XR is flawless and I was even able to purchase AppleCare+ for only $12.99 a month. I purchased this item through ChubbiesTech and will definitely do business with this company In the near future!",2019年12月22日 在美国审核
Looks unused. 98% battery life. Charger and cable of course are not Mfi certified,"First, irrelevant part - MFi certfied cable. This one is not, and even if it says so it will not be - it's all counterfeit, that sells for few bucks on Amazon. The seller should remove this from the description not to piss of people for nothing. Also, 5W charger. Duh.

It's like new.,"Shipping was really quick, for one. It got delivered before its expected delivery date. I ordered a red iPhone XR with 128GB memory space. I knew it was a renewed product so I expected at least some minor scratches on the phone. To my surprise, the phone is immaculate. It shines beautifully, no dings, scratches, or scuffs in the slightest. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones for this, but I hope all of you get the same experience as well. Performance wise, it's lightning quick (for reference, I'm upgrading from an iPhone 7), the battery life is insanely good. It's been at 100% charge for the last half hour while in use. It doesn't heat up like my 7 does (not yet at least. So far it's been staying very cool). The camera is awesome. Should make for some good shots. It feels and performs like a brand new phone in every way. Highly recommend the buy. I'm happy with mine, and I hope you guys will be happy with yours too. Cheers.",2020年5月8日 在美国审核

You’ll be surprised,"I’ve bought iPhones new ever since 2006 when I bought the very first model. I’ve never ever considered refurbished especially for a phone, but I decided to take a risk. Mainly because I REALLY wanted the XR in blue in 256gb and Apple stopped offering this model (to entice you towards the more recent models). I wanted to get the best XR I could because it’s the last LCD display by Apple w the best battery. I want this phone to last 3-5 years. I spent $580 after tax, and I got what cost $1000 about a year and a half ago. There’s not a single scratch on my phone, the battery life came with 100% health! It honestly feels like someone owned this phone for less than a week, and gave it back and it was “refurbished”. Very impressed, can’t believe I got a brand new battery.

Excellent,"I was a bit skeptical purchasing a used (renewed) iPhone, but the phone I received is exactly as described in the advertisement on Amazon.There is a very very slight scratch in the upper right corner.You need to hold the phone at a close distance and at a certain angle to see it.The advertisement mentioned minimal cosmeticdamage, which is not noticeable at arms length.The ad also guaranteed to have a minimum battery capacity of 80%.On inspection, my battery is 100%, and the phone is still covered by Apple warranty.I am satisfied with my purchase and the phone is in excellent condition. Some buyers are giving the seller low reviews because of the generic charger, cable and missing headphones.The following was taken directly from the advertisement:“Box and accessories (no headphones included) may be generic”.Some people refuse to be responsible for their actions, and always look for others to blame.Don’t blame the seller because you failed to read and understand the advertisement.",2020年1月24日 在美国审核

Well, boy was I proven wrong! My phone came fully unlocked as it stated and all I had to do was pop my Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into this iPhone XR and it worked! It started the setup process immediately. All apps work, calling, texting, settings, are working.

Absolutely Love It!,"My phone came about 36 hours after I bought it. I had done a bunch of research before buying it and found that for MY needs, this was quite an upgrade from my iPhone 7.

I took it to Verizon to get help in changing the SIM card and transferring my info, but it came with everything to do it yourself. My son had offered to help me. I’m just not savvy in that way! Once it was up mr running? Have to say…I love my Premium Renewed iPhone XR. It’s lightweight, has a great camera and I was able to get plenty of battery, at such a good price.

I was pleased that the seller I got it from included a case and screen protector with it (not sure if they all come with those).

Awesome product!,"I received my XR, 256GB Black, two days ago to replace two iPhone 6 64GB units I have used since 2015. It has been worth every cent!

The device arrived in a generic box and with a generic Lightning cable (which looks and feels much better than the original Lightning cable from Apple) as indicated by the seller but the unit itself is like new. I even have Apple Care for one year from the date of purchase. There is not a scratch or blemish anywhere to be found, whether on the front or back.The XR is obviously a huge step forward from the 6, which is starting to show its age.

Why did I wait so long to buy and i-Phone?,Bought this refurbished and love it. Came in a plain white box with a charging wire and no AC charger but I have quite a few that work with the lighting wire. This phone's battery is such that I can go all day and still have 50% left on the battery. Still learning some aspects of the i-Phone but it is much more responsive than the cheat Moto 5 plus android model I bought so as to not pay leasing fees.

The setup was literally under 15 minutes, and it took only 2 seconds to switch my SIM card to this phone and my service was automatically connected. Also for those who want to know, this is compatible with cricket. I am a cricket customer and you literally only have to change the SIM card over, now I was coming from a iPhone 6 so I had to flip my sim upside down to fit in properly. If you don’t feel uncomfortable doing it yourself you can totally go in a store and have them do it and it’s FREE! Wish I had pictures but I’m currently using it! :). Also it doesn’t come with headphones but I did purchase AirPods, plus I had my own set of headphones, it does come with a charger.

Great Condition!,"I was very hesitant to buy a used phone. It's hard to know exactly what you are going to get. Of course, you want to believe it is going to be perfect but you do have to be realistic, because it's used. I'm happy to report the phone was nearly perfect. It has no scratches at all, no marks or anything negative about the appearance. I took it to get a sim card and everything transferred perfectly from my old phone. I didn't miss a beat. I know some people are particular about this one but I did get an Apple brand charging cable too. The battery was full and it lasts a long time! I go all day with using various apps and phone calls and even use it with the controller while flying my drone. At bedtime, around 1:00am, I still have about 50% battery left from the charge the night before. The only thing weird is the iPhone podcast app does not work. It says ""There is a problem and the Podcast Library needs to be rebuilt before continuing."" When I click Rebuild Library, it never finishes doing anything. I have even kept touching the screen to keep the phone from going to sleep in hopes that the rebuild would be successful. I eventually deleted the app and re-downloaded it from the App Store. Everything seemed to be fine and then... I got the same message. I will eventually take it to the Apple Store to see what they can do but for now, the rest is perfect and I am glad I saved a few hundred bucks.",2019年10月8日 在美国审核
Not perfect but still an upgrade!,"1. I got the phone in the male several days EARLY which made me so very happy.2.

The charger works well and it’s lasted almost a month now.4. Now for the phone review, I love it so much. It came with 88% battery life which isn’t the best but it’s okay because it is definitely an upgrade from an iPhone 7 or 8, the battery lasts probably around 4 - 5 hours with heavy usage such as watching shows, videos, etc. The screen came with a glass screen protector on it.5. I was a little upset to see that the camera has dings on it. Like it was banged up by the precious owner. For a refurbished phone I was honestly just happy I could upgrade whether the phone had a little ding on the camera.

Very satisfied with IPhone Xr 128gb,"I was very satisfied with my iPhone XR. I had a battery, 2 screens and a camera replaced all due to user abuse. It was working good but the front cam was getting squirrelly and had been told my frame had a bend that would make cam replacement hard(???). I purchased this phone to replace that phone before it quit and that way I’d have a backup for emergencies. I saw the price for this phone and figured why not. This refurb phone is in great shape, I should say it’s like new (it’s that nice) and it functions as if new. If you don’t need the latest but want to be in the Apple ecosystem with no ties to a carrier this is a good way to go.",2022年1月21日 在美国审核

ITS okay.....,"As of right now very satisfied with this phone. It came with a charging cable and block, but the phone is working great. I was SUPER skeptical at first. Seeing all the negative reviews, about stolen phones and locked phones. But those really negative reviews were a couple years old, so I kept a positive outlook. The phone is quick and much better than my iPhone 7 which served me very well for its time and age, and overall this phone is in mint condition. It has a couple of surface scratches on the screen but nothing major. As for its battery life I was kinda disappointed with it being barely at 89% but other than that a great phone. Approved by me. Hope this sits well with anyone attempting to pull the trigger on this phone.",2020年12月5日 在美国审核

So far so good,I got this for my son after his last phone was broken. This was a cheaper option than our local refurbished phone store. I was nervous about the quality but we received a nice phone with no major marks or anything. There was like a tiny scratch on the corner of the screen when held at a specific angle it was visible but not bad. Everything else has been fine.

Great phone for the price.,"So my wife was in the market for a new iPhone, upgrading from her iPhone 6, which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work. I couldn't bring myself to pay Apple 800 dollars or more for a new basic phone. I tried to get my wife to agree to an Android and that wasn't going to happen. Then I found these Amazon Renewed phones. I wound up saving about 175 dollars on an almost new iPhone Xr.<br>The phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible, less the original packaging and equipment. The box was a repackage box, the power adapter was an unknown USB wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a week.The migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour, with an iOS upgrade in for good measure (this phone came with 12.2 and 12.4 has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to current).Overall, happy about the phone. Time will tell if I run into issues with it lasting but so far all is good.</br>",2019年9月6日 在美国审核

Most likely just from everyday usage, but do keep in mind that it's refurbished, not new, so it won't be perfect, but I know this $380 phone vs the $700 new one is far far better. (For those concerned about the quality, I have no scratches on my screen or lens, not a bit of lag between multiple apps, and no issue with battery life, because trust me I was just as concerned and took a leap of faith)",2021年5月31日 在美国审核
"Phone had No Defects..PERFECT CONDITION! However, both sim cards didn't work in phone immediately.","Although the phone arrived dead, once it charged up, it seemed to be running okay. The health of the battery was also 100%!!! As an unlocked phone,it did not register for my Verizon or Tmobile. It kept indicating phone not allowed for both sim cards. Since I was using it for tmobile and the IMEI was not recognized online, I had to call and the process was completed in 5 minutes and the phone worked instantly.The seller does indicate on the box, not to provide the IMEI number, but in this situation I had to, since it did not work for both carriers, but I did not encounter any problems with the t-mobile representative.",2020年8月29日 在美国审核
Amazing,"I was looking all over Amazon for a new phone (cos other stores are too expensive for me) and they all had pretty bad reviews. This one I can 100% recommend. Came with a charger and a charger block. DOESNT COME WITH HEADPHONES, which for me is fine, it’s a cheap iPhone off of Amazon what do you expect. It came in the mail around 2pm and I’m writing this at 8pm, with me on it that whole time it’s on only 30%. Which I can say is better than my old phone which I got from Verizon. The only thing I would say is bad about it is the box and bag it came in, the phone itself was kinda just thrown in (?) no real protection from it cracking. Just keep that in mind if your local mailing service isn’t careful with packages.",2021年4月3日 在美国审核
No hesitation…,I have my doubts about “refurbished” technology however the price is paid for new.Given value I put my confidence in Amazon and am not disappointed.

Practically new!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"Some background: I have had the phone for one week. My previous phone was an iPhone SE, so this was a huge upgrade. I am a masters student balling on a budget. I typically keep a phone for 3 to 4 years (until it completely stops working) so I was looking for a bargain without substituting quality.Better than I ever could have hoped! The iPhone XR arrived a day early (even in a time of pandemic) in a generic box with a generic charging cord. I put in my SIM card and set up the phone in less than an hour- no issues. I checked the battery health and it is at 97% capacity. I expect like with most iPhones that the battery lifespan will be about 2-3 years before I must replace it. I am very happy with this! No broken buttons, screen damage or anything! For over $150 in savings compared to a new device, I am blown away by the quality.

I also got yellow because it was the cheapest option for me.It has been a week. Good so far. It was unlocked, had no cosmetic damage and I had to set it up with my iCloud account just like normal. It’s been great and I’ll update if it’s not.Edit: I had the phone for nearly two years before I replaced it but it was still useable. It was great all in all.",2019年12月15日 在美国审核

LOVE IT,I bought this phone off of amazon and was very hesitant about this because I was unable to hold it and see if I actually like it. Well this product did not disappoint. Not only is this phone more affordable than any phone at Verizon but I have had it for a year now and it is working just like it was when I got it out of the package. Also it is not hard to transfer the phone on to an already existing account with some one like Verizon. Even though it is a lot of money out of the pocket it is still cheaper than purchasing a phone in store because it has helped me save on my monthly bill a TON! So yes BUY THIS PRODUCT,2020年4月23日 在美国审核

BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Phone is not unlocked to carriers and when you try to add it to any service provider they will say the imei number is invalid meaning it’s not a real device.

After reaching out multiple times, I get a message saying “unfortunately the time is damaged and we can’t refund you because we don’t cover physical damage”. I made them aware that the item wasn’t damaged when I shipped it! THE WHOLE ISSUE IS THIS PHONE HAS A FALSE IMEI # AND CANNOT CONNECT TO CARRIERS So it’s basically a brick. All they keep saying is they can’t do anything. I’m pretty sure the phone was intentionally cracked so that they could continue with there scam and not refund me. I didn’t even ask for an actual refund. I just wanted the phone unlocked the way it is advertised. So now I’m out of $500 with a brick... that’s now magically cracked.

When I received mine, it looked brand new, worked perfectly, and I've gotta say, if you're looking to switch ecosystems, this is the way to go. File transfer was easy, and after struggling to decide about switching from an android (galaxy s8), I really feel like I made the right call.",2020年10月23日 在美国审核

Awesome,"I've been struggling with Android for years trying to save money over Apple. Finally I had had enough and decided to get an unlocked iPhone XR 256 (White) from Amazon (Renewed).<br>What can I say?This phone is awesome. It's fast, it's all-screen, it's unlocks and logs into things using your face. It's solid. Sound quality is great. I feel like I'm using a REAL tool and not a toy.It does't detect very weak cellular signal well, but it doesn't drop calls either. I don't accidentally hit the mute button like on my old iPhone and Android phones.Battery life is good, but not great (about a day and a half with light usage). Downloads are LIGHTNING fast (50MB in less than four seconds over my 175mbps broadband). It downloadeded my old Zen Pinball tables almost instantly.What I don't like:No headphone jack. Back is glass and easily slides off furniture and tables (I keep finding it on the floor). Volume buttons are on the left side instead of right.Everything else?Perfect. This phone is a pleasure to use and Amazon sells it at about HALF the price of new retail. Battery Health was at 95% when received. No cracks or scratches. Generic crappy power connector included (but who doesn't already have 50?). No headphones included (big whoop).If you want to save some money and get a REAL phone this one is a winner.</br>",2020年9月23日 在美国审核

ONE WAS COOL... ONE WAS HOTTTTTTTTTTT!,"I bought 2 of these iPhone XR's.My sons was great, he had it up and running in just a few minutes!<br>I didn't have the same luck.First the unit was scratched... (I had never purchased anything ""renewed"" so that was a surprise to me... ) it also had a sizeable crack/dent on the lower right corner... which was also a shock.But I figured that is just how refurbished phones looked... the camera looked pristine...and that is why I wanted a newer iPhone model... so I was okay with it.The trouble started when I was setting up the phone... this sucker started getting HOT!I thought it was because it was being activated... or something... again... I have NEVER purchased a refurbished phone... so I had no idea.Then after set up... I was done using it.I sat it on my nightstand and didn't think about it again.When my daughter called me later that afternoon, I picked up the phone... and it was HOTTTTTTTTTTTTT...I mean iron your clothes hot...I asked my son if he was experiencing the same thing... and he was not... I asked my daughter if any of her iPhone had ever burned her hand... her answer was ""no"" as well... so I had to return the phone...as something much be wrong with it.I went to print out my return label... and noticed the seller has written that all returned phones with incur a 15% RESTOCKING FEE!So you're telling me... YOU CAN SELL ME A DAMAGED PHONE... AND GET $40-$50 bucks PROFIT?So there is NO incentive to EVER care about sending out good products?That could be a second stream of business all to itself... sell a damaged phone... get money on the return... rinse and repeat!I WILL BE FIGHTING THIS TOOTH AND NAIL!This is OUTRAGEOUS!</br>",2021年5月13日 在美国审核

Great Purchase So Far Despite a Couple of Minor Issues,"This is my first phone purchase in almost a decade. I am going from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone XR.I asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iPhone. I have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed. I was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so I gave it a try.So far I am happy with my purchase. The iPhone is in like new condition with no major scratches. However, there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen. They are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the LCD screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phone.When it comes to the actual phone itself, the big screen, sound quality, and fast processor are something to smile about. Apple outdid themselves with this phone. The only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design. I find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand. I think there is an adjustment period. The phone was incredibly easy to set-up. I just had to back my old iPhone up to iTunes and then restore that backup on the XR.I do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has 64g storage but this can be overlooked. (I know that I also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack I just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this item.)Pros-Great price. Fast shipping time. Sold from someone trustworthy. Honest listing and as described. Came with screen protector and SIM removal tool. The phone indicates that the battery life is at 95%.As a phone, great quality overall. The LCD screen is big and bright. The sound is fantastic. The processor is super fast (I think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphone).Cons-The phone came with a knockoff charger not an OEM (original) Apple charger or headphones. Yes, using an Apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference, look into it if you do not believe me. Fortunately I have my old Apple chargers. The screen has a couple miner indented scratches. My finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when I record videos. The audio gets blocked or becomes scratchy.I made this review as detailed as possible because I greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phone.One major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue. I think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone. When you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency. For a couple of hundred dollars more I could have bought straight from Apple, but I am happy I got to save that money.",2020年6月3日 在美国审核

internal speaker,"I ordered this phone as a xmas gift to myself.I had a very hard time hearing on the phone, to the point that I actually made an appointment with an ENT specialist.I was convinced I was suffering from hearing loss.After a clean bill of health, I realized the problem was with the phone.I could hear fine if using the speaker function, but couldn't hear if the phone was held up to my ear.I took the phone to the Apple authorized service center and was told there was a problem with both internal speakers and that I would have to send it off to Apple for repair for a whopping cost of $490.I recognized this was a ""renewed"" phone when I purchased it, but they apparently didn't address the issue with the internal speakers.I reached out to the seller who informed me my request was outside of the warranty period.Now I'm stuck with having to use the phone only on speaker function whichis extremely inconvenient for me (total loss of privacy) and disturbing to those around me",2020年3月30日 在美国审核

So Glad I Switched!,"I was a die-hard android fan, until I bought this iPhone. The XR is big and a nice weight. Out of box beautiful...as you can from the pics. I am still working through the differences in Apple products and Microsoft products. The only thing I don't like is there is no plug-in head phone capability and you can't download your music to the phone itself, but those are things I can live without easily as everything is cloud-based. Great buy and I bought it here at a fraction of the cost on the Apple site, I really like that especially. For those switching to Apple products watch your data use, you may have to purchase more data as Apple products use a lot of data, so take your phone off data while you have Wi-Fi access. The major thing I like about the switch is I will not be buying a new phone every two or three years!!!!",2021年2月12日 在美国审核

Husband and I spent hours trying to get this through set up,"We are very familiar with I-phones and set up.This one was a nightmare we could not overcome.I spent an hour on it and then my husband tried for over an hour.Locked up and just ""spinned"" half way through set up.Consulted google and youtube - no help.Hardly able to get back to reset before returning phone.Not sure I was able to remove everything as just locked up and unable to get to ""Settings"" to confirm everything out.Can I say nightmare one more time !On top of that, the packing tells me that unless I go to settings and confirm that google and apple passwords are out, that my refund may be delayed and I may pay a restocking fee.Total waste of time and not sure of security.Will now have to change all my Apple passwords etc to be sure that I did not return phone with information on it.Will never try this again.",2022年1月25日 在美国审核

1st Time Apple iPhone User,"The phone I received was by all estimations brand new. Not a mark on it and fully charged. However, being new to the Apple World, I can honestly say Windows &amp; Android are both in plain, simple, super easy to understand English. Apple is not. Even its keyboard is not a full Standard Keyboard, like it is with Windows &amp; any Google machine. Android is Google, that's why I say it that way. No getting around it. Just keeping it short &amp; to the point. Apple's iPhone keyboard takes extreme amount of effort to use because it is not the Standard keyboard of every other operating system. Thankfully, I was able to connect a Bluetooth keyboard to it. Otherwise, it's a serious no-go for keyboard use.As for Apple's iPhone Touchscreen, again, I find it sorely lacking. There's no such thing as the simple pinch &amp; zoom on it. That particular luxury seems to be found only within the Camera &amp; Picture sections. You'd think it'd at least be within the iBook section but it's not. On most everything Windows or Google, every app is not just touch &amp; activate, but also affords the luxury of pinch &amp; zoom as well as easy swipe &amp; easy app close &amp; dismiss. Can't say that about the Apple iPhone.And for some unknown reason its WiFi also keeps turning itself on. I can't seem to keep it off no matter how often I manually turn it off.For Apple being so USER-FRIENDLY, I cannot at all say that it is. In fact, IT IS ANYTHING BUT USER-FRIENDLY.If the Apple World was so user-friendly, then it would be a very simple and easy transition from the Windows or Google platform to Apple. And I can honestly say it is Not at all simple or easy. I was so hoping it would be as simple &amp; easy as my Windows machine &amp; Android phone, but sadly, it's actually quite maddening.If you enjoy Kindle reads, you'll need to install the app for it. But I can also tell you, Apple's iBook seriously pales in comparison to Kindle. Ironically, the Google Search Engine is installed on Apple's iPhone but Kindle is not. I avoid Google anything &amp; everything as much as can be done. But for Apple to deny Amazon's Kindle Apple on its phones, seems almost a crime.I have yet to install the Kindle reading app or to test out the camera on the iPhone. When I do I'll update my review. But currently I can't say it's anything to brag about. And I most certainly did not expect to see Google's Search Engine/Web Browser on it.Size wise, it's the exact same size as my Sony Xperia Z3v. It still functions quite well. Not perfect, but well enough for me since I have it locked to call, text, Kindle reads &amp; camera.I can easily read, pinch &amp; zoom &amp; highlight my Kindle reads, pictures &amp; text messages on it. Can only do that with pictures on the iPhone. So for it being so great, I actually find it quite limiting. Not because it's an iPhone, but because the Apple creators decided to create a platform that is quite complex and extremely arduous to use. Apple created its own ""language"" that must be learned in order to navigate the complexities of its Eco-system.Even now, trying to login to the Apple App Store, no keyboard appears so I can actually install Apps necessary for my personal use. Yet you're required to sign in to it. How can you sign into the App Store when NO KEYBOARD APPEARS TO LET YOU?! So, even if I did not want to use the phone feature, but instead use it as a computer tablet, I cannot because it won't let me login to the App Store. ... Like I said, to anyone new to the Apple world, it's quite a infuriatingly maddening conundrum. If Apple wants to gain new customers and retain them, then Apple needs to change how it operates. And if Apple is supposed to be the safest of all online platforms, then it should not sport Google's web browser.The phone I received was/is like brand new. Operating it though, takes considerable patients as it is quite the learning curve. It should not be so difficult to transition from Windows, Android or Google to Apple. They all made sense to everybody from the moment they came out because they were in simple English and easily understood and simple to navigate because of it. Apple on the other hand, not by a long shot. Even Apple's touchscreen capabilities sorely lacks in comparison. And that's sad. You'd think their touchscreen capabilities would be at least on-par with Windows, Google &amp; Android but it is not. You'd think Apple's touchscreen capabilities might even be better than Windows, Android &amp; Google, but no. Thus far I can find nothing to brag about regarding Apple anything. I was so hoping to find something better about Apple. Instead, I'm greatly disappointed and left seriously frustrated.The iPhone itself came fully charged and appears in brand new condition. It also came with an original Apple Charger.I give the seller a stellar 5 star rating, along with the iPhone I received.I give Apple itself a mediocre 3, even 2 star rating.So to anyone new to the Apple world, maybe an iPad would be easier to use. I started with a phone since I need both a new phone &amp; a new computer and figured Apple would be a serious upgrade to Windows and for sure compared to Google's Android. ... Apple is not at all user-friendly to a first time user. Only Windows, Google &amp; Android can actually claim user-friendly bragging rights, from day one for any first time user.Apparently I need either direct Apple support or YouTube's Apple education in order to learn how to make the best use of this phone.I don't fault the phone for anything. It's an Apple thing. It's very nearly like you gotta go to MIT to learn it. And that's just not right.Will update as I learn how to navigate Apple's world &amp; extremely clunky Eco-system.1st Time Apple iPhone User Assessment. -Phone - good. - can't give it high marks due to Apple itself.Apple - not worth all the money &amp; certainly nothing to brag about.",2020年8月10日 在美国审核

WHY WILL IT NOT WORK?,"This phone was a replacement for an iPhone 7plus with 125GB.It was activated, and it seam to work fine. However, it has had several episodes where it will not work. I mean, it just goes dead during a call or just trying to use it. The problem is under consideration to have it replaced for a properly working unit.Please advise, and let's make this a win-win. UPDATE! 02152022 - 03092022. The unit continues to speratically stop functioning and is now a liability. I hope the company works with my company to make this right! please contact buyer to help resolve this matter as soon as possible. Not a Happy Customer/Business",2021年5月8日 在美国审核

Amazon does NOT honor Renew Premium!!!,"I paid for the Amazon Renewed PREMIUM for the 1 year warranty.When I rcvd the phone, it took me all day to setup cause the phone had to update first.After I had it setup and my info uploaded onto it, I immediately noticed issues.1) The ringer was extremely muffled on incoming calls.2) The touch screen was not responsive much of the time.3) The screen would not go into sleep mode and lock when pushing the power button without pushing it multiple times.Given that it was an Amazon Renewed Premium phone (supposed to be like new), I wanted a replacement phone.Which is one of the options listed on the Renewed Premium terms.BUT when I contacted Amazon TWICE I was told they could not send me a replacement.They said I would have to return it, then, (AFTER I received my refund), I would have to reorder another one.The price of the phone had already gone up and it took a week for Amazon to issue my refund AFTER they received the phone back!!!And now they don’t even have the phone available!!Don’t waste your money on Amazon Renewed PREMIUM because Amazon does NOT honor their own terms!!",2021年8月19日 在美国审核

Seller does not back their products.,"I purchased this phone exactly six months ago, and the screen digitizer has already gone bad. The cost of fixing the issue isn’t much less than buying a new phone. After asking the seller for a refund or a replacement, I was told I’m beyond my 90 days and they will do nothing for me. For what I paid for this phone, I don’t understand why they do not stand behind it. If I had dropped it or broke it I could understand, but to just have a phone go bad for no reason? They should give me some sort of a replacement, prorate the cost toward a new phone, or do something. Instead, they said they will do nothing for me. I strongly recommend you do not buy products from this seller.",2021年7月2日 在美国审核

Renewed Premium FTW,"I just finished setting up my XR. I bought a red 64 GB from Renewed Premium for $440. The phone is in mint condition with 100% battery health. I am very pleased, especially considering the fact that I have 1 whole year to return the phone for a full refund. I have no current plans to do so because I love the phone so far, but that’s an incredible deal. So for $60 less than retail I basically got a new phone with a 1 year window to return with 0 risk (unless I seriously damage the phone for whatever reason). Give Renewed a try, especially if you can get a phone with Renewed Premium.",2020年12月10日 在美国审核

"Arrived with cracked screen, Spend the extra $99 &amp; buy new from Apple!","I figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by Amazon for a refurbished iPhone XR it would be worth it to save $99 by ordering a refurbished for $500 rather than order a brand new one from Apple for $599.When I first opened the box, updated the phone and got it set up with my apps, everything was great. Then I went to the Apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories. When I was putting on the screen protector I noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen. It appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen. I’ve taken photos to share.I ordered this phone as I’m traveling and needed a new phone. Well I have no choice but to eat this scam by Amazon and the seller because I’m traveling and don’t have an option to not use this phone.Amazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale.

Battery not at 100%,"I spent almost a month with this phone and their hasn't been any problems with data, battery, calls, quality, or anything else. I switched from an iphone 6s, which doesn't turn on anymore, and it is amazing not having to charge 2-3 times a day. This battery is fine throughout the whole day with mild to intense use. With mild use and school going on, the battery can last me almost 2 days. I've seen reviews where the battery comes at 100% but mine was not included in those cases. My phone came at 92% and that annoys me a little but it's worth the 100 dollars I save by not buying it from the apple store. I am not sure about waterproofing but my phone came without a scratch or a chip on the aluminum paint. It was like it was new besides for the fact of the battery. I was really happy with it but another annoying thing was that they didn't require a signature with the delivery, my neighbors have stolen airpods that I've ordered before so I was quite annoyed by the fact that they just left it in the mail box without making me personally accept it or sign for it. Beware about that if you live in a shady neighborhood or busy street.",2020年1月30日 在美国审核
