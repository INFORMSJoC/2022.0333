THIS PHONE WAS NOT PAYED OFF,"I purchased a refurbished iPhone x, it arrived on time, came in clean , and with a charger.... i was excited about this phone because my other phone was stolen 3 months ago, i got a job and saved up to be able to afford a new one. We tried to set up the service with total wireless and the phone kept repeating the message that the sim card was not compatible.... so we bought another sim card and service plan by t mobile and got the same thing.... went into apple the next day to try to see if their was anything wrong with the phone... turns out their was nothing wrong with the phone, but the phone already had another service plan with at&amp;t that wasn't even payed off.... so after wasting 10 hours off my time, and spending $60 (besides the $690 phone price)trying to set this stupid phone up with a service plan... i would review this 0 stars if i could",2019年4月17日 在美国审核
Exceeded Expectations,"I was very skeptical when ordering this product because of the negative reviews, but this was MORE than worth the money. Had no scratches or anything. Worst thing I found was cosmetic wear on the edges (in the picture uploaded). Battery is at 92% capacity and it works like a dream.

"Great Phone, Nearly Perfect","So before I made this purchase, I read through a lot of reviews on a lot of different sellers who had iPhone X's for sale. This one seemed to have the most consistent positive stream of reviews, although every single listing I came across had at least a few people reporting bad experiences. Buying something Amazon Renewed seems like it's always a risk, so I suppose you may have a bad experience, but the phone I received came on time, and was essentially in flawless condition. It came with a tempered glass screen protector already on, and the battery health was at 92%, supporting peak performance capabilities. The cameras are crisp, no damage to them at all, and the speakers sound great. No SIM/WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity issues whatsoever, and really I was pleasantly surprised at how great this phone is. The only thing was that in a couple of the crevices on the phone, chiefly around the camera's protrusion, there was a tiny bit of dirt/grime, but a toothpick and alcohol did the trick. Overall I would say this is a great purchase, as iPhone X's are currently going for $899+tax (new) from Best Buy, and this was almost new for $559+tax (~$611). Would recommend!",2019年11月7日 在美国审核

That is a shame. :( For those who question my knowledge, I took it directly to Verizon and they also tried multiple sim cards in it and none worked. The phone continued to display NO SERVICE.

Absolutely disgusted!!!!,"I purchased an iPhone X. The whole reason I made this purchase was because it was “Amazon guaranteed”. It arrived on a Thursday; Immediately when the phone arrived I noticed issues. Upon making my first call, the phone would turn off and the restart 5 or 6 times in a row, not even allowing me to access the Home Screen. So I called Amazon. I talked to Ryan E.A “customer support representative” at Amazon. Ryan gave three possible options1) bring the phone to an Apple store and they will either fix the problem or replace it,2) return the item with possible two week reimbursement.3) ship it to Apple and they would fix the problemI chose to set up an appointment at the Apple store to have the problem fixed.At which point Ryan E. Booked the appointment for me, over the phone, with an Apple representative as it was a Amazon guaranteed product. Tuesday I drove 200 miles away to the Apple store. The Apple representative performed a diagnostic and informed me the main processing chip was faulty and therefore the phone needed to be replaced and they even had the exact replacement in store. As Amazon had already verified everything would be taken care of cost wise, I called Amazon to provide a “geniusbar work authorization &amp; service confirmation” form for replacement as it would cost $549.00. Ashley C, who told me that they would not pay for the replacement and the only option for me was to return the product and get a refund. I then told Ashley exactly what Ryan told me. Ashley said I was wrong and that amazon did not set up an appointment for an apple store repair, and that I would need to prove the appointment was made by a representative of amazon. When I explained that I had email verification she then said ""I see the email"" then refused to follow through on replacement even though and told me that my only option was to return the phone or keep it upon bringing up what amazon had previously promised like magic I was disconnected. At that point since I had an appointment and I didn't want to take up anyone else's time; I decided to leave. When I got back to my car, I once again decided to call Amazon. This time while talking with the representative Ashley I was told that the phone I purchased was not amazon guaranteed, even though the actual iPhone X amazon listing specifically says ""Amazon Guaranteed; eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days"". Furthermore, Ashley told me that a return and refund is my only option I brought up that amazon listed the product under Amazon guaranteed specifically states ""Quick support for claims and troubleshooting. Eligible for replacement or refund within 90 days of receipt if you are not satisfied."" she continued by stating the product was not amazon guaranteed and stated that the listing is removed and they can't do anything further. When I asked to speak to a manager I was transferred to Sam G. who by the way was incredibly rude, and refused to help me in any way and refused to replace the product, or assist me with anything other that returning the iPhone. I am disgusted at the way this whole situation has been handled. Even after reviewing amazons guaranteed policy I still cannot find where it states amazon has the ability to refuse to follow through with their guaranteed product replacement. I do know that I will not only be bringing this up with the BBB but also the attorney general.",2021年1月20日 在美国审核

It was what I expect ,Now for the people who are reading this message it is important for you to know. if you want a really good offer for a really cheap price go ahead and take the chance Buy this iPhone. There’s no scam is the real deal. now note this you are buying a used iPhone. Second thing that you need to keep in mind Is the battery capacity if you’re looking for a phone you want to try to aim for 95% battery capacity is your best bet when I received mine I got it at 80% battery capacity so that’s also another thing to keep in mind when you’re buying a used phone make sure you’re looking at that battery capacity it’s really important another thing you will receive scratches on the display and the back glass in my opinion this is nothing to cry over just throw a case on it and it should look pretty good. you also want to make sure that your face recognition is on point make sure that everything on the phone is responsive after Unboxing thank you guys so much for taking your time in reading this long message hopefully you bought your product and enjoyed it.

Easy to set up. I honestly feel like it’s a new phone. The first thing I checked was the battery health and it was 100%! Everything functions perfectly. Love the Face ID. Great camera and sound. Once you get used to no home button, you won’t miss it. Without it the screen fills the whole phone. So the overall phone size is not too big, but you get more screen size - a win win in my opinion.

I had read reviews saying the phone would not turn on, so this was a bit concerning as I pressed that side button, fingers crossed that luck would still be in my favor. It was almost fully charged!! Now the last test. Was the phone paid off? Truly unlocked for any service?? I had also read reviews saying the phones could not be used on network due to not being paid off or in some cases even stolen!So I called my service provider, gave them the imei and my phone number and it was switched over without any issues at all.I am SUPER SUPER happy with my purchase!!

Not as they claim,"This item is claimed to be a ""functioning like new"" device, but this is NOT TRUE AT ALL. Let me walk through this dramatic tragedy in detail.I had been monitoring the package from the moment after purchase, so it wasn't an accident that on that bright, sunny day I was waiting by the mailbox as the delivery truck cruised in. Grabbing my package, I ran inside, ecstatic at the prospect of my newest gadget. Gazing at that chrome-plated beauty, I knew love at first sight was true.As I set up this electronic treasure, I tap into ""settings"" to feast my eyes on the sight you rarely see in an iPhone... the battery at full capacity reader proudly gleaming a 100% like-new condition. But no, what sight met my eyes gave me a horror as you would not believe. Eighty....... Three...... Percent...... Now my mind was racing. I had already vowed til death do us part, but now looking at my bride's screen I realized what I had to do. I needed a second doctors opinion. I scheduled an appointment as soon as we returned from the honeymoon with Apple Memorial Hospital, and settled in to an uneasy vacation with my new love.... it was then that tragedy struck.As I started editing a slow motion video of a man breaking an egg on his forehead, the screen flickered and died. I gently tried to shake her awake, hitting the power and volume button up and down (Mainly down. A volume button being obviously a huge plus on a wife) As I rushed her to the ER at the nearest Apple Memorial Hospital I feared the worst. And the worst is what I got. Her heart, (known as a smart board) had failed. She would never speak to me again. I never saw her eyes open since that day, and I'll never forget the last image I saw of her, as the egg was making it's final impact on that man's head.I don't tell this story for self pity. I realize that this may be emotional for many of you to recall similar moments in your life's past. Perhaps even recent past. I share this only from a place of love and concern for other members of this community in the Amazon, that you don't make the same mistakes as I did. I will add one last word and say I have found support groups especially helpful during this emotional time. Thank you all for your time, and I hope you never buy.. *ahem, marry*a bride from this father-in-law.Happy phone hunting!",2019年9月19日 在美国审核
iPhone in good condition,"It came in a plain white box with a functional charger (not original) and no headphones. The phone was covered with a clear plastic and had really minor scuffs (barely noticeable, I used a bright white light to search for scratches) at the base of the phone around the speaker and charging port. I would describe the appearance as excellent.No issues with setup. I tested camera, video call, video recording, phone call, touch screen and Bluetooth connectivity to fitbit, speakers and car. Everything worked fine. Works like a new phone. Battery health is at 84% (I wish it was over 95%) but it works much better than my old iPhone and I'll replace the battery in time if it does not hold charge. It got a bit hot while using it which I'll assume had to do with the phone consuming a lot of data from the installation and setup process.This phone was purchased for use in Trinidad &amp; Tobago on bmobile network. It connected easily without an issues therefore the phone is unlocked as stated. This was my first 24 hours with the phone and I'm very pleased with this renewed purchase. Synergy was the only seller that I found with little negative reviews and I am glad and feel relief that I chose this seller.If there are any issues within the next few weeks, I'll update this review.Update April 2020: With regular FaceTime use I realised that that is a minor flaw with the camera. The screen has intermittent black flashes that last for a second. I've noticed it and the person on the other end of the call noticed it. Other than that, the phone works as described.",2020年1月8日 在美国审核

Phone arrived and works like brand new.,"4/29: Wow! I really thought that this could go south, however, once it arrived it was working as a brand new iPhone, luckily I had a key to open the SIM tray, otherwise I would have had a hard time finding a way to open it. It's been now almost 3 weeks since first started to use the phone and not one trace of a damage or defect has been found and I like all of the features it includes. Kudos to the seller Electronic Deals who sent this one like new and made me happy for the upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone X.UPDATE 6/9: This phone has not failed at all since first use, the only detail is that when you turn it back on, unless it is plugged to the charger wire, it will take a lot of time to boot up, other than that, there are absolutely no complains for this product.Update 3/24/21: The phone has made it so far intact, not a single damage from falls (my hands are so slippery sometimes) and though the battery is two years old or more (as the phone as well) it doesn’t take long to lose the charge and when it’s at 1% it takes longer to turn off.It has issues with face recognition at some point, but those were more of a software issue than hardware.

Very Happy,"I bought this renewed iPhone X for my wife, who was very reluctant to upgrade from her v7 iPhone. The reason for this was during her last upgrade 6 years ago, she lost most of her contacts and photos. However, this upgrade was flawless. Apple has improved this process so well that even my techno-phobic wife found it impressive. The entire process took about five hours to complete, as it transferred all her contacts, notes, pictures, apps and everything. The only glitch I had was after installing the SIM card.The phone dropped the first 3 calls she made, so I checked the SIM card, reseated it, and that fixed the problem.The phone itself was in very good shape. In fact, it looked brand-new. My wife loves the face recognition (not on v7). The battery life seems good, it's lasting the entire day.

Absolutely 0 issues and problems since the day we got these iPhone X. Both phones we got are fully unlocked. We used both iPhones under VodaFone when we lived in Italy until May 2019. Now, one iPhone X uses AT&amp;T and the other uses Verizon. This just to show that the product description remains true, it is 100% unlocked.

Glass back is the same with no visible scratching from arm length or even close inspection. Camera and glass lens cover work very well.At 92% battery life is still good, as ""Renewed Premium"" says battery will be 90% or better. The only visible flaw were a few very light scratches on the bezel but are barely noticeable. I have a case covering it now so its very out of sight and out of mind. The phone also came in an Amazon Renewed branded box with a generic but new phone charger set with some warranty info.There is supposedly a 20 point inspection the phone had about 9 weeks ago according to the warranty card.More peace of mind than purchasing off FB marketplace but you pay slightly more for it.Setup was a breeze for my Cricket Wireless SIM Card.

I wasn’t the least bit disappointed with this purchase,"I bought this for my Wife for her birthday in January to replace her iPhone 7. Neither she or I are tech nerds and couldn’t care less about having the latest and greatest when it comes to phones. We both have used the iPhone platform for at least a decade, so naturally, we stick with it due to the familiarity with the operation and use of these Apple products.I was a little worried about when reading reviews as some people loved this product and others complained about scratches and imperfections. The one I received was flawless. I didn’t see a single scratch or blemish on it. The battery was dead when it arrived, but quickly fired up after being charged for a few minutes.The battery life seems fine, even though the battery life feature says that it had a max of 86%. My wife hasn’t had an issue at all with it draining in an inordinately fast manner and she used it a lot.She especially likes the privacy feature in which the screen isn’t visible to others from the side.Since she and I both aren’t keen on the facial recognition feature that replaced the Finger ID on this phone, she just uses the 6 digit passcode to unlock. It was slightly annoying at first, but not an issue considering that’s how it used to be in the “old” days of iPhones anyway.This phone does everything my wife wants it to do and arrived in absolutely pristine condition. The box is generic, there are no ear buds with it and the lightning cable and block are also generic. None of these make any difference to her since she has Bluetooth ear buds already and we have about a dozen blocks and cables already. The seller made it clear what would come with the phone, so we were already okay with that.All in all, this was a great value.

Great price for a refurbished phone,I bought this phone as a birthday gift for my dad. He had an iPhone 6 and the battery was on its last leg. He would literally make a few calls and it would die. He was going to get the battery replaced for $59. But I told his wife to asked him to wait so that I could surprise him with a newer one. Upon arrival I opened it and the phone is flawless like if it was never pre-owned by anyone. They did a great job refurbishing it! Once I gave it to him we switched his T-Mobile SIM card into it and went through the process of transferring everything from his old phone to the new one. Everything went smooth and in 10 min he was able to make and receive calls. All his apps also transferred which he loved!!!

Great phone. Choose your seller wisely!,"PLEASE NOTE: iPhone X 256GB was my purchase. I returned the first phone because I was not happy with the screen quality. I felt at arms length it had visible scratches on the screen I could see.I wasn’t after perfection but knew it could be better. I am leaving all 5 stars now because I returned the first and had a replacement that met my expectations in around 5-6 days (that’s me shipping back first phone and then them shipping another phone to me upon receiving my return).They also covered all fees associated with return process.No scratches at all on second phone. Basically flawless. I recommend picking your seller wisely. I searched and found hybrid IT and they did not disappoint throughout the whole process.If you pay attention to the ratings of the particular seller you are buying from, you can get a better idea for what you can expect.This phone is excellent and I am glad I chose the particular seller I went through on this refurbished phone.

FANTASTIC! Like new phone! 10/10!,"Like most folks, I was a bit scared of ordering a 'renewed' phone. As a matter of a fact, I have ordered some in the past, but none this expensive. Im not sure if I just got lucky or what, but my phone, on a scale of 1 to 100, was a 98! Near mint condition! only upon super close inspection did I find 2 tiny little scratches.. besides that, the phone was basically brand new. No evidence of a replaced screen with a cheap after market or anything like that. Battery holds 100%, functions and sound all 100%. Updated nicely and was fully 100% unlocked. Im very happy with this purchase! :)",2021年3月30日 在美国审核
"So far, So good","This unlocked iPhone X is a replacement for one that was returned because of poor battery health. This one, the replacement, has 100% battery capacity. I'm guessing the battery was replaced or the previous owner never used it. In any case, this iPhone X looks and works like new. I can't see any scratches or blemishes, and I looked close, very close. My SIM card for US Cellular works fine and no issues with connecting voice or data. The company that refurbished this phone sent out the replacement to me before I sent back the defective one., which is a plus for them. I waited a few weeks before writing this review to make sure it continued to work. So far no issues. If they are all like this I would buy from them again.UPDATE 4/25/22: It is still working like new. I added an Incipio case to protect it. I have been using it as a Hotspot for my laptop and works without issue any problems",2022年4月11日 在美国审核
Works perfectly fine.,"So I was very scared to but this phone because first of all I had never bought a phone on amazon and second well the phone was not brand new. Also this page did not have many reviews. But the information I read about the phone was everything I needed, plus they have free return in case it didn’t work out . So I bought the phone. Wow it looks and works like brand new. No scratches at all very nice and it works perfectly. I wanted the phone unlocked because I currently live in Mexico and yes it works just fine.

Do not be discouraged!,"Looking through the reviews, I was pretty hesitant to get the phone. I think with any phone that is bought used there is a great risk of issues. The phone itself came in great shape unlike some of the other reviewers claimed. There was a bit of an issue activating the phone due to whatever carrier might have had the phone before it was unlocked. Regardless, it just took a trip to the carrier store to get the phone switched over.As of now, the phone works great with little issues.

Nice buy in 2022,"Upgraded from my iPhone 7plus,this was a noticeable upgrade between that. Got used to no physical button and face recognition as well. The price was awesome for the 256gb version, I don’t like buying pricy phones but this one for the space it provides was well worth it for me.Camera isn’t as cinematic like the newer phones but it’s still good and can use for high quality photos and videos.I will say the screen did take some getting used to, my iPhone 7plus had a “bigger” screen going left to right, but the iPhone X has a much bigger screen top to bottom. It’s “skinnier” but longer, which shows more notes, webpages and and text top to bottom,but is smaller text in exchange left to right. I’ll definitely upgrade to a bigger phone with a bigger screen going forward, but this will do for now!",2022年3月7日 在美国审核

So far so good.,I took a gamble ordering this phone I wasn't feeling the negative reviews but the positive reviews outshine the negative. I was prepared when opening my package so I recorded myself doing so in case something went wrong during transit but it was in good condition and looks brand new. facial rec. doesn't always catch on the first try but oh well I gave 4 stars cause of that. battery was at 73 when I figured out how to check it idk what percentage it goes up or if it dies down as you use it usually it charges 100% with my other phones but I'm charging in hopes it charges to higher percentage. not too sure why they ask me to rate battery life. but 4 stars is good enough. id put 5 stars if it charged 100% obviously. overall its worth the money for me you have my approval. gang,2020年12月11日 在美国审核

Quality Product as Advertised from Amazon Refurbished,"This product (Apple iPhone X from MobileSpree) seems to deliver as promised from user reviews. Following additional user reviews from YouTube, the device appears to still be installed with an Apple Certified OLED screen and I was unable to observe any screen burn-in. I am a little disappointed that iOs software indicates Battery Health is at 84% Maximum Capacity, but this still meets the promise from Amazon Refurbished devices of being at least &gt;80%. I did not see any blemishes or scratches; thought the device had a polished screen, I noticed a little grime (probably oil residue from hands of previous owner) along the power and volume buttons.Overall, I am currently satisfied with device.

Really good for refurbished phones,I bought two of these phones one came with 100% battery life and the other one came with 95% battery. Everything on the phone looks new. Hardly no scratches at all. The one phone came almost dead and the other with a little less then half charged. And on the one phone it looks like there is a screen protector on it but it’s just the screen raised for what ever reason it’s not coming off it just looks like it has a thick glass screen on it.

The phone was too small for the box and I could shake it and hear the phone being tossed from side to side in the box. I wasn't too happy about that and was worried that the phone might be damaged.In the end the phone was perfectly fine, no scratches and it really looked brand new! I was so surprised and happy to find that the phone WAS unlocked as advertised and that the battery life was at 87% which is more than I expected.

Definitely a good buy -Highly recommend,"Wow ..I was really thinking this phone would show up and looking used .. but I was wrong!!It was in super great shape, no scratches or wear on it at all . The only sign of use was the very fine wear on the silver metal outside trim - which is covered by my new phone case anyways, right !!!!Silly me, I ordered the iPhone X, which is actually slightly smaller than the iPhone 8+, that I was upgrading from, but upon closer examination... I noticed that the screen is actually slightly longer than the iPhone 8 plus and just barely smaller screen when you consider the fact that it’s from edge to edge design and no longer has the action button in the middle.I really love the new feature of face recognition that saves me so much time and is very convenient at work knowing... apps just open so easy now &amp; knowingthat no one can steal my phone, or pick it up and get information that is vital personal information on credit cards and such. There are just too many new features to name them all but it is definitely an upgrade from an 8+!!!It did take me a few days to get used to the phone, &amp; how different this phone is overall, the Touch screen is just very different ...&amp; because I’m just not a very techy person...but I caught on really fast within three days I was in love with the phoneI would highly recommend buying from this seller, definitely worth saving the",2020年3月13日 在美国审核

Do not hesitate to update your old phone.,I bought this to replace my old Iphone 7. I was skeptical like everyone trying to buy a phone that you will put in your sim card.

The phone charges well and a full battery lasts the day. Both front and back cameras take great pics!Memory is what we expected and is much better then the 32gb on the old phone. These things really make a difference. The seller was great, reliable and honest. I got more than what I paid for and more then I expected!!

An upgrade at a fraction of the cost!,"I really like to buy Amazon renewed products when I have the opportunity.Not only have I saved a TON of money, but I like giving things a second life, but with the safety of being able to return it if it arrives broken or damaged.I have purchased iPads, my HP laptop, my smart sprinkler controller and other smart phones renewed and have yet to be let down.I was a little worried when this iPhone X arrived in some strange box that just said, ""smart phone"" and when I opened it up and saw that the cables were all generic.I was worried it was a fake, but it was the real thing.It wasn't quite as clean as I hoped it would be (physically) but it didn't have any real cosmetic damage, so I cleaned it up, popped in a T-Mobile SIM card, ran a software update and BOOM!We were off and running.It looks and works like a brand new iPhone X.I love that I was able to upgrade from my iPhone 8 without having to pay full price for a brand new device.If you're considering trying an Amazon renewed device, I can attest to them.So far I've had really good experiences.I took off a star because I expected it to come in original packaging and with OEM cables etc. and for it to be clean like new, but otherwise it was perfect.I sincerely hope this review was helpful for someone else!Feel free to ask any questions!",2021年8月12日 在美国审核

Battery Scam,"I’ll tell you what I’ve learned from this experience:1. Most likely, your battery will come at barely 80% or below. Mine came at 78% and “severely degraded” and I had to replace the battery at Apple - this adds $75 on the price you see.2. If the phone has ANY indication of a drop, send it back. Either the front or back panel was most likely replaced with non-Apple parts, so the phone will be garbage.Check your screen for “True Tone” color and if the hardware doesn’t fit in the casing.3. Gently remove the screen protector as soon as you receive the device. Refurbished suppliers use these to hide scratches, etc.4. Finally, search for the Phone’s identification number and make sure it’s not stolen.Generally, I think this is a hit or miss sleazy industry. I’m VERY disappointed in Amazon for sending out devices that are not to the specifications they list (especially battery life).Electronic Deals (the refurbishing company) was totally unresponsive.I had my device thoroughly checked at Apple, and felt like paying for the repair was less of a hassle than sending it back, even if this poor review isn’t worth the money I lost.",2021年3月13日 在美国审核

Do not waste your time...horrible experience all around,"I was hoping to get a new, unlocked, refurbished iPhone to surprise my boyfriend. The phone came, and was a little dinged up, but nothing too horrible. I also noticed that the battery life was already stated to be at ~85%, which is not what I consider refurbished (should be like new??). Nevertheless, I still gave it to him and he started the process of switching everything over to his new phone. He wasn't able to get his SIM card to recognize, so we had to go to the T-Mobile store. They told us at the store, after quickly looking up the phone serial number, that this phone is LOCKED and is registered as a lost or stolen phone. It is completely unusable to us, and we WASTED HOURS of our time. I am in the process of sending it back for a refund (as well as the accessories we bought separately which we now can't use). The seller, Chubbiestech, is completely unreachable when I call the phone number to try to get more information on ensuring a successful return. I have not been able to contact them and hopefully can get the information I need from Amazon.Overall this experience has been horrible and upsetting and a waste of time. I am extremely disappointed and embarrassed that I gave this as a gift, only to find out this unusable phone has likely been stolen from someone and sold to me.",2021年4月19日 在美国审核

Hit or miss purchase...,"Please read before buying: My phone has been holding up great after a month of using it. Only problem is my phone was made for the Japanese/Chinese market and my camera shutter sound won’t turn off. Other than that... Battery is great, face ID is amazing, but after reading a lot of the reviews I’d say that I wouldn’t recommend buying from this seller. They are difficult to contact and if you have any problems they seem to turn you away and blame the buyer. Yes, it’s a good deal considering this phone was originally sold at $1000, but i’ve read reviews that the phone was locked because of the difference in country, it was originally stolen or the phone plan hasn’t been entirely paid off. Also, their “refurbishments” aren’t really refurbishments. Again, I feel like I got extremely lucky with my phone. There’s only one problem that really isn’t that big of a problem. But please, if you really want a good quality phone for around this price, check with your carrier and see if they have some discounted phones or refurbished phones that are actually refurbished.

its whatever,"I'm reviewing this more as what you may expect from a renewed device.Mine was purchased through seller: Kiss Electronics IncThe phone is in decent condition, has the usual damage from being in a case all its life, doesn't show much damage which would come from being out of a case. It also came with a glass type screen protector as they do despite not being too scratched up.The screen, however, was cracked. I have attached a picture of where the crack is.Kinda cringe that I received a phone with a crack in the screen, but it is very minor and should not affect the usage. I'll choose to keep it despite this problem, because it's too much effort to send it back, and it will still fulfill it's intended use. No point in sending it to a landfill.Turning it on, it appeared to be set up or prepared with apple configurator, as it did not ask for any setup steps aside from wifi connection. This breaks apple's terms of use I'm pretty sure.It accepts a sim card fine so at this point I added it to my apple DEP and to my MDM, to which it did just fine (meaning it wasnt previously enrolled to anyone else's company).The phone is fully functional, no battery service messages, truetone works, no warnings, faceID is fine, nothing indicating the phone having had a third party repair. Came with 86% battery life left, I cant be bothered to test the capacity. Overall it functions perfectly as intended.I was feeling extra bored today so I decided to validate Amazon's promise on the device accessories that the cable is MFI certified and the charger brick is UL listed.It came with a sharkk branded charger and cable.The charger brick has a license and model number printed on it which come up as registered by Shenzhen DBK Electronics.I can not find any connection between sharkk and DBK.I did find just one of the other 13 model numbers on the UL cert to also be a sharkk product.For the cable, sharkk is not listed in Apple's MFI Authorized Manufacturers list.Shenzhen DBK is also not in Apple's MFI Authorized Manufacturers list.it was included a sim card removal tool which was actually really good quality. it is much flatter than the normal stamped steel ones and had a much higher quality finish.I bought this to issue out to an employee as a company phone.",2021年5月12日 在美国审核

"Camera shutter sound won't turn off, even when the phone is muted and all sound settings are off","The phone arrived right on time and in great condition. The charger that was included worked great.However, I think this phone must be from Korea or Japan, where it's apparently illegal to take digital photos without an audible shutter click. There is absolutely no way to turn off the sound, even when the phone is muted and the volume is turned all the way down. It happens in every major application that uses the camera.As an art student, I take TONS of pictures, and the camera is the primary reason why I got the iPhone X. I took it to multiple IT stores where they told me to either return the phone or to jailbreak it to rewrite the lines of code that affect the feature (and jailbreaking voids any warranty or service that Apple offers). I'm returning it because it's too big of a hiccup to work around (can't take pictures in a wedding/library/quiet setting at all...!).Ideally, they should make sure that the country of origin is taken into consideration before selling someone a product if it's going to be such a major feature difference.TLDR: nice phone, in great condition, good price, came on time, but this particular phone is unusable for anyone who likes to take pictures",2019年7月25日 在美国审核
IPhone X -This entire process is doable by anyone who uses a smartphone.,"This iPhone X was purchased to replace a vintage iPhone 6. Free shipping and delivery as promised. The package camebubble wrapped with no shipping or handling damage. This iPhone X looks like new. It was free of scratches, bumps or bruises. The only thing notable is that the battery only charges to 85%, even through it indicates 100%. It came with a screen protector, SIM card key and a charging cable, also.The Xhada 60% charge, so startup via theguided instructions was initiated. There was a bit of drama during the transfer of my backup from the old phone via bluetooth.I had to reboot the X and switch to iCloud to restore the backup via WiFi.Once I learned to do that, the data and APPS were on the new X in a few minutes.Next I removed the SIM from the 6 and installed it in the X. This entire process is doable by anyone who has used a smartphone.

"Nice Looking Phone - Battery Degraded/Used (Lying ""Functions Like New"" Ad Copy)","When you buy a phone that says ""renewed"" and advertised as looking and functioning ""like new"", you would expect the battery to be new or close to new.It's already degraded and only has 87% capacity.While this functionality will be (just) okay for a while, I'll be facing another $60 cost in the next few months.Why say renewed when, at best, maybe some glass was replaced or something.Renewed and functioning like ""new"" means that ALL of the functionality should be like new.The battery health is part of the functionality.The overall cosmetic condition is very good and I was only able to locate the smallest of blemishes anywhere on the phone.The screen is in excellent condition.I recommend on ANY phone purchase, you get a protective case.I ordered the Otter Box for mine.Considering the condition of what this phone is replacing, I am glad to have it but I am angry that the ad lied about how the phone ""..functions like new.""It should be made clear; especially since I chose a Prime listing with expectations that the condition would be accurate.",2021年10月18日 在美国审核

Honestly it’s kinda infuriating for me,"This phone is so suitable for what I needed in a phone—really long battery life, more security with Face ID, and a decent amount of storage. But one issue has plagued my phone: the touch screen. I’m not sure what it may be (an almost invisible imperfection on the screen or a hardware problem are probably the two most likely suspects), but my screen tends to glitch the hell out on me from time to time.Sometimes it’s when my phone is starting to warm up, sometimes it’s when I’m on low battery, and sometimes it’s at totally random times. The glitches mainly affect the very bottom of my screen, either making it impossible for me to swipe up to change apps or unlock my phone, or constantly wiggling around my whole screen without me touching it; additionally often clicking on things I never clicked on. It’s so infuriating that I’ve brought my rating down to a 2.Surely this isn’t an issue for anyone else, right? Because I’ve looked this up extensively and seemingly I’m one of very few people having this issue at all. Hell, not a single person who bought from this seller here on Amazon has had the same issue as me from what I’ve seen! I’m glad that there are some people out there who know this issue exists and they have solutions to them, but I can’t solve the issue I’m having with my own phone because of accessibility issues when it comes to certain tools or computer programs to fix the issue.Lesson of the day: don’t buy a used phone from Amazon. I was let down for the first time with my old 6s, and now I’ve been let down for the second (and last) time with my X. If you’re gonna get a used phone, just hope your friend or one of your family members is getting a new phone, or just buy a new phone if you’re getting impatient waiting for that lucky day of yours to come.",2020年1月14日 在美国审核

No help for dreaded ghost touch,"I ordered the phone and it worked well for a few months until it started the dreaded “ghost touch”. I took it to the apple store as they have a program to fix it for free as it is a known hardware issue. They would not fix it for less than $279 because there were third party parts. I contacted the seller (within the 90 days) to find out the next steps and they suggested a few rests to “fix” the problem. By the time I did the “fixes” and the ghost touch came back, I was told it was too late to return and now I am stuck with a phone that types and changes screen on its own. Needless to say I am unhappy with this customer service as it is clearly spa defect that is known and that I had nothing to do with and it is being held to some ridiculous warranty although it was brought to the attention of the seller before hand. I can’t help but feel like I have been duped. The cosmetic parts of the phone were great, it’s the hardware that is the issue.",2021年2月25日 在美国审核

iPhone X Rewound,"My Pixel 4 over heated and warped the cover so badly that it wouldn't close at all. So I decided to try iPhone again.

Their support basically consists of Web FAQs and some answers, but not everything. But this iPhone X is much easier to use and does a lot more than the old 7 did. I did purchase a clear plastic case for it which means I'm less likely to bust it by dropping it. I've had it about a week now, and have spent some time organizing the Apps into common groupings while also down loading a few apps I use regularly that are not on the iPhone 10 to begin with.

IT'S NOT FULLY UNLOCKED and WORST customer support,"As soon as the product arrived I tested it and see what went wrong, I am surprise but also disappointed in the same time. So here are my pros and cons about the item; Pros :What I love the most about it is the touch screen, I was very surprise how the touch screen works perfectly smooth, the battery life is great and the screen so crispy clear.Cons :Since the seller didn't provide the real picture of the item so It's very disappointing to find out that there are tiny scratches around the camera as you can see from the picture 2. It is not noticeable but it's not acceptable for me. Also it's not fully unlocked. Why ? Because I tested to make a phone call using my SIM card (Total wireless) it seems to work with LTE, however the internal speaker is very deep as in the other voice of the person I was talking to is very far although it's already on the highest volume.Then me and my husband tried to use his phone to call my number, but unfortunately it didn't work, so I thought maybe we have to be a little bit further, then he went outside while I'm inside calling using his phone.But again it didn't receive anything. As you can see on pic 1, it went to a voicemail meanwhile the iPhone didn't show anything. But I didn't take a pic of this iPhone received the voicemail notification on inbox.However I didn't try using speaker or headset so I have no clue about that.ALSO, the most annoying thing is that I tried to call their customer service andI spoke to one of them over the phone regarding my issue but she didn't bother to ask what would be the issue about the item etc instead she refused to help me create a shipping pick up label for UPS and persistently saying that they only provide UPS label for drop off. As I explained my situation that we do have stay home order but she only saying that I can request pick up service and other shipping services but it'll be in my cost, she was also mentioned that I can return the item when the stay home order is over, which I don't know when. Then again she refused to help me to create the shipping label for UPS pick up. In the end she hangs up the phone on my face. When I report it to the seller via message box the other customer service completely ignore my concern.Anyways, their refund will be issued 3 days after the item has arrived which after the inspected the whole thing with the item. I asked them about how long the item will be arrived they didn't even give me an estimate time.This is my first time experience but It's SO disappointing. PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM A 3rd PARTY SELLER.It's too much hustle in your part if you're hoping to get it done quickly. Hope this helps.",2020年7月16日 在美国审核
Beautiful iPhone X!,"Beautiful iPhone for $330. I traded it in with my carrier T-Mobile for a $830 credit towards the iPhone 12 Pro Max. They said the previous carrier was Sprint (not T-Mobile as advertised), but since Sprint &amp; T-Mobile have merged this was no big deal. The seller shipped it the same day, but because of one day of bad weather back East, UPS took OVER 2 weeks to deliver it to Los Angeles!

Saved so much money buying used.,"So with the first iPhone X I bought, the microphone didn’t work. So test all the features before you start making the phone your own. Lesson learned.

At times there are really minor glitches, like I won’t be able to press send after typing a text or I’ll have to say “hey Siri” really loud. But then it’ll work fine. It’s odd, but it doesn’t happen often enough to make me regret not spending $500 more on a phone I’ll just replace in a couple years anyway. Plus Amazon bought my old iPhone, so I got some money out of it anyway! Would recommend renewed for sure.",2021年6月17日 在美国审核

The Amazon renewed program is broken,"I ordered iPhones from two different suppliers with mixed results and returned both. Although I returned them because I ordered the ""all carriers version"" (A1865) and received the GSM-only version (A1901), my main issue was the variation in what ""new from arms length"" means. One phone I received was truly almost new looking. Just one small scratch on the screen and what looked like some pry marks inside the bezel, I'm guessing from replacing the glass, but the second phone I received was trashed, the back was scuffed, the bezel was badly scratched and all was easily visible from arms length. I don't know how anyone could interpret the second phone as being ""renewed"".<br>The other issue is with the battery life criteron. According to my research online, Apple recommends replacing the battery when it falls below 80% lifetime. That's when the problems begin to occur. For reference, my 5 year old iPhone 6s still has a remaining battery life of 94%, so 80% is pretty much done for and needs replacing. Both renewed phones I received, however, had battery life between 80-85%, which means they were almost needing to be replaced. So it is a ""renewed"" phone, but the battery will need to be replaced very soon. So I ask myself, if I'm paying $500 and screens and glass backs are being replaced, why shouldn't the battery be replaced as well? What would that cost, an additional $10? $500 seems like a lot of money for a phone with a bad battery (or close to it).my suggestions to Amazon with regards to their ""renewed"" program: please ensure that the sellers actually hold to your criteria, and also I would have the batteries replaced as part of the program. Otherwise you're just selling 100% used phones at 100% refurbished prices, and for me that's misrepresenting the product as well as charging about $100-$150 too much.</br>",2020年10月8日 在美国审核

IT WOULDN’T CHARGE. Took to to a tech shop the following day to get a wireless charger incase the port was an issue and that didn’t work. They tested it and told me that the battery life is degraded to the point where charging it cannot bring it back to life. I decided to contact the seller and ask for a partial refund so that I can fix the phone. I explained that I’m overseas and I can’t return it because it’s ridiculously expensive. I stated that I will keep the phone and I’m willing to pay to fix it but I need to be compensated since I have to fix what should be an already working device. I initially asked for a $60 refund because that’s what it’s cost me to replace the battery. Seller was adamant that they will give me a $30 refund or return the phone. He also went on further to say all personal information should be removed from the phone before returning or it will affect my refund. HOW ON EARTH DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO THIS WHEN THE PHONE WONT TURN ON?! .. Amazon is a whole different story… NOT HELPFUL! They both disgust me and I will never purchase electronics from Amazon again.

I was not able to get a replacement so I had to purchase another iphone, then return this one and am currently waiting for my refund.The second one I purchased had a perfect screen performance but I was not able to record any videos on any app including sending a video message. It always came out sounding staticy and barely audible.For this Amazon gave me a refund to purchase another one prior to sending back the old one.When I received the 3rd iphone, I was sure this one would be perfect but I was wrong. It has the exact same problem as the second phone at first but it appears to have cleared up. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 2.",2021年2月28日 在美国审核

Horribly Repaired product. Beware.....,"I ordered this iPhone for my wife. I got the product and the moment I took the phone in my hand, I could find the Siri button felt little different/loose than my existing iPhone X(which I purchased brand new a year back). Also noticed a major scratch on central frame which would have caused original display damage. Also I could totally see that the display was replaced and the sealing glue was oozing out from left upper side of display. Such kind of phone would not stand against water spills. It took me just 5 mins to figure out the product I was delivered was horribly repaired. I didn’t expect this from Amazon! Very very disappointed.",2019年6月20日 在美国审核
Bought 3 for my preteens,"Two out of the three were great. They had around 80% battery life, no scratches and worked great. The last one came with 50% battery life. It also has a glass screen protector where others didn’t. This last phone had some weird pixelated issues on one part. It wasn’t too bad. I decided to see if we could work through it. It just got worse. Phone would turn off randomly and would just keep resetting. The pixelation issue got worse. I tried to return, unfortunately I was just out of my return window because of health issues. I hoped I could get it fixed or a refund since I had bought so many of them. It’s been a month after they received and I haven’t gotten anything figured out with them yet. So 2/3 were good and still working but the last one well it’s caused a lot of tears and stress. So be wary. It is completely my fault for not returning it right away and trying to just deal with it. Not all the phones are equally good though.",2021年6月30日 在美国审核

Was good but Face ID stopped working. Returned phone.,"After about 30 days the Face ID quit working. Worked when we went to bed and was met with a “Face ID has been disabled” message upon waking up and unlocking phone. Restarted the phone and was stuck in a “boot loop” and eventual 4013 error when trying to restore to factory settings on a MacBook Pro. Finally was able to restore after an entire day on with apple care to no avail by restoring to factory on a windows laptop via iTunes. Face ID still didn’t work. Thankfully the 90 day amazon warranty was still in play which means I’ve had to repurchase the phone and return the first one which is obviously a hassle. Silver lining the phone is 40$ less now than a month prior but still irritating. Also, now for whatever reason the phone won’t play YouTube videos and another day with YouTube and apple reps haven’t provided any help of note. Hopefully the new refurb doesn’t have this issue when it arrives.But the phone did arrive looking awesome basically new no issues there with a screen protector pre installed and battery level showed like 90% upon receipt and first charge.

Perfect so far other than one irritating defect,"I'll start off by saying this phone is pretty decent for the price. Once I got everything set up and my SIM card from my previous iPhone in place, it worked really well. No scratches, audio is good, battery life is fine, and the storage capacity is amazing.However, the one major problem I have with this phone is that the charging port won't hold the part that plugs in. No it's not the charger it came with that is flawed, I have tried multiple chargers that are completely compatible and functioning, they just won't stay in. The only way I can get it to charge is if I jam the plug in and nudge it to the left. Doing that allows it to charge, but I can't hold it or use it easily without the charger slipping loose and falling out again. It's really annoying but not worth exchanging honestly, just something to expect or be wary of when buying a pre-owned phone, they're not going to be perfect. I may see if I can trouble shoot this issue myself or get it looked at if I'm really desperate, but since it at least has the capability to charge when it's sitting still and I'm not using it, it's something I can deal with.",2021年6月1日 在美国审核
Touch screen defective,"This phone screen gave me problems from the start. I put a thick screen protector on it and was told by a friend who is pretty savvy with cell phones that perhaps the screen protector was too thick and that’s why my touchscreen wasn’t responding like it should. It worked good enough most of the time but it seem to always give me some problems. Of course after the warranty was up the real problem started and if I would be out walking in 40° weather my screen would not respond at all. I tried putting on a new screen protector thinking that would help and saw that the edge of my screen was broken. I think this phone would’ve been OK for the long-haul if I would have used a more protective case, this phone never worked 100% like it should have , it was my first iPhone I learned a huge lesson.",2022年3月28日 在美国审核

This UNLOCKED phone was in fact LOCKED and the carrier was unable to activate it.,"I have never had an iPhoneX before. I'm sure it has great features and Apple lovers have little or no complaints. I gave the product a crummy rating because I ordered the unlocked version of this phone. I then went to my carrier (Verizon) and was shown right on the screen the field that said ""Carrier Locked"". Then I spent an hour with Amazon customer support on chat trying to get a refund. It's hard to get a refund when the chat person keeps asking if they can call you and you tell them, ""No, you can't because I have no phone."" I may be crazy, but once the return goes through and I am refunded for this phone (and the Zagg glass sheild I was dumb enough to apply BEFORE I went to Verizon), I will order another one of these, but I will just get the Verizon version. If that doesn't work, guess I'll worry about what to do next.Update:FYI, I went ahead and got the Verizon version. Worked out of the box once I installed the sim card.

I can’t complain enough!,"I Purchased Three iPhone X 256 gig phones from this seller. I was very skeptical about purchasing a renewed phone from Amazon. Upon unboxing my first phone I was super impressed! the phone looked practically brand new and there were very minor imperfections, not enough to make me disappointed in my purchase. However ,upon using the phone I realized that it was glitchy it would open and close apps by itself and it would often freeze . it was really just a very annoying phone .But I didn’t want to discount this company so I texted the Customer Service per the instructions on their page ,there was no response. I literally texted them over 100 times and no one ever responded. when I reached out to them through the Amazon app they did respond quickly with auniform answer that didn’t actually answer the question I asked. However , I ordered another phone ,transferred my information and return the original phone. because the phone was defective, I was fully refunded (note: there are various restocking fees for this seller) the second phone I Purchased ,was also defective. The phone itself had much more damage than the first and the screen came with a few scratches , not a deal breaker. My big issue is the phone is a few millimeters larger than a normal iPhone.it doesn’t properly fit in an iPhone case. I don’t know why it’s mishaped.the functionality of the phone is OK , so far it works fine I have yet to have any trouble with it.the shape of it causes problems because in order to use the side buttons , I have to take my phone case off and put it back on constantly. for the price I paid for this phone ,I don’t feel likeI should have to deal with that hassle ! I’m not sure if I’m going to purchase a third phone from this company. Maybe the third times the charm?other refurbished phone seller on Amazon havethe same kind of mixed reviews... so IDK . I’ll update my review if I decide to order from this seller again. My current phone is definitely going back.UPDATE: The third time was not the charm! I Purchased a third phone, thesize is OK.

No!!! Stuck with a phone that doesn’t work!!!,"My VERY first negative review. The phone received has pixel issues &amp; turns off without warning! No way that this could have passed a quality control inspection.

Your return will be processed when we receive it. Have a good day!” - their response. You must return your non working phone (that was supposed to be renewed) AND essentially be without a phone until they send you a replacement. This phone will be returned for REFUND &amp; I was forced to purchase from another seller. NEVER again. ALSO they charge YOU to ship/return your faulty device, even though Amazon policy reads “ You will need to return your item at no charge to you. If we do not receive your return after we issue you a refund or a replacement, we may charge you the original amount you paid for the item.“ They never said “we are sorry for the inconvenience” OR offered any customer service.

Screen Durability,"My daughter had dropped my phone from not even a 1 ft. fall and the screen itself popped off of the actual phone! The screen continued to work without being entirely on the phone, and hanging by a wire. I had tried to simply pop the screen back on but then the whole thing turned black and I wasn't able to see anything but I was still able to fell vibrating from notifications. I went to get it fixed the day after and come to find out the screen that was on there wasn't even the original screen, and on top of that the person who did put the last screen on put it on wrong resulting in the screen coming off. In my opinion, the fact that the screen WASN'T the original, it should've been stated in the description. And I also wasn't able to use my iCloud due to ""not enough storage"". But my other phone was only a 16GB and I still had space to give. Other than that everything else works fine.",2021年3月18日 在美国审核

Unexpected Touchscreen Issues,"While the iPhone X provides numerous features that are improvements over the previous models, it exhibits some problems with touchscreen functioning while the battery is charging. This results in one of two undesired behaviors:<br>1) Portions of the screen not responding to touch. This is usually in the upper corners.2) Greatly delayed response to touch such that the screen does not appear to respond at all followed by periods where the screen seems to be under the control of some outside force because multiple actions take place in rapid succession that completely ignore any actual touch commands being made in the moment.Best response is achieved by limiting interaction while the phone is charging.</br>",2022年1月20日 在美国审核

I tried all the normal ways to shut off the sound, and with research found that the only was to disable this feature would be to jailbreak the iPhone -- which I didn't want to do! Ultimately the feature proved to be too annoying, so I'll be returning and hopefully receiving a different model.",2020年3月28日 在美国审核

The display died!,"On September 9, 2020 I purchased an Apple iPhone X 64 GB factory unlocked smartphone. The price for this unit was $429.99. I was able to transfer the contents of my iPhone 6 to the iPhone X. The iPhone X worked for approximately a week, and then I went into a black screen mode. I Googled repairs and then contacted the Apple site to see about making the black screen go away. Nothing worked! I finally took the phone to my Apple Store in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester New Hampshire and the technician took the phone into the back room. The technician came back and informed me that the phone worked but the display did not. The display was aftermarket, not an Apple product. But for an additional $270+ I could have an Apple display installed. No thank you!!! I’ll return the phone to Amazon. The Apple technician stripped the iPhone X of all information and returned it to its original new in the box state.What I’m looking for now is a return authorization for the phone and a refund of the $429.99 to my credit card.

WORST PHONE EVER,"Okay but has some issues. It causes videos to upload very pixilated, my App Store wouldn’t work for a month, my keyboard lags, camera quality isn’t that great. Overall pretty dissatisfied. Wouldn’t buy again *update about 8 months later. : I feel like I wasted a lot of money on this phone because now I need to buy a new one. My last phone (iphone8+) worked great and lasted several years. This is a newer model and it is literally the worst. It lags ALL THE TIME. It over heats, it freezes, and shuts down. Nothing runs smoothly. Let’s not forget FACETIME DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE. I always face time my friends no problem, then all of a sudden when I switched to this phone FaceTime never connects. It will ring end ring and that is it. I honestly hate this phone. This is NOT an Apple iPhone, it’s a cheap fake knockoff phone posing as Apple. Yeah sure I have ios but I don’t believe for one second this phone is of Apple quality. Easily the worst money I’ve ever spent. Save your money, buy somewhere else.",2020年10月22日 在美国审核

Little disappointed.,"I am struggling a little bit here and and realizing the iPhone X is not new, it has been certified for use with no issues.When reading the description, the seller stated the battery life is at least at 80% which the one that was sent to me was not.Also, the screen jumps around on its own.I have to turn off or restart the phone several times in the one week I have had the phone thus far.I will also mention the top part of the screen does not always work.Again, I have googled for fixes and nothing seems to work.Will probably exercise 90 day warranty and send it back =(",2021年6月30日 在美国审核
RIP off.,"I got this thinking it would be just like in the description..there is nothing that infuriates me more than receiving a product like a phone that has some generic battery from China that heats up within 2 minutes of opening an app that really upsets me. I contacted the seller and they said I could send it back, well I dont have time for that , stuck done here in quarantine without another phone and things to take care of I am stuck with this cheap crappy phone.

Pretty good for used phone,"The iphone 10 came with all the stuff it said it would come with. (charger.) Battery life was good. Charges well. Pretty good phone. The only problem was when I spoke on the phone. I could barely hear the caller but the caller could hear me. I had to always put the phone on speaker to hear the person calling. Which isn't too bad, but if your in an open area, it can kinda be annoying. But its not too bad because its advised for people not to put phones very close to ears anyways because of radiation.But overall good phone.",2021年2月24日 在美国审核

Yesterday the phone locked up for 12 hours. I could not make or accept calls or even turn the phone off. I have replaced the SIM card, done several factory resets, and had both ATT and Apple run diagnostics. Apple suggested that it is probably a bad board. SO, beware.

Some sounds when watching videos would be muffled to inaudible. Then, a few months pass by and the Face ID is no longer functioning. I give it a few more months before the whole things falling apart. My intuition tells me this phone had previous water damage, a part or two were repaired and then sold on Amazon. There should be some type of quality control that goes into selling refurbished electronics because it is quite clear none has gone into this one.",2022年1月8日 在美国审核

Screen damage was covered by a protector!,"Purchased the phone back in March! Was very happy with how it appeared as a refurbished phone. Even came with a screen protector already on it which I was impressed by, but should have actually checked why.I just had to replace the screen protector this week... discovered that the phone had some pretty bad scratches and buff marks in the glass. And when I wiped the screen to put the new protector on I discovered that they had put a very thin polish on some of the scuffs on the end of the screen, which came off with the cleaning wipe. I did not expect the phone to be perfect, due to it being refurbished. But I was disappointed that it was not previously noted in the description that the screen would be more damaged that typical.This is my 4th refurbished phone and my screen has never been this bad. The screen protector does hide it very well. But still frustrating none the less. So if you get a phone with a protector I recommend removing it and checking the screens quality.",2020年7月25日 在美国审核

Apple support confirmed the problem and I was told to take it to a certified technician, who quoted me $150 USD because the warranty was expired.

Eventually turned on only for none of the buttons and the top half of the screen doesn't work. Water got in because the water resistant seal was previously broken.

Not an unlocked phone! Beware,"Really disappointed with this seller and the phone. Don’t waste your time or money! To begin, when we received the phone and tried to connect it to a carrier we were told the phone is locked. Informed the seller and they insisted it was unlocked. Attempted to connect to another carrier and again told it was locked. Contacted the seller a second time and instead of fixing it they tried to give me steps to do the job myself, as annoyed as I was having to do it myself, it still didn’t work. After many messages, the phone still was not unlocked!!! Finally we decided to return it and it’s been delivered for a week now and still NO REFUND has been issued!!!Throughly disappointed!

Some issues...,"My updated review: (2 stars): Had some issues with the phone. Battery life quickly plummeted to 80% and noticeably discharged faster. Camera lens seems unstable and rattles sometimes taking blurry pictures and video. I tried to submit a warranty request for their 90 day warranty but they wanted me to return the phone and be without one for more than a week and go through another 10hrs of wiping data and reloading data/signing in and setting up apps. I was also out of the country and couldn’t do that. Anyway they still get one extra star for providing decent service and having an ok product. After I fix these things though could have just bought a new one. So think about that first. You might get lucky. You might notMy initial review (3 stars): Generally this phone is in pretty good shape.Battery life is at 89%, the case is nice, and the photo lens is clear.But there is a noticeable scratch in the display that is visible at greater than 12in distance.

"This was a Verizon phone, not AT&amp;T.","We bought this phone because of the thousands of great reviews, and were really bummed to find that while the phone worked it was not unlocked for AT&amp;T. We even took it to both the AT&amp;T and Apple stores to try and work with it and get it working, but both said that the phone was not on the right network to be able to work and be unlocked for AT&amp;T. When the Apple store looked at the settings they said it was only unlocked for Verizon and had appeared at an Apple store two months prior for the same issue and had been returned to Amazon. So this phone has been sold twice and wasn't able to work for the buyer for how it was advertised. It was super frustrating, so we just went ahead and bought a good phone from the Apple store, which we just have done from the start. I'm sure it would have been lovely if we got what was advertised, but we didn't.",2021年4月8日 在美国审核

Don not buy!!,I purchased a “renewed” iPhone X. The phone does not charge to its fullest capacity. The phone gets hot when it’s on too long. And my biggest issue is that the apps from previous owner is burned onto the screen. I was finally able to get a quote from the Apple Store to fix the issue which would cost about $125-$175.I contacted the seller and they offered me $20 and I would have to pay for the rest of the repair. My other option was to exchange for another phone.After all the back and forth now I would have to wait a week or so for a replacement from a company who mailed me a damaged phone to begin with? Or $20 to put towards the repair of a phone I just bought? This seller has poor customer service and a lack of internal communication.

All three Best Buy’s I went to yesterday didn’t have everything to replace it, and I have 3 appointments at different apple stores today. It’s out of warrant and on-apple care edgings, so I’m gonna end up pocketing $69 dollars in addition to the 340 or so spent so far.

Over the course of the next 2 days, with a call to apple support to determine that there were no software or hardware issues, 2 calls to AT&amp;T, and 3 trips to the AT&amp;T store, the phone was determined to be blacklisted and reported as stolen by the original owner.

Aside from this dead zone the phone would also register a bunch of false input and do all sorts of crazy things without me even touching the screen.CellCow claims to have a 30-point inspection before sending these out but that is obviously not the case.

"Horrible phone, faulty technology","The farcical recognition barely worked, the battery life was absolute crap. Originally the first phone I received was locked for AT&amp;T when I bought a FULLY UNLOCKED phone. I only had the first one for a couple days before Sprint told me that it was AT&amp;T locked. So then I had to exchange it for what I actually paid for. Then the second device I received only lasted a month before I started having problems and then I noticed the battery life was horrible and the facial recognition was barely functional. I barely even used the device, but I had to constantly have it plugged in if it was just going it be sitting there not being used or it would die so fast and even faster if I even used the device. Now I find out the logistics board is complete crap and the device won’t even turn on at all. I also found out that I bought the phone with the a crappy logistics board to begin with. So now I have to either spend 800+ and buy a completely new phone or 700+ for a new logistics board. Definitely telling my friends to avoid this company completely. I was given a faulty device, that wasn’t at all worth the money I paid for it. I wish it was possible to give zero stars. STAY AWAY, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY.",2021年5月12日 在美国审核

And when I did make an effort early on to return it they were very unclear and broad about their instructions. Also the calling line did not even work.

Seller switched out original battery for cheap aftermarket one with less than 80% health.,Noticed my battery was dropping in health fast so took the phone to the apple store: they confirmed the battery was RECENTLY (within 3 weeks) switched and replaced with a very cheap and unreliable aftermarket battery that will eventually be completely shot within the next couple months (conveniently when the warrant and return policy would end). Seller probably keeps and resells the good batteries and sends us the cheap aftermarket ones. Makes me wonder what other cheap parts they switched out on us.

I would love to be able to review it properly if received withoutcracked screens so my first impression was not very good. Definitely not worth the money spent.,2019年12月12日 在美国审核
The touch screen is just not right,Ever since I got the phone I've been experiencing a few malfunctions with the screen but it got to the point where half of it wouldn't work. I need to lock and unlock the phone constantly to make it work properly and sometimes that wouldn't even do.Considering the money I have to spend on fixing it I can tell that this was not the worthiest purchase.,2020年4月7日 在美国审核
Bad refurbished iPhone!,"I purchased this iPhone for my moms bday. She transferred to this iPhone &amp; within 2 days the phone now only rings once &amp; has a blue hue on the screen. I contacted the company for a new iPhone, they said that I wld have to purchase another on for $360, then return the broken one for a refund. So it’s either I am forced to purchase another iPhone, or leave my mother without a phone for at least a week to do the return &amp; get another phone. This company’s policies definitely aren’t favorable to the consumer!",2021年10月11日 在美国审核
Bad Phone!!,This sucks. Got the phone for my wife and it has “ghost touches” which pretty much means that the screen recognizes touches that aren’t actually happening and makes the phone go crazy to where it is unusable. This started happening pretty much right after we got the phone and is only getting worse! Just save the money and go buy from an Apple store.,2021年1月6日 在美国审核

Large screen but fits in a pocket.,Had two weeks to return it. My original intent was to have a big screen with a phone small enough for my pocket. I read all the negative reviews. It took a few days to learn buttonless mauvering...but I learned it. Facial ID perfect. But for day to day use with no fear of back glass breaking I decided to swap the X for the 7.But at the last moment I decided to keep the ten. It does have the largest screen yet fits in my pocket.,2018年9月11日 在美国审核
One of the greatest iPhones ever made,"This is an amazing iPhone. Call it iPhone ex, Cross, Marks the Spot, Ten, who cares? Having it four years now without any problems is a testament of time. The newer iPhones are slightly nicer looking and take marginally better photos and videos. However, this is typical of Apple. Very incremental with high prices. I do realize that the best thing about iPhone is how much better and stable the battery life is, along with known and proprietary iOS--outstanding at worst. Even with the latest iOS updates, the iPhone X is so fast it is even faster than the new 2021 iPad Pro. (I should not delve into serious design issues just the other day.) The A12 processor is just blazing fast. The performance of iOS 14.7 is just as good as the performance that of iOS 11 back in the day. The camera did not exactly take the greatest video and photo quality at first, but iOS 12 the algorithms improved a bit. There is only one minor issue I have lately, and it may be a setting or carrier issue, but sometimes the cellular data does not load Internet browser web pages when not connected to WiFi. I noticed that VPN is enabled when using cellular instead of WiFI, which this feature can be disabled, but then immediately enabled again until WiFi network has been connected back to, where using cellular data stops. In other words, turning off cellular and using WiFI only causes errors loading web pages, even YouTube videos sometimes. It may be an automatic security feature (cellular hackers exist, maybe, but is that much harder due to encryption?). Having 256 GB of storage for a phone back in 2017 still works out well today. I might consider iPhone 13 next year, but hoping that 8K and 16 MP camera can be a thing then. Make sure you have a good case and screen protector for iPhone, or any smartphone. iPhone is less fragile than iPad, for instance, as they are smaller, and may be made of more expensive materials that are more durable, but the small form factor keeps the MSRP in check. Almost no complaints on the iPhone X. It is still, in my eye, mostly current technology. Not much has been improved upon. The speakers are amazing, perhaps an engineering feat--the newer and larger iPhone 12 Pro sounds slightly tinny and less bass, but soprano voices sound a bit 'off' on iPhone X. (I am an audiophile, or the average person may not distinguish such nuances.) Five stars. Definitely a must-have, if you can still buy one, and if you already have one, upgrading might not be needed. It depends on your needs and preferences aside from what is 'affordable.' Great screen, very good battery life (maybe drains a little more than it used to but not by much), excellent sound quality, and more reliable than some people being skeptics at launch. The notch is rather cool, I actually like it. A neat design feature. Little details like watching movies in full screen, the clock and cellular/WiFi status moves into the notch areas so nothing is obstructed. That cannot be easy to do both technically from hardware and software coordination. The headphone jack is history as of this model, which is OK, because headphones are bad for your hearing, and sometimes do not fit your ear. Sometimes I forget that headphones are still relevant since my younger days. I do not use face recognition, but what I have read, it works very well. X = Excellent. A+ product, Apple!",2021年7月29日 在美国审核

"Phone Lasted 130 Days, Refurbished Phone Warranty Is 90 Days","I bought a refurbished iPhone that I received on June 24, 2018. On November 3, 2018, while using the phone, I could feel the phone getting way too hot (for no reason), and then it shut itself down. I got it restarted about 30 minutes later, and then it immediately overheated again and completely died. My refurbished iPhone lasted exactly 130 days.<br>I, of course, contacted the seller but they refused to help me or stand behind what they sold me. They basically said “too bad, so sad” the warranty is 90 days. So, no, I do not recommend buying a refurbished iPhone, and I especially don’t recommend buying one from this third-party seller (Prime Mobility).</br>",2018年11月20日 在美国审核
IPhone X is complete BULLCRAP!,"STAY AWAY From APPLE products! When Apple’s Marketing Chief Phil Schiller gave his blessing to the iPhone X, ""So if you happen to be hanging by the pool, drop your phone in the water... don't worry, dive down, grab it, rinse it, let it dry, you'll be fine.”You would *Think* Apple would stand by its product.WRONG! As it happened to me, I stopped my phone in shallow water, only 3 feet deep, for a few seconds, and IMMEDIATELY my phone bricked. I purchased my iPhone X for $1199 and I would expect my phone would last a few years and have the peace of mind that my phone would still work after that incident. Well I was more than angry when Apple would not even attempt to replace my product, but charges me $549 to replace with a $#%$ refurbished product. The Staff at genius bar were snobby and would not even care!You work hard for you money, you spend your hard earn dollars for a good quality product, but APPLE is only scamming you and stealing from you!THINK ABOUT IT!

"If Buying Amazon ""Renewed,"" make sure it's ""Renewed Premium""!","I learned the hard way on this purchase. I bought the Iphone X through Amazon Renewed store in December 2020. There IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH IPHONE X (&amp; later) TOUCHSCREENS going bezerk, all the apps opening and closing, links opening, randomly dialing people, etc. The only way to get it to stop temporarily is to turn the phone off and back on. This is known as ""ghost touch"" and is a manufacturing defect. Because of this defect, Apple ""graciously"" extended the warranty on their defective yet crazy expensive product for 3 years FROM THE INITIAL RETAIL SELL DATE. This is NOT the date YOU buy it refurbished. This is the date the brand new item was sold to its first owner, which on an iPhone X is apparently sometime in 2018. If the 3 year warranty is expired, APPLE WILL NOT FIX YOUR EXPENSIVE PHONE OF THEIR KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT AT THEIR EXPENSE. You will get to pay for that yourself. After paying hundreds of dollars for a fancy phone, expect to pay about $300 to replace the screen through an authorized Apple repair facility, or up to $200 through other cellphone repair clinics.Currently, this Iphone X is the most expensive paperweight I've ever had. Very dissatisfied with Apple on this. They need to do better.",2021年6月10日 在美国审核

This one won't properly detect my sim card, which I know is an issue with the phone because the one I was using previously did not have an issue along with the one that had been returned.

Screen has micro scratches,Advertised as refurbished.Screen has many micro scratches - can’t see them when it is On.But when off / dark screen you can see them.One is a blemish that causes the phone screen to click itself.It clicks itself often.Took into Apple dealer (not Apple) because there is a screen chip problem with the X also.However they ran the diagnostic 2x and said nope it’s fine — but look closely when it’s off.These abrasions are triggering.,2021年11月3日 在美国审核

It feels like they bought a fair condition iPhone off of eBay and resold it for up to 100$ more than they paid for them. Everything is working though.

I don't think these folks are ""renewing"" anything. It came looking dirty as crap, caked up funk around the camera from being in a case for so long and never cleaned. I was able to clean it myself but it was never refurbished or renewed by anyone. Just adjectives these companies use to sell the higher grades of used phones. Anyway, I still prefer amazon's pre-owned over anywhere else. Like I said out of a dozen phones only one had to go back,and it wasn't bc of cosmetic issue,it was software.

"As advertised, functions well- except one issue","In the aspect of this being an Apple phone, it functions well, and in general there is no huge issues.BUT at first it wouldn't work on any apps and I finally took it to my Verizon store just to have them tell me that ""for whatever reason Iphones aren't playing well with VPN's""so I won't be able to use my VPN until I go to an Apple store and they can do some sort of patch (fix) that will make it okay.Frustrating!I routinely use my phone for business and need the VPN so I resorted to using my old iphone 6 for as long as that worked and now mysteriously it isn't accepting the VPN anymore either. UGH!Technology is well and good but these power plays by big companies seeking to live off our digital fingerprint (and the info from it they can sell/use) gets old, and is really to the point of being flagrant.From the refurb aspect, it was good too, well packaged and came with all expected items.For the money involved it would be nice if the hardware it came with was brand, instead of off brand.",2021年6月2日 在美国审核

Great phone! Would buy again!,"Fantastic phone! Don’t be freaked out if when you go to your settings where it says network and it says “phone not allowed”.I got this phone as a replacement for my iPhone 8 and the battery was so bad it couldn’t be off of the charger for even 60 seconds without shutting down. I ordered it before Christmas so I had a long wait so when I finally got it I was so excited but when I went to the network settings it said “phone not allowed”. So then I go when I look it up online and it says some thing about how that typically can me and the phone was blacklisted because it was stolen which really freaked me out. But then I found another article online that said this also can happen if a phone is wiped or refurbished.

But if I had just believe that first article I wouldn’t have even bothered calling my wireless carrier. So if you end up having this problem don’t be alarmed I would absolutely buy a phone from this company again it was in perfect physical condition not one scratch or blemish anywhere which is something I was was worried about with buying a renewed phone.The only thing that I would warn against is if you do end up purchasing a phone and you get it and it is not up to your satisfaction you will not get any sort of a refund until the company that you purchased the phone from receives your phone and then from there it could be up to 10 days before you get said refund so when it comes to buying a refurbished phone keep that in mind.",2021年1月13日 在美国审核

Really great experience!,"Really great experience! I was completely sold by the storage space and sale price.

Set-up was a total breeze, and the easiest I’ve ever had to set-up a phone, so the value in that alone is huge. Everything got transferred over — settings, apps, data within the apps, etc. It came with a screen protector already applied, a generic charging cord + plug, and no headphones — but I already had chargers, and headphones from my previous phone.

esteticamente excelente pero ...,"Quiero comenzar diciendo, que esta resea es casi 1 mes despues de mi compra, y esto es lo que he obervado:PUNTOS POSITIVOS: esteticamente llego impecable, sin ningun rayón, funciona el faceid (solo que a veces es dificil que te reconozca), cargador y cable funcionan bien, el precio, en teoría le hacen un check up de 20 puntos de inspección, aunque ya me hizo dudar porque la batería no esta al 90% al menos.PUNTOS EN CONTRA: la batería llego al 89% (en la tarjetita dice que lo minimo que lo entregan es con 90%) por lo cual me dura menos de las 4 hrs de pantalla, ya se me apago una vez de la nada al estar utilizando la camara (esto si me hace sospechar de algun problema posterior, tendre que seguir monitoreandolo), y la seal del telefono es muy pobre, no se si esto sea un problema o asi sea con todos los Iphone X.Las camaras si estan muy justitas a comparación de los Iphone actuales (mod 12).Dejo esta resea como testigo del estado del telefono, esperando que en un futuro siga funcionando bien, sino tendré que apegarme a la garantía.",2021年3月25日 在墨西哥审核

Highly recommended,"I was very hesitant to buy a renewed iphone, especially off Amazon. But I was completely shocked and amazed on how extremely clean and brand new this iphone looked. There was absolutely no scratchs, no marks, no dust particles visible anywhere on the iPhone and no signs of usage. Apps and cameras work completely brand new. My iPhone 6s was giving me alot of problems such as randomly logging out of apps, randomly going to a black loading screen, not being able to answer phone calls and constantly having to restart the phone. So far with the iPhone x, there is no such problems I had with the iPhone 6s. I highly recommend.",2021年7月19日 在加拿大审核
