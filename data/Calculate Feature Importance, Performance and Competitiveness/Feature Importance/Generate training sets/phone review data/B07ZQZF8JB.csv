"Great value, fast shipping, perfect buy.","From reading other reviews I was a bit hesitant. Comparing the S10 vs the S10+ I wasn't crazy about the larger size but upgrading from an older S8 it's not that much bigger. The larger battery did sound like a huge plus considering I had to charge my phone several times a day as a heavy user. A week into using the phone as usual at the end of the day the battery is near 40%. It's amazing as a heavy user to not have to charge the phone in the middle of the day.Pros: Price. Refurbished phone, I would never know it wasn't new except for the packaging. It did come with a fast charger and the sim card pin. No headphones. Battery life is AMAZING. Camera is solid. Bluetooth works great with all my devices, headphones, car, speakers etc. Wifi is solid. Cell coverage is good. Call quality is great.Cons: None so far. If I'm being hypercritical the packaging could have been a bit more protected and the sim pin could have been in a bag and not loose in the box and included factory headphones. BUT for the price I can buy headphones, I already have bluetooth headphones I use daily.Bottom line, phone looks new, works great. No complaints. I'm on AT&amp;T and had zero issues transferring to the new device.",2019年10月3日 在美国审核
Stolen goods!,"Phone is great. However, when I tried to add it to my sprint account,I was getting a message that said it was locked.I brought it to the Sprint store and they verify that they could not have it because it was assigned to another network. After a bit of research I discovered it was assigned AT&amp;T. It was then discovered that the phone was still their property as it was not paid off. Essentially what I bought was stolen from AT&amp;T not paid off and sold to another customer. Do not buy from this seller",2019年7月5日 在美国审核
Brick that takes lovely pictures,"I really wanted to be among the lucky ones who didn't have a problem with their phones but unfortunately that wasn't in the cards for me. I essentially received an S10+ brick that takes lovely pictures and videos. The colors really pop on the screen and the images don’t appear overly filtered. The slow mo feature is fantastic!I received it on a Friday and was pleasantly surprised to see it had no scratches or signs of previous use. Transferring data, apps, contacts etc from my old Galaxy S7 edge was a breeze thanks to smart switch. I tested everything and it all seemed to be working. Due to wifi calling, I didn't realize the phone wasn't connecting properly to my T-Mobile LTE network. It wasn't until during the weekend that I tried calling or texting away from home that it became apparent.An hour on the phone with T-Mobile customer service followed by 3 or 4 visits to the store failed to resolve it. What's weird is at the store it was working but as soon as I walked out the door, it would stop. It was connecting to an H network instead of LTE, but only in the T-Mobile store. This even baffled the associates.I have returned it and will consider replacing it with another S10+, and shall update my review at that time.************ UPDATE *************On November 20 I placed an order for a replacement with the seller 2019BestSale. Delivery was due on Nov 29 - Dec 2. When it didn’t arrive I emailed the seller and his response was to contact Amazon warehouse. He also stated he didn’t have my address in the system. This is weird because I have purchased a few hundred items over the years and not once has there been an address issue. I emailed him my address and a new date was set of Dec 9-12. That date came and went and still no phone. I contacted him again and his response again was to contact Amazon. A new date has been set of Dec 20 - 23. That's a full month from the order date! I went ahead and canceled it.My advice, STAY AWAY FROM 2019BESTSALE!!! He takes orders that he is either unwilling or unable to fulfill. He doesn’t set a specific delivery date. It is always a 3 day window and even then, he cannot produce the goods! Unfortunately this seller appears to be one of a few that offers the blue color that I want so I’ll just have to settle for black from a more reputable business.",2019年11月19日 在美国审核

"Friendship ended with Apple, now Samsung is my best friend.","I was an Apple user for since the iphone 5 and like most Apple users was heavily invested in their ecosystem.I ended up not being able to use my iphone and did not want to settle for a cheaper iphone due to financial constraints.Due to this I ended up looking elsewhere and really liked the idea that I could get a like new S10+ for half the cost of new so I took the plunge and I'm glad I did.I never was a big fan of android but Samsung's One UI is very user friendly and has almost 0 bugs compared to most Android offerings.The OLED displays that Samsung produces are next level, even when compared directly to the new iphone 11 Pro.It's so crisp and vibrant!Battery life is phenomenal as well.The company I went through, used-gadget, sent me a pristine S10+ that looked as though it had never even been used.Will certainly be sticking with Samsung for the near future and will also be buying refurbished from Amazon again.",2019年10月1日 在美国审核

Best Purchase EVER. I'd definitely buy again.,"The thought of getting a refurbished or ""renewed"" phone is always so nerve-wracking but with BuySpry, it didn't have to be! I purchased this phone on Sep 23rd, 2019 and had it arrive Sep 25th, 2019. Thank you Amazon Prime!<br>Disclaimer: I received NO compensation for this review. I decided to write this due to the lack of accurate or honest reviews in this section.If you'd like to check the status of your phone to make sure it isn't being financed, or stolen feel free to check out imei.info, dial *#06# and input the numbers that come up into the website. You'll get a detailed review on your phone! Mine came out clean thankfully!About the phone:This phone is indeed an international model, so don't expect to get Snapdragon. You'll be getting the international version, Exynos. Is it a significant difference? No, not at all. My phone did not come with any preinstalled bloatware which is amazing. It saved me a lot of uninstalling.Condition of the phone:You can clearly see from my photos that it is in pristine condition. I set a drawn wallpaper that I created to set out the color vibrancy and I love it! The screen has no scratches what so ever, though I'm not surprised due to the fact that this is gorilla glass we're dealing with here. The back of the case proved to be just as worthy of its pristine title as there were no scratches to be found, even under a magnifying glass!What's inside:BuySpry really takes the cake with their products. This product came in a generic box, bubble wrapped and upon powering it on it was partially charged, as it should be. It also came with a generic type-C cable and fast charging block. Included was also a SIM card pin for easy removal. BuySpry also included instructions on how to connect your phone and what to do if you find yourself having trouble.My Carrier:I'm on Metro by T-mobile and I had no problems at all. I called them up, followed their instructions as I inserted my SIM card. Once I was advised to power down the phone and turned it back on I can say that in less than a minute I was on my network with 100 percent flawless connectivity.Notes:I was extremely skeptical about buying this phone but BuySpry made me confident with the condition that I received my phone. I'm a working woman, constantly on the go and I rely on my phone for all of my business transactions and needs. The phone is flawless! The only thing that sets it apart from not having bought it from a flagship store is that it doesn't come with any of the goodies I would have gotten. Does it matter? Not at all. With the amount I saved buying from them leaves me with more than enough to buy those items on my own!Before leaving a review, please make sure that you contact the seller before writing a review. Negative reviews reflect badly upon the seller. I had messaged BuySpry with some questions as the phone was on its way and I was answered almost immediately. I would definitely buy from them again!!Thank you, BuySpry!</br>",2019年9月26日 在美国审核
Looks and works like a BRAND NEW phone for 1/2 the price,"It is indeed re-new-ed!!I cannot find a single scratch on the phone.Its literally BRAND NEW looking.We spent all evening yesterday taking and watching pictures on a holiday train and in a few hrs it will be 2 days since I charged the phone.I always buy refurbished products and believe they are better than a new product.Why?Simple.While a human spends a few seconds to make sure a mass produced product works, a refurbished product goes through much more rigorous testing and validation. But 'renewed' seems to be a whole different ball-game.10 years ago, the refurbished product I purchase would have some signs of wear.But it seems renewed products are tested, as well as made to look brand new.I literally paid 1/2 the price for a new product.Why would one buy a brand new product instead of this?Oh wait.I know.They probably want the shiny S10+ box right?because this one comes with a generic white box.lol.Happy shopping.",2019年12月22日 在美国审核
Contact Seller before purchasing,I bought this device from the seller OneTouchDeals. Was a little hesitant because the price was so low and the reviews I read. I emailed the seller upon our purchase to confirm in what I was ordering. They assured me that the device would work with T-Mobile and it does perfectly. Device is renewed but it seems brand new to me. I couldn't find A SINGLE SCRATCH on this device. The only giveaway that this is a used device is the box it came in. Other than that it seems like a brand new phone. For $498 I can't complain a single bit. Upgrading from a Galaxy S8+ and I absolutely love my new s10+!,2020年2月8日 在美国审核
A complete waste of time and money,The phone is labelled unlocked but when I tried setting up service with my provider (TMobile) I was told it couldn't be used due to the device being in bad financial standing. So I contact support and they ship me a replacement phone. All done right? Wrong. The replacement phone (which I was waiting to switch to as I was stuck using the faulty first phone) was ALSO in bad financial standing! Contacted support to se if I could get a replacement from anyone else and was told it has to be from the same people who sent out the first two duds in the first place! Not to mention I would have to wait to receive a refund until the previous two phones were received by them! So not only have I been out of a phone for a week I now have to wait on shipping to get a refund. Ridiculous that people can sell these phones under false pretenses.,2020年1月31日 在美国审核
Like new,"After reading some of the reviews I had fingers crossed that the phone would be in acceptable condition, and not turn out to be a stolen phone, which some have claimed. Needless worry. My device was in PRISTINE condition. Looks brand-new. Popped in my SIM card from my Moto G7 (Verizon) and it worked instantly. Using Samsung Smart Switch I wirelessly transferred data, contacts, apps, etc to my new S10+. All my apps were installed on my new phone very quickly. Some which required higher security (medical) needed to have me re-credentialed by the hospital IT dept, but that was relatively painless. I'm so glad to be back with a Samsung device. My 2 year experience with the Moto was dissatisfying. But I REFUSE to pay $1000 or more, or even $500 or more for a cell phone. With my computers and other devices I always stay a few steps behind the bleeding edge. This Amazon Renewed experience has been excellent so far.",2021年7月3日 在美国审核

Amazon Renewed purchase review,"I purchased this through Amazon's Renewed Store fully unlocked. I honestly can not believe how fantastic this phone is given it's a two years old flagship but looks and functions like it's a two months old flagship that was never opened. The innovation of Amazon to create such a huge marketplace for renewed devices to look and function like new with a three month warranty not only helps the environment, these renewed devices are a fraction of the price. It takes a lot to astound me, but this concept is a major major major win win for everyone. Amazon is truly amazing and its concepts are brilliant which is why Amazon is number one in customer centric satisfaction and retail creativity. I am absolutely thrilled with this magnificent still relevant phone, its brand new condition, 90 day warranty, and unbelievable price. I would never hesitate to recommend Amazon Renewed. I was hesitant, but I considered Amazon's policies and the 90 day warranty and purchased with confidence knowing I could return or exchange. You can buy without anxiety.

I called boost and they walked me through the prosess. Easy to do! Everything went great. I was concerned because of all the bad reviews. I think some people stop after the first try when someone gives them wrong information. I just needed to buy a $10 sim card and put it in then call and they turned it on.

Review: 10/10 (Cricket/AT&amp;T Network),"I was kind of scared to purchase this after reading the reviews, (the price difference also gave me pause, so if you're also side eyeing it I feel you.) but after my s8 took damage I took the plunge.☆Service: I am on the Cricket network (AT&amp;T) and everything works fine, I popped my sim in and experienced no interruption in service, to my relief. I also haven't recieved any slow downs with navigation/messages/ect. and I've been using this phone for a month and some change.☆Hardware: The phone itself is great. The camera takes amazing photos (2 cameras in the front, 3 in the back) and I really dig the Flamingo Pink aesthetic. When deliberating over this or the s20+ a big plus was that the s10+ still has its headphone jack. This means I don't have to worry too much if my headphones die on me in the middle of the day, I'll pack a spare and be done with it. The speakers are loud and clear (significantly if this is an upgrade from 2 or more phones ago) and messing with the audio functions (if you're into that) can produce even better sound quality. The infamous camera notch in the top right corner, while obvious at first, is barely visible once you've used the phone for a few minutes and rests comfortably in the notifications bar.☆Software: If you're already familiar with Samsung's flagships it's pretty user friendly and to the point, if you're coming over from the dark side of iPhone, (or other droids) this setup will take some getting used to. Dedicate a bit to learning the inner workings of your phone and maybe breeze through a youtube video to check out all the neat stuff it can do. The processor is fast and clean and the screen is vibrant and responsive.All in all I am very happy with my purchase and enjoy the device. I personally don't see myself upgrading for at least another 3 Galaxy's.",2020年4月17日 在美国审核
Absolutely great deal unless your on AT&amp;T Network,"Phone arrived on time and was as described, not a single scratch - just like new.The listing states the device will work on any US GSM carrier, and this is partially correct.This is the ""F"" variant of the S10+ and doesn't support Band 30, if you're on AT&amp;T you will likely notice decreased data speeds (no LTE+/5GE). You will especially notice the difference if you live in a major metro area where carrier aggregation is in place.If you're a T-Mobile customer you're fine. I normally get speeds between 20-50Mbps on AT&amp;T and with this device (missing Band 30) I get between 1-5Mbps.Great device, great deal, will probably return next week.",2019年9月20日 在美国审核
Best phone I've owned so far!,"I'm extremely happy with my purchase! This was a major upgrade for me upgrading from an iPhone Xr . I was seriously sick of iOS and missed my old experience on my Samsung S8 which broke and Ihad a deal on iPhone so was like ""why not.."" regretted that decision. Ever since they released the galaxy S10+ I've been earger to get my hands on it.The device I recieved was pre-packaged in a Amazon renewed unit box but seems to be BRAND NEW. You won't tell the difference if it was used, refurbished or open box new. The phone is incredible, extremely fast and snappy. Was extremely easy to setup too. Just signed into google account and instantly recovered my favorite layout and settings so it made the transition that much easier. The camera quality is fascinating. Beats the iPhones camera quality by miles. Can take low light photos very well and the 5 different cameras really make a photo taking experience that much better with so many different modes to play with. The battery life is extremely great! My iPhone would die in literally a half of my s10+ battery charge. And I tell ya, I really missed fast-charging! iPhone always took about 5 hours to charge. Which I hated so much. And it died so fast. While my new s10 I get a 10% to 100% fast charge in just a little over an hour. I couldn't be any happier honestly!Especially for the price! It's a steal!

GREAT service and quality.. not the item for me.,"I was fairly cautious buying a refurbished phone for the first time but I feel that the first thing I should put here is that I was VERY surprised by the quality received. The phone was nearly spotless and functioned with the snappy response you would want to see from a flagship phone (even a two year old one). As advertised it comes in a box that is not the factory direct one, (something that many reviewers seemed to somehow miss written 2-3 times in the description). All in all, the phone had a ""peely"" screen protector within a thick phone shaped bubble wrap ziploc, within a high quality phone box that sperated the peripherals (charging cable and sim pin) from the device and all of that was in a small sturdy ship box. I received the phone two days earlier than slated to but that is probably just because it was only from new Jersey to Connecticut. The phone powered on very quickly and stayed on for over 30mins on 1% charge before I plugged it in.Now to the only unfortunate part. I use a somewhat indy carrier whom I am pretty attached to called Republic Wireless. The galaxy s10+ IS compatible with them but ONLY the somewhat rare factory unlocked model (SM-G975UZKAXAA or SM-G975U1 when abbreviated in the phone's settings). This listing is for unlocked models NOT necessarily FACTORY unlocked models. So the unfortunate result was me receiving an unlocked model SM-G975UZKAVZW or the Verizon model. It's worth noting that more than 95% of you out there will not have an issue with this difference but for me this made the phone completely unusable.That leads me to the last part of my review and the reason I wanted to leave this review after my experience as a whole.On realizing that I had an unusable phone I was understandably disappointed and frustrated and reached out to both the seller (PromoDealz) and Amazon. Admittedly, seeing a name that sounds like a corner pawn shop (truly no offense guys, I'm not what the kids call hip..lol) I was a little worried about the follow up I'd receive but that anticipation, like the ones about a refurbished phone in general, was blown away. What I got was quick clear responses with nothing but the intent to try to help me out. After they had gone through their whole inventory to check for what I needed based on my messaged information they offered to extend contact to phone and we connected to discuss the problem. They didn't make me feel like I was being a hassle at all as they took all the information I could find on what phones work for me and checked their entire stock of s10+ (50ish pieces) then offered to receive their next shipment of 200+ pieces and check those too. These folks seem like good people who are dedicated providing a good service here. Hopefully they weren't cursing me behind my back lol. Wouldn't blame 'em.Unfortunately after the hunt they didn't come up with what I needed and, as they had offered as a worst case (or immediate if I'd preferred) solution all along we processed a return/refund. I somewhat assume that the carrier specific models of this phone are vastly more common because most people buying $800+ flagship phones are doing so because of incentives, financing and deals through larger carriers (""get a new family plan and get FOUR free* super flagship phones at only $300/month"" *phones free for first two months then at a monthly payment plan of $150/month for 97 months and a $700 plan cancellation fee applies when you find all the other plans out there for a quarter the cost.... Sorry I'm a bit biased against big carriers).Anyway, all in all, I'm shocked you're still reading this. I'm a lot less concerned about the refurbished concept after seeing the quality of the phone received as well as the quality of the seller's support and Amazon's backing. (Amazon support fellow actually said ""don't worry, we've got your back if you get any trouble from the seller"" luckily no trouble so I didn't have to call big brother)You still reading this?Why? Go read a book. Or like, listen to one or something.Terry Goodkind's sword of truth series has good audiobooks... On the road listening maybe?Too lame? Maybe go watch something on netflix or disney+?Falcon and Winter Soldier is not bad so far...Evil Genius was good for you true crime nuts..Seriously.I of all people am not that entertaining.At least go find yourself a phone.

Pleasantly Surprised,"I was very skeptical because of some of the negative reviews, but decided to see for myself given the great price (I always buy refurbished) and good return policy.This is a fully unlocked Galaxy 10+. Transitioning my SIM card and files from my old phone was a breeze.I found 1 very minor knick on an edge- it took effort to find the very tiny scratch. Definitely not a deal breaker, and honestly was very impressed with the asthetic condition of the phone. Cameras are prestine and free of marks, screen has no flaws, and the battery life seems good so far.Zero issues here- very satisfied with this purchase and feel like I got a fantastic deal.Again, I always buy refurbished and don’t expect complete perfection and original factory packaging. However I do expect the device to be of good quality at a reasonable price- and this delivered on that.If you're a skeptic and can live with a couple hairline scratches on the case, just go for it. You can always return if you're not satisfied, but based off my experience I would bet you'll be pleasantly surprised.",2021年2月17日 在美国审核
"Still a little Weary, but Feeling Mostly Good about CPRTX!","Ordered from CPRTX!!The phone was expected between May 17-20th, but it came today, May 15th! Very fast delivery from CPRTX!So far, what I can say about the phone is that the screen is perfect. I did notice very, very, veryyyyyy minor scratches on the back panel of the phone—however, I only noticed them because I specifically held a flashlight up to the phone to see if there were any (I noticed 3 really short, really thin scratches in total). Otherwise, they are not at all noticeable! The phone works like a brand new device, but my only con is that the charger I received from CPRTX makes the phone HOT, very hot, because it is not a Samsung-made charger. I will buy a legitimate charger instead (and I recommend other buyers do the same) because I don’t want to risk damaging the battery. Also, the phone has to perform individual updates a loooooot (it was originally released in 2019 and it is now 2021, so it is understandable), and as phones that have to go through a constant cycle would have it, it gets a little hot at times. I prefer to update my phone with it charging, but I can’t due to the charger problem that I stated earlier, so I’m going to give the battery life rating 2 stars. After 3 updates, the battery dropped from 73% to 68%, which isn’t bad! Otherwise, I’m feeling happy with my purchase. It’s only been a few hours so I will give a new update after 1 week, then another after 1 month!Thank you CPRTX! Please send 100% real Samsung chargers with the devices next time!",2021年5月15日 在美国审核

BAD PHONE BATTERY AND POOR QC,"Essentially, the S10+ had a battery problem from the get go. It had 18% battery charge when I received it, pretty normal. It took over 12 hours to charge. Normal charge time would be about 4 to 6 hours. The next day I usedit like my s8+, calls, texts, news etc. The heat coming off the phone was like a radiator, w no cover on yet. It used a full charge in less than 5 hours. Down to about 28% charge left. I went to the battery utility, it showed no excessive battery use. Obviously Ihad a bad battery, no replacement battery, they are permanent.I got an RMA FROM THE third party vendor. He said he would send another one. He said he had many in stock. He never did and played me for several days. Had to call AMAZON to back up the warranty.The phone itself was in perfect condition. Pristine indeed.

I brought because of the camera and it has not disappointed!!!! Wow and the fast charging is awesome!! And it's also a tough phone no screen protector have dropped it soo much not even a scratch but I am getting a screen protector though I don't wanna run out of luck lol but wow storage is incredible just like S9+ and I am with boost mobile all I had to do was call them switching it to my service provider was not hard. The only issue I have is it did glitch once and turned off but after a few moments it was like it never happened also the water detector after getting the charger a little wet the water detector caught it quickly and dried sooo much more faster then my galaxy s9+ it would take FOREVER to get the water out of my galaxy s9+ sometimes hrs NOT WITH THIS PHONE IT LITERALLY TAKES LIKE 2 OR 3 MINS!! And the speakers are sooo loud for a mini get together I didn't even need to hook it up to a speaker!! The only problem I did have is it glitch once turned off and turned back on a few times not sure if I dropped it without the gas a little too hard or it was self updatingidk but then it was like it never happened and it hasn't happened since I LOVE LOVE MY PHONE THANK YOU!!!,2020年7月1日 在美国审核

"Wow, what a deal! Believe the good review score and get the S10+.","This is the second of the two Amazon Renewed items I've bought, the other was a Galaxy Tab, that has lived up to the good review score and impressed me with its condition. I got the S10+ which is only $20 more than the base model and has a bigger screen and 17% bigger battery. It looks and feels brand new, the only exception being the slightest amount of wear around the charging port. The screen works perfectly, with no pixel issues.I'm very happy I decided to go with this formerly top-of-the-line 2019 model instead of the current versions. It looks and feels like a luxury item and the screen design stands out today against to the run-of-the-mill looking S20, 21, and 22 models (S22 Ultra excepted). I can't believe how smooth the front screen is. It's so smooth, in fact, that it begins to glide across any smooth surface that isn't level, so it may end up somewhere other than where you left it like the hard floor. Safer to put it backside down.The fingerprint reader is built in to the screen and thus invisible. I gave it 4 stars only because my previous phone has a dedicated reader on the back that is instant, and it's what I've become accustomed to. The reader on the S10 takes about half a second to register. It has a cool factor, though, in that it works even with the screen off.I gave the battery 4 stars because it was down to 75% after 1 day of light use which is a bit less than I had expected/hoped for. I feel like it got worse after I ran all the system updates vs how it behaved out of the box; I remember being surprised at how little the battery had gone down when doing all the app installations and settings. I have pretty poor cell reception though so it may be due to trying to constantly communicate with the cell tower. Also the battery screen says it's ""learning"" my usage habits so hopefully it will improve.That being said, these are minor sticking points compared to what you get, and overall its 4.5 - 5 stars for me. I doubt there is a phone anywhere near its specs and condition for the price, currently $220 for this formerly $1,000 phone.

FWIW I bought from Chubbies and got a SM-G975U1 with the Snapdragon 855 and it works with TMobile.Edit: surprisingly the display isn't set to the max possible 3040 x 1440 by default.

"Other reviews sketchy, but my phone works 100%","I was afraid it'd be reported as stolen when I'd try to activate it. Luckily, it's the real deal.The phone arrived in an unmarked box, and inside was the phone, a charging cord of roughly 3ft in length, and an off-brand charging brick. every part was wrapped in plastic. Upon initial examination, the screen glass was fresh, not a single mark could be seen, but the back glass had minor scratches, nothing to really freak out about. The metal bezel around the cameras had very minor scuffs and dings, but, again, nothing too serious. There were no cracks on any surface.This phone was powered on directly out of the box with about 90% charge left. No screen burns or afterimaging were visible. After setup, I tested each function. Cameras worked fine, fingerprint sensor worked as well. It took a charge. The accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, heartbeat sensor, compass, and GPS are perfectly functional.I had called my service provider to activate this phone. No issues with this phone were detected by them, and this phone is shown as fully unlocked and in good standing.All in all, this is a phenomenal phone, and it seems that I didn't get a stolen phone, contrary to the reviews I had read prior to purchasing.This review was typed on the phone purchased.",2021年7月16日 在美国审核

Works perfectly and looks brand new,"As I said in the headline, even though this is a used phone it works perfectly and looks brand new. Cosmetically, there is not a scratch or scuff anywhere on the phone. The screen is perfect.<br>The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the battery life. I purchased this phone because of all the reviews I had read and watched on YouTube. This phone was supposed to have one of the best battery lifes last year. When you purchase a “renewed” phone from Amazon if you purchase an iPhone one of the rules is that the phone must have an 80% battery life. However, Android phones don't have to meet that criterion. So until you get a phone there is no telling what the battery life is like. Like I said, I purchased this phone based on what I thought the battery life would be. Why not lease is OK it's actually know better than in old iPhone that I had before this. Renewed phones do have a 90 day guarantee so I could return the phone and try to get one with a better battery. But this phone does work perfectly otherwise. I had wanted to switch back from and Apple phone to an Android so I think I will just keep it. It's only a mild let down. The seller of the phone could have done exactly what I did, just download any one of 1,000,000 free battery applications and found out what the battery life is. It's just a little surprising because this phone has only been out for one year and the iPhone that this is replacing is 4 years old.</br>",2020年8月29日 在美国审核

Good phone to have,"Ordered the S10+ just a few weeks ago. Glad I ordered it from the seller I chose. Phone arrived in like new condition without a single scratch. Outperforms my older S model. The battery is good, charging is fast and it performs well. The one thing I hate is the garbage and bloatware preinstalled by both Google and Samsung. Useless trash that most people don't need. And yeah the new Android sucks and is the worst that Google ever released. Google just like Microsoft and many other tech companies release new editions of software platforms till they get to perfect and then instead of keeping it on the market for people to enjoy start releasing newer degradedAndroid versions with the newest being worse than the previous. And now the new Android is a f-d up piece of garbage. Google maps is the only thing that has improved. Everything else is thumb down. But the phone itself is good.",2022年6月13日 在美国审核

"Undated Review.  The 5-stars is for Wireless Dealz, not the phone.","It looks absolutely, without a single doubt, brand new! ...updated review. One month later.I've done EVERYTHING I can, took it to Tmobile and had them mess with tower selections and fast tower switching.This phone did everything GREAT...except make calls.It wouldn't hold onto a LTE tower for more than 10 minutes and NEVER could get on a 3G. Forget 4G, not once ever.Luckily, I held onto my S9+, which this was to replace. Just put my sim card back in it, turned it on and yep, I'm getting solid 4G connectivity with no drops.Unfortunate.I don't blame Wireless Dealz.This slip could have happened to anyone and it would be very difficult to detect until someone used it for a longer period of time.I'm sending the phone back RMA.AT LEAST they honor their word and gave me no trouble getting the RMA!Thank you.

Great for a refurb!,"I'm always nervous buying refurbished electronics. I've been screwed over in the past, and so I'm extra super careful.That being said, I took a huge risk ordering this device, only after looking through the different sellers and their ratings.I settled on one sold by Hybrid IT, and let me tell you! The device looked practically brand new! There were 2 small dings in the metal frame, but honestly, I didn't even notice them at first! The screen and back were pristine, not even a scuff, and all ports &amp; speakers worked perfectly!My phone carrier is MetroPCS/Metro by T-Mobile, so I did have to take my new phone in for a new sim/IMEI change ($20 activation fee in my area), but that was a short 5-10 minute process to get me up and running. I haven't had any service problems at all, which I know can happen with a used device, but all is good here.I've had the phone for about a month now, even going on a weekend trip to an anime convention, and it's held up very well.

More than happy with the S10+ (refurb.),"I ran my Samsung S7 Edge into the ground and after 4 years and 11 months, and the battery not lasting a day, I finally upgraded. For me, a phone is just a tool so my replacement simply needs to be quality, economical, with a good battery life. Having a phone with strong photo and video capability is also important and the technology has come a long way in 5 years. I am VERY happy with the S10+ and even refurbished, with regular use (but not an extreme gamer, video watcher, or teen-texter), the battery easily lasts more than a day. Typically, I just recharge every night but now, I don't even have to do that! It has all the features you'd want in a smartphone today, even though it's a 2-year old model. I'm still learning all of the features which will be fun, in time. Thankfully, the Smart Samsung transfer was seamless because just a half-day later, my S7 Edge completely died and will not reboot.

An absolute Steal for the Price While Helping to Reduce E-Waste. That's a Win/Win in My Opinion,"The phone is rgeat. The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold and USE. Whather just checking your mail playing a game or using Google.docs, with 8GB of RAM and the Top SoC chip from 2019 at it's heart. Great pics, great video, and you absolutely will not find a better phone in the US under $600 USD, never mind the $200-$285 this typically sells for. It also has a headphone jack for one of the 35 sets of earbuds you've collected over the ages. Standard USB charging without the annoying port that Galaxy's normally have.The 1080p 90 FPS (?) widescreen allows for great video playback as well as gaming, which the afore mentioned SoC and the 8GB of RAM help immensely with. $1100 USD two years ago, less than $300 now, unlocked, works great with Verizon, Sprint, AT&amp;T, Mint, Straight Talk etc etc. The internal 128GB of memory is nice, as is the ability to drop in another $30 128 GB mini sdcard in if you're going to be recording a LOT of video without the ability to get to a PC or Laptop (Or just upload it to the cloud) for some reason. You an also carry around an extra cadrd or two if you want to record 10 hours at 4k for whatever reason.Voice quality is awesome, voice recognition is great, though you may want to keep it off for pricacy; it's just a kickass phone.It was also advertised as in ""Good Shape"" when irl, it was in ""New: condition save the battery which was at 95% available cells. Worth every penny, and if you have a kid, or you like to consume media and play games on your phone, besides an iPhone with it's unbelievable new SoC, this is right up there with any other current flagship (And it can play Fortnite along with numerous other gmes not on iOS for whatever reason). I could go on and on about the productivity, lack of Bloatware besides Knoxx Security and Bixby (It has Mcaffee but never, ever use that. Get the free version of Avast and Malwarebytes, or lol, anything but Mcafee or Norton's). You can also just wipe it and install whatever OS you like, though sticking with Android is advised do to drivers, but you do you, as it's great to tinker with and fantastic out of the box.Hope this review helped, and the seller get's an A double plus on this one.",2021年10月13日 在美国审核

Arrived in flawless condition. Magnificent phone.,"The phone arrived in flawless condition and only contained an extremely tiny little scratch next to the front camera lens.Watching videos on this giant Quad HD display is outstanding.The added telephoto and wide angle cameras make for very bright and beautiful colors allowing you to take many diffrent types of pictures.All SM-G975U1 models of the S10+ come with the Snapdragon 855 and are be factory unlocked. The 855 processor with 8gb of ram is still plenty in 2020. If you plan on having this for a while you might want to consider getting the upgraded storage, or buying a micro SD down the line.The phone still has the headphone jack, and 15w fast charger.My example came with a Samsung Adaptive Charge brick, and an unbranded 4ft black cable. The phone came cool to the touch in bubble wrap.The battery is 4100mah and has so far been plenty to last me through a heavy day of usage. As it is being bought renewed this can vary with each device as some may have been used more, therefore some batteries could be more degraded than others.But in the long run this phone is still amazing in 2020.

Excellent condition!,"So far it's EXACTLY as described. This is the first time I've bought refurbished, and I must say I'm impressed with the quality that I received and I'll probably end up buying refurbished for my next phone. I popped my AT&amp;T sim card in and memory card and it worked immediately. After a few updates and setups I was ready to go. The phone I received was factory unlocked like advertised. I seen a few reviews where they received carrier locked phones, but mine was unlocked. There was literally not a scratch on this phone. It came with a generic box that was sealed, came with new generic charger and cord (was not fast charging block though, but no big deal as I already had one). Speaking of charging, I was a bit worried when I first got it because the phone would start charging and then all of a sudden stop. I would wiggle the cord around and it would start working again, and then stop right after. I thought for sure I was going to have to send it back, and I didn't want to after it was perfect condition and unlocked. However I switched cords I was using and so far it hasn't done it yet, but it's only been a day. If I starts back, I'll have to send it back because what good is a phone if you can't charge it? I know it has wireless charging, but I paid for a phone to work completely and that's what I would want. Besides I don't even have a wireless charger, and wouldn't want to spend the extra money on it when it should charge by cord in the first place. Anyways I'm hoping it was just my cord, but it's weird it didn't do that on my other phone. I will update review later after I see how that goes and hope it's not the charging port going out. Battery life is so so, I mean it's probably expected for a refurbished phone I suppose. It does go down pretty quick, but I'm sure it's where I've been on it nonstop since I opened it too. Will update review later on over battery life too. Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase! The seller I used was OlympicWireless I believe that's how it was spelled. Very satisfied SO far. The blue is very nice on this phone and I'm glad I got the blue instead of the black like I was originally going too.

I was very apprehensive, but in the end I'm 100% glad I did.I was shipped two items in a plain white box: a Galaxy S10+ phone and a charger.* The charger was an off-brand and it works just fine - just be aware that it's not a ""fast-charger"", so you might want to buy one à la carte.As far as the phone itself? AMAZING! I love it.** As far as quality it really did look brand new. There were literally no marks, dents, or even hairline scratches. I was super impressed actually. My package even shipped a day early, so that was sweet.Overall, I'd say don't be afraid to buy a used phone from this seller so long as it's backed by Amazon as ""Renewed"" - that's very important.

In the upper left corner, it now says ""Prefered System"" instead of Verizon, etc. I was able to get rid of the T-Mobile app by using ADB (four packages). The only bummer is that you cannot get rid of the T-Mobile start/finish logo with a very loud jingle!

It's important who you buy from.,"The most misleading part of reading these reviews is that most don't identify the seller. This review is mostly about the seller which was Hybrid IT.

The phone only had minor scratches on the top and bottom edges the screen was like new and back was very clean. I did have to use Odin to flash my providers firmware but after that all features including wifi calling which would not work with the firmware it was sent with. This is not really the sellers fault but something you should consider that you may have to do the same thing to get the full functionality out of it. Mine was flashed with AT&amp;T firmware but all are available from Samsung. I read many reviews that said it would not work with Xfinty which is not true with the right firmware.

In all other ways, it has been a dream come true for me, finally stepping into the twenty-first century from an old iPhone. It's wonderful to have tons of space on the phone, and the cameras take immeasurably better photos than my old iPhone (a 6). The real selling point of this phone for me was the sound, however. I love that it still has the 3.5 mm headphone jack. I use my phone more like an iPod or other music player, so the great sound from this phone was all I had hoped for. For those on a budget who want something that can last more than a few months, I highly recommend this refurbished phone.",2020年1月11日 在美国审核

Best value for the price,"My Galaxy S10 Plus arrived in near new condition. Upon expecting it there was only a extremely fine 8 mm long scratch on the bottom third of the screen, and impossible to see unless you are really looking for it.

At the end of each day I still have had around 60-70% battery remaining. I have not encountered any stutters or slowing performance whatsoever. The screen is beautiful and crisp, with no dead pixels. The cameras both front and rear take sharp images, and the focusing is quick and accurate.I also purchased a Galaxy Watch Active from Amazon Renewed and it is like new as well. I didn't want to spend $1000+ on a phone, and typically buy whatever looks like the best mid range phone for the price, with some good features, and others not so good.

You'll be surprised to get a great phone for a cheaper price,"I was skeptical about buying a phone online as you never know what to expect.

There were no scratches on the phone (I'm a perfectionist and like my phones without any damage) it also came with the original charger. Some people in previous comments mention there wasn't an original charger, but there was with mine. Also, others were concern with the phone carrier and if the phone is fully unlocked. I will like to say that the phone I received was described as fully unlocked and I also have AT&amp;T prepaid and the sim card corresponded to the phone perfectly.

Copying the sample IMEI that the seller gave to one person's question into Sprint's device checker showed compatibility. Also, it is a factory unlocked device (Unlocked by Samsung) - when you check on the ""Unlocked by Samsung"" website, you see that they state that the devices will work on all major U.S. networks - both GSM and CDMA! I received it yesterday and got it registered and activated today. Receiving calls, texts, and wifi calling all seem to operate as expected. Upon activation, the phone even downloaded some Sprint apps for account management and such. All is looking good.",2020年2月29日 在美国审核

"Great phone, worth saving your money!","At first I was skeptical of getting a used phone on the web but I'm happy I did, to save me some money. I love my phone, even though I have been so nutty going back and forth with trying out Samsung S10, S10 Note and now S10+. I love the ability to use wifi calling but wished texting was the same concept too. A lot of my texts takes a while since I have very little cellular bar. Cuz I live in an area, that has shotty cell service to all phone carriers. I'm happy with the memory of the phone and the sd expandable storage. The battery life get me through majority of my 12 hour work day. I'm not crazy about the finger scan lock screen, so most of the time I use the patern instead. And the speaker port on the bottom of the screen is poorly designed but okay. I like the option of a headphone jack. And this phone does everything I need a smartphone to do. I'mvery happy with my purchase.",2021年10月12日 在美国审核

How to keep your customers.,"I'll keep this honest.Buying an S10+ 1T, for $718.88 (half the price of a brand new one at $1499) is a lot of penny's to give up. I happily admit that I have no regrets doing so. I've been a Samsung customer since the S4, S6, S8 and now this.I was definitely sketched out purchasing a renewed phone from Amazon, as it was my first time doing so in general. Especially with a bunch of 1 star reviews claiming it's a scam and not unlocked. But I'm definitely impressed! The phone was delivered literally 2 days after purchasing, and it came with only a charger as an addition, no complaints there.Also I didn't have to change my carrier or anything booting it up, as the description indicates it's a Verizon unlocked phone. All I did was insert my sim card and expandable storage sd card in (only 1 slot space) and it connected right away to T-mobile without a hiccup.I'm content with this purchase.",2020年5月7日 在美国审核
"Best ""sweet spot"" at the moment","I never am a ""technology"" leader, having to have the lastest and greatest.I typically hang a few iterations back, as prices drop and the phones typically have bugs worked out and I've allowed other adopyers to pay the ""full price"".That said, I've recently decided to move on from my S8 Plus and purchase the S10. At a minimal outlay of cash, the improvements in the phone from the 8 to the 10 are easily warranting the upgrade. The camera improvements alone warrant the move.Very happy with the purchase. Several independent reviewers cited the S10 as the best phone of , and I'm inclined to agree.I didnt see a justification to jump up to the S20 just yet.",2021年1月22日 在美国审核

I'm so glad I got it, it doesn't look like it's ever been used. No cosmetic damages. It's been 5 days and everything thing has been a smooth transition from my old phone to this 1.Since it was unlocked all I had to do was put in tmobile sims card to get service didn't have to call and set up anything. I did checked imei code when I 1st got it bc I was told to do that before anything else and its clean.When I initially started set up the setting was in English but Australian not America but that was easy to change. I also had to change setting on conversions like °C to °F etc.The camera is clear and screen is smooth the curved edges don't bother me at all when I'm using the phone.I will definitely be buying from this company againin the future.",2019年11月10日 在美国审核

From not so good to excellent,"The first phone I ordered arrived well packaged cosmetically goodwith just a slight chip on the bottom left, to be expected from a used phone,not not a problem, especially when inside the case. The problem however was mobile network performance.Connection on T-Mobile was intermittent to non existentAfter a getting a new sim card twice, and a couple hours on the phone with t-mobile things were looking hopeful,but in the end network performance even witheven a a five bar signal was intermittent to non existent.Turning off and on mobile networks along with switching between airplane mode usually could establish a connection for a short time. My suspicion ended up being that this was not an actual t-mobile phone, as I once had very similar results with an unlocked Verizon phone on the T-mobile network. I returned the phone and a few days later the replacement had arrived.When I turned the replacement on I immediately noticed ed a difference.Unlike the original, at-mobile logo appeared with the familiar jingle.Needless to say the phone is working flawlessly and cosmetically better than expectedwith no visible blemishes at all.

Going to five star it for now.,"I'll update if I find any issues.So far, I've found none. However, if you are looking for a completely untouched phone, I suggest going new.This is a renewed phone. You may get one that's unscathed and looks pristine, you may get one that has dings and scratches on it. That is the price you're going to pay for going the cheaper, renewed route. The only thing that mattered to me was that the screen was flawless and it worked well. All I'm saying is make plans to cover any dings (and to protect your investment).Mine came with a bunch of little dings and scratches along the edges but I had already planned ahead of time on using a waterproof case that covers everything. The screen is in perfect condition, as well as the backing, and the phone runs like a dream. Even if the backing wasn't perfect, I was planning on covering it with a decal anyway.I am waiting for that decal to come in because the case I chose is hell to put on and take off. I know from my previous phone.It's a Lanhiem underwater case with a built-in screen protector and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a case that you don't plan on taking off for a while (and have a clear backing to show off the back of the phone/decals). I don't plan on going underwater with it either.Edit: SD card and Sim Card worked flawlessly. Got impatient and decided to start using the phone without the decal since my s9+ had that green tint screen issue that started to worsen.I'll come back if there's anything to report.

Amazon Renewed is where it's at!,"I must say I was very skeptical at first.I have heard unfortunate stories where people would go and buy a refurb phone and when they get it it comes and doesn't charge, has scratches, etc. What I didn't want to happen is to buy the phone, then it comes and turns out its bad and I have to return it. That's such a hassle and a waste of weeks with waiting for a refund or for them to send out a new one so I totally understand anyone reading this if they are hesitant. It took me 3 days to decide to take the risk. Anyways, I ordered a Galaxy S10+ from FiestaRenew (make sure you know who the seller is and check their seller page ratings as the quality of the refurb is based on this!) and when it came it was packaged nicely and came with a charger and SIM card slot opener. Unfortunately, the charging cable that came with it was bad and could not fast charge the phone so I used the USB-C charger I had from my previous phone and that worked perfectly. After further inspection of the hardware and testing of my mobile connection (I have T-Mobile) I confirmed that everything is working perfectly and as it should. Honestly, there is no point in buying a new S10+ if you can get a refurb one. If I handed someone my phone they would think it was new just bought.

Product Exactly as Described! Fast Shipping! Amazing Phone!,"Pros: Exactly as described<br>Fast ShippingGreat Phone at a great priceCons: None, it's a Galaxy S10+ that was exactly as described by the seller.I bought two of these Galaxy S10+ from CR Daily Deals - Amazon Renewed, one for my husband (upgrading from galaxy S5) and one for myself (upgrading from Galaxy S7 Edge). Both phones showed up a day earlier than originally projected, exactly as described.The phones are both beautiful, no scratches on the front or back glass, no scuff marks or scratches on any of the sides or corners. Both did come in completely uncharged, so expect to give it a full charging before starting your setup. They did not come with Samsung branded chargers as advertised, however the charger they did come with does not feel flimsy at all, and provided a very fast charge to the phone.Phone is fully GSM Unlocked as advertised, we both use Straight Talk and upon swapping sim cards from old phones to new the service was immediately active. There were two software updates available, easy to find through the phone settings, and both updates only took around 20 minutes.Cameras front and back work like new on both phones. All buttons seem to work. I chose not to rate the fingerprint reader or the face recognition yet as I haven't used those features yet. I will update this if and when I do.Overall it's an amazing phone that showed up exactly as advertised. Looking at it laying here I wouldn't know it wasn't a new phone if I hadn't bought it renewed myself.

Seller shipped via FedEx.....many problems occurred with shipper. Missed delivery date (item was not delivered by end of day), FedEx didn't want to ship over the weekend with FedEx center less than 30 mins away.

"Great, almost perfect.","I saw more than a few mixed reviews for buying renewed. My seller for buying renewed was TradeMore Services. Happy to report that my experience has been great, with one small hiccup. Looks brand new without any scratches. Checked the battery capacity with an app called Accubattery and the battery is rated at 96%. Everything so far is working as it should.About the hiccup. The phone I received was a Verizon unlocked phone and my sim card worked but with a limitation at first. I could call, send/receive texts and had internet on my phone. However at first it was only limited to 3G data. I contacted the seller and they told me they were happy to refund me if the issue wasn't solvable and recommended double checking the settings. I Googled the issue and manually reset a few things on viola! The 4G LTE is now working on the phone.Overall very happy with the phone.",2020年9月24日 在美国审核
Like New Condition,"Amazon renewed is an outstanding program. The device arrived in like new condition. You could not distinguish the device externally from a new device. The only possible issue I have noticed is that the battery drains a little quicker than I expected. However it lasts much longer than my old iPhone and it charges much quicker than my old phone. It might just be the nature of smart phone batteries or it might be a slightly bad battery. But it is barely enough to notice and it lasts so much longer than my old iPhone, that I decided to keep the phone and not return it. I would recommend Amazon renewed to anyone.",2020年12月4日 在美国审核
Better than New!,I purchased 2 of the Samsung Galaxy S10+ Factory Unlocked Phones with 512GB for the price of 1 and I am COMPLETELY SATISFIED with this purchase. The phones arrived on time and without a blemish on either phone. I was able to transfer the SIM (Cricket Wireless) from our old phones and start using them immediately. We recently received the Android 10/One UI-2 OTA update from Samsung which added some additional features and increased battery life to 2 days (Dark Mode) between charge. I GIVE THEM FIVE STARS X 2,2019年12月27日 在美国审核
99.95 satisfied  and a good purchase,The only thing you need to know about this phone . Is that it dont come on any instructions is. The little key like pin that come with the phone. Is used to push in a hole in the top right corner of phone. Aproxmotly a inch and a quarter in. The slot for the sd card and sims card pops up. They both go on the slider.And you might wanna get a usb c cable. Mine was brand new with the phone.But didn't work. It also comes with a quick charger which works well.Besides that It is a brand new phone. With no scratches at all. And it was packed well and the delivery was real fast.

Great Phone. Great Deal.,"I would say this is more of a review on the renewed program rather than the S10+ overall.I was a little skeptical of ordering something refurbished, but with a $400 cheaper price tag than a new S10+, I had to try it out first. I ordered a Galaxy S10+ from FiestaRenew and so far everything has been great. The shipping was quick, according to Amazon, it was supposed to take about a week and a half, but I received it in just two days. It came in a generic box but the charging adapter and cable provided seems like genuine OEM parts. The device itself looks incredible. As far as I can tell, everything works as intended, the fingerprint sensor, the cameras, the display, the buttons and the charging port, the headphone jack, however I've yet to test the SD card reader. The battery still has 95% of the original capacity according to Accubattery, so much better than the 80% promised by the renewed program and it lasts me a full day easily.The only ""notable"" imperfection is a small hairline scratch on the bottom right of the back of the phone, which is no big deal. The only thing I'm not sure about is whether or not it still has the IP68 certification since it is refurbished.",2020年7月12日 在美国审核
Solid feel &amp; easy to use.,"It's a Samsung.This Galaxy phone is very fast with plenty of memory. I easily (and inexpensively) added another 256GB of memory. I save all my pictures, videos, and documents there. The phone allows me to use encryption to secure this data as well as secure the data on the internal memory.It also has a split-screen capability that is a game-changer, at least for me. Wow, what at difference it makes!It's slim, so it fits easily in the palm of my hand, but because it's a little taller than other phones, the pictures and videos look superb!It definitely is an excellent phone specially for its low cost.",2020年1月10日 在美国审核
BUYER BEWARE,"My previous review is below written when I received this item on October 14 2019.As noted in that review the phone came with a screen protector which effectively disabled the fingerprint sensor.I considered removing the screen protector until today, January 22 2020 when I removed it.It is then that I discovered that the real reason for the seller adding the screen protector.The screen below had deep scratches and chips hidden by the screen protector.The seller should list these defects - but they did not.I will see if Amazon will honor a replacement.-----Previous review October 2019Just received this yesterday as a replacement for my beloved but expired S6 Active.So far so good.It arrived in an Amazon renewed box with a charger that is not a Fast Charger - it just cable charges which is very slow - so discard the charger and just use your old fast charger or buy a new one.The phone looksnew with no visible defects - except one - whichappears to be caused by the screen protector that has been applied to the display screen.On the fingerprint sensor there is a quarter moon of what appears to be micro-bubbles from the glue of the protector - which I initially thought was an abrasion.This causes the sensor not to ""see"" a fingerprint.When attempting to set this up the Samsung software complains that the sensor is dirty.This S10 plus is an Australian with an Exynos processor which is used on Samsung phones in the UK, Europe, Asia, Australia, etc.The US phones use the Snapdragon processor which is supposed to have marginally better GPU performance.The phone (GSM) works perfectly on ATT's network and it was just a matter of contacting the provider to register the IME of the microcard with the new phone.Fortunately, most of my settings, Apps , Contacts, etc, were previously backed up to the Samsung Cloud so restoring them to the new phone was not difficult.I recommend remapping the Bixby key to open your preferred App and downloading and configuring Google Assistant which is superior, imho.The only irritation is the problem with the fingerprint sensor which I could possibly resolve by removing the screen protector.Otherwise - a good bargain. (Caveat -reviewed after only one day of use.)",2019年10月15日 在美国审核
Really good for value,"Thinking about it now, I almost gave up buying one of this because of some reviews here. But it was half of the price, so I went for it.Package arrive at the hotel, I ripped it open and there was the box. My fear was to open the box and find a somewhat damage phone. When I got it out of the box it even had the protector you need to pilled off from an original phone. I got it off and there was a brand new phone, with no scratch and for almost half of the price. It was so wonderful!!!Went to a trip to New York with my wife and we took so many pictures there. The phone really helped on capture that magical city. And so far I have no problems with it.

The battery life is so much better than my last phone so I have no complaints. I'm extremely happy. It also came with a thing to stick in the sim card holder to pull it out, before when buying refurbished phones they never do that so I end up having to use my earring so that was a major plus in my book.

Exceptional quality despite the sketchy reviews you see on these types of products.,"I have to say I was a little sketched out because their promised delivery date was 10 days out and I've seen reviews where instead of a smartphone, a burner flip phone was inside the case.I got it two days after I ordered. The packing was sturdy. There was definitely an S10+ in there.Now don't expect the original packaging, they print their own cardboard box in varying sizes for the different phones I imagine, which means you don't have to worry about cutting the box as you get into the package, if you'd like to save the box for display proposes.Onto the phone, it's wrapped in plastic and has a peel off cover on the front. Upon peeling it off... Amazing. Just a few tiny scratches, like the ones you'd get just from putting it in your pocket without a screen protector, only visible upon a scrutinizing glare against the light. No chips, dings, cracks, scratches on the back, nothing. Came halfway charged with a AC adapter and a type C cable, both Samsung and not third party.No major phone brand company logo on the boot screen. No bloatware. Stuck my SIM from Straight Talk in and it instantly worked. Twice the LTE speed that I got on my S7, more bands available to the S10+ I bet.Overall am I happy with the purchase? If you gave me a brand new one and then this one, the only difference would be some very, very light and tiny scratches on the screen, only seen with the screen off and directly in the light. Is that worth 300$? Absolutely! I'm amazed it's actually this good and refurbished. Totally satisfied.",2020年4月19日 在美国审核

"My Experience, Very Good!","I was hesitant on getting this, because I see all the reviews that have 1 star, 2 stars, saying their SIM Cards don't work, and the screen came cracked, and that it doesn't work right or isn't what they ordered. My experience, I got exactly what I ordered. I ordered a Black Samsung Galaxy S10+ Unlocked with 128GB of Internal Memory, and that is exactly what I got! It is an official Samsung Galaxy S10+ (NOT a Chinese knockoff, or a really convincing fake) and it works perfectly fine with my T-Mobile SIM Card, and everything works great (LTE, Calling/Texting, Wi-Fi Calling). All of the buttons work fine, my screen had no scratches or cracks (looked brand new), Fingerprint reader works perfectly (for me it works 98% of the time) and the screen looks amazing.I cannot personally guarantee that you will have the same experience if you order this product, but I can tell you, the product I received is a Genuine S10+, has the same specs as is listed in the title/description, and it works exactly the way the phone is supposed to (which to me, it works amazingly)",2019年11月28日 在美国审核

Fingerprint reader works great, but I find it a tad bit slower than the ones on the back, but I believe it's due to the technology of being integrated in the screen.Only weird thing I found is that sometimes when I try to listen to a Whatsapp audio on my ear it takes a bit of time to switch to the ear speaker and it keeps playing full volume. Not sure if that is a software or hardware issue, but nothing I can't live with.Overall I'm extremely satisfied for saving so much money and basically getting the same phone.PD: Honest review, wasn't paid or even asked to write a review on the phone. The company never contacted me for any follow-up after purchase.",2020年5月27日 在美国审核
Love the device,"I did my reviews on the device and I am pleased with performance.It is very similar and carried over all of my apps and almost all of my passwords.

"When they say unlocked they mean global whitelist,  price may mean it's us blacklisted","I thought this could possibly be too good to be true. Well, for a while it was as good as the price. But it was a blacklisted phone, a Verizon unpaid. I was on metropcs and had no issues but all major carriers here will not allow it. So not as advertised,but hey the phone was in decent condition. Returning this and going to Verizon to buy a new one outright, as should you if metro or boost isn't your cup of tea.",2019年10月10日 在美国审核
"Functional, Fast, and Accurate","I'm unsure what went wrong with some of the other reviews I've seen with complaints, but The item (S10+) arrived exactly as described in a plain box containing the phone, a charger, and a cable. Battery life seems to be just as it should be and while I was told there would be some minor blemishes, I honestly can't find them. Phone is legitimately unlocked, so setup consisted of putting in the SIM card and turning it on. Price was great and storage is ample. Basically, I got exactly what I asked for and it showed up a day earlier than advertised. Can't really complain about that.Item sold to me by ElectroWireless and I would recommend them to anyone",2021年8月9日 在美国审核
Samsung Renewed Galaxy S10 plus on Metro PCS,"The phone arrived a day early. No visible damage. I activated the phone thru Metro PCS service and it seemed liked everything worked great on the phone and I was able to use all of my apps. The signal kept dropping after a few minutes. After calling Metro and troubleshooting 3 times and bringing it to a store to have them test another sim card, it still didn't work. So I had to return it after keeping it for 2-3 days. I would gladly take a chance on another renewed phone. It could have been an issue with the internal antenna. The phone arrived at the shipper today and I'll see how long the refund process takes. No issues with the seller. 5/22 update: The seller acknowledged my return and processed my refund which takes about 2-3 business days. I would certainly purchase from this seller again, even though the phone didn't work for me. Rob from Chicago, IL",2020年5月20日 在美国审核

Hit or miss,Bought two phones from this seller for gifts.First one came packed in a protective casing. It had no visible scratches or defects. However the second phone came in a thin plastic wrap that provided no protection for shipping whatsoever. It also had many scruffs on the sides of the phone. This phone also Started overheating the moment we turned it on. On top of that there was so much dust built up in the charging port and mic jack that the charger would not insert easily.Giving this review a 3 star till I receive my refund then i will bump it up if there are no issues with the returns. I will also update if the first phone has any issues that were not seen right away****Update****Refund was issued in a professional manner. If I dont have any other issues with the first phone I will definitely buy again!,2020年12月7日 在美国审核

Great phone,The phone arrived in almost perfect condition and works smoothly. The battery life is pretty impressive for an avid user. Comes with generic charger and USB so I used my own samsung one.

Works With Verzion,"In the listing for the Variant ""Samsung Galaxy S10+, 128GB, Prism Blue - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)"" it says it does not work with Verizon, but I did research on the model number of the S10 plus and it said it worked.

Like New! Better than expected!```,I have combed over the reviews for this seller/phone and decided to try my luck and buy a phone. I messaged the seller prior to purchase to ask if this phone would work on my Verizon prepaid account. The seller was prompt with a response and ensured me it would work fine. The phone came in the original S10+ box but the charger was not original. I did not receive any headphones but I'm ok with that. The phone did come with the sim card key which was great. The phone itself was in immaculate condition. it pretty much looks brand new! I put my sim card and 128G SD card in and everything worked perfectly with no issues. All my photos and apps ported over seamlessly. I'm upgrading form another Galaxy phn and I am very pleased with this phne! it crystal clear and takes great pics!,2020年7月13日 在美国审核

I ordered my phone on the 8th it arrived on the 11th...WAS scheduled to arrive between the 16th and the 24th. The only thing I did want was a blue, green or purple phone...but like I told my husband it doesn't matter that much because I'm getting a purple wallet case anyway!

Like a new phone,"UPDATE 2. Bought another S10+ from""Synergy"" as an Amazon Renewed. Went over it with a magnifying glass and could not find one scratch. I ran several battery tests that tested between 97% and 99% battery health. Synergy tested it at 98% and placed that information on the Box label. I'm getting approximately 2 days battery use after charging to 85% and recharging charging at approximately 20%. I've tested the phone microphone which was the reason for the return and it has been perfect. People I called or called me couldn'thear or understand me after about 1 minute. No problem even after several 2 hour Whatsapp calls to Brazil and numerous calls locally. Problem solved. Also very fast free shipping. SYNERGY,I'll do business with you again.UPDATE!! Returned the phone today. After around 1 minute of calling someone, they couldn't understand what I was saying. Happened on local calls, distance calls, Whatsapp and Messenger. Att had no solution. Mictest app showed very low voice levels but when put it on speaker phone people could hear me fine and Mictest levels were fine. On the positive side Amazon Return went perfect, basically no questions asked which I found strange. You'd think the seller would want to know what to fix. Oh well. I'll try one more time. I really like the phone. Blazing fast from what I'm used to and updated to Android 12.This is like a new phone except for the battery. Per Accubattery after 8 charges it has a device capacity of 81%. This is within Amazons requirement that it be no lower than 80%. It started at 55% then 53% then came up charge after charge to 81%. Took it to Phone Doctor for 59.99 battery replacement but am still happy with the purchase.",2022年2月7日 在美国审核

RE-CELL- BEST.CUSTOMER.SERVICE.EVER!,"Quick version:Phone condition is Like New. Seller, RE-CELL, is exemplary and quick to reply.Long version:Received phone with 2-day shipping and was near perfect except for what looked like a small smudge below the screen cameras. (Picture 1). Barely visible unless the light hit it at a certain angle. Because it was the screen I contacted the seller to see if this was normal. He apologized saying it was not acceptable and to return it and he’ll send another out and included a rebate for my inconvenience. He didn’t have another white, but a black. Thinking about the black, and looking at images, I was getting to think I might like the black better than the white. He contacted me saying he received a white one. I told him I’d rather have the black he had instead. He said it was sold, but he’ll source another black one for me. Which he did. Same day. At that point I realized he sourced a white one for me, and then a black one. Geesh. He sent the 2nd phone out once the return package was sent. So free return shipping, his exchange was sent FedEx 2-day to get it to me asap. He included a small wireless charger. Email responses were prompt.Phone looked Like New (Pictures 2-4). The seller checked that it would accept my carrier out of the box. And it did. I checked with CPU-Z app and verified this was the better regarded Snapdragon (7mm, USA/China), not the Exynos (8mm, International) that should sell at a lower price-point. After 2+ weeks with the phone the only way I can tell this was a used phone is the battery. Everything is working perfectly. I’ve just started checking the battery with 2 apps, but they differ. One is just above the Amazon 80+% at 81% (AccuBattery), the other is showing 71% (Battery Guru). More charges are needed to be more accurate, and AccuBattery is highly rated and reviewed. Nonetheless, way more than enough battery capacity to last me a day and still have 30-40% left, and the phone is 2 years old. So there's that.In short, anxiety about buying a used phone, especially if problems arise, are a non-issue with this seller, RE-CELL. I will be searching out this seller for the next phone for anyone in my family.I was very pleasantly surprised with their customer service and can recommend RE-CELL without reservation.",2021年12月6日 在美国审核

S10+ from Verizon using on Consumer Cellular (which uses ATT network),"OK. This was purchased from ""Prime W"". It was advertised as ""For AT&amp;T"" - so you can imagine my head just about blew up when I powered it up and the Verizon logo popped up. (Verizon phones are generally CDMA phones and AT&amp;T are generally GSM phones), since the description of the phone did not indicate this phone had a dual SIM capability, I assumed I was going to have to go through the return process to get a phone that would be compatible with Consumer Cellular's AT&amp;T network requirement. Lo and behold - the phone was compatible with Consumer Cellular. Usually, kismet in my favor in these matters is not in my favor. This time, God's finger reached down and touched me.The phone itself came in pristine condition. Only a consideration when you're buying a ""renewed"" phone. Prime W not only included a genuine Samsung fast charger, but they also put a cellophane static cling screen protector for shipping on AND shrink wrapped the phone. Good on you Prime W. The charging port appeared unused - usually a good indicator of how the phone was used by the previous owner. For all intents and purposes, this was a new phone - which is important because the phone is now my wife's.The only issue I've encountered is the inability to remove a phone alert that I've inserted a non-Verizon SI"" card into the phone. With this phone, I spent some time with Consumer Cellular's customer service department, but after some nudging they were able to get it in service.The phone immediately updated to Android 11 and the most recent Google security patches. The Samsung Smart Switch accommodated the transfer of files from her S7 and Google did the rest. Since my wife never deletes anything - I added an additional 128G SD card and she's off and running.Samsung's S10+ is the same phone as the S10 except the screen is .3"" larger than my S10 but I didn't find it unwieldy - and she likes the larger screen, but it's not like some of these phones where you find yourself suddenly carrying a ""notebook"" around. Women carry their phones in purses -- men generally in their pocket. So, for her it's the cat's 'jammies.As with any phone that you're using out of the original network, it came jammed with Verizon bloatware which can't be removed but can be deactivated. It'll just sit there wasting memory but by-and-large isn't an issue. Many apps can be moved and stored on the SD card freeing up phone resources - unfortunately useless Google and Verizon proprietary software are largely permanent squatters on your phone.Plus, this phone is compatible with all of my wireless Anker chargers so that's nice - but the Samsung fast charger wall plug adapter is really quite impressive. Just saying.I'm not a ""Samsung guy"" because I got used to and spoiled by LG until they decided to get out of the phone business and I had to switch phones to get on to Consumer Cellular but this phone, like my S10 is really something. The cameras are vastly superior - I mean, the difference between these phones and my old LG is the difference between lightning and lightning bug - not even a close comparison.On the same note, the audio is just kinda ... WOW! Understand that I'm not a kid, I'm a tail-end boomer and proud of it, when I'm listening to my music or watching video, I'm not using buds ... I'm using full blown Bose noise blocking headphones. I've got to say that I didn't know what I was missing all these years. Really quite impressive.Now understand that this phone does have a 3.5 headphone plug which is nice ... but it also has a dedicated Bixby button right below the volume buttons on the left - so even deactivated, Bixby will be a recurring irritant ... like a bad, bad laxative. Come on Samsung ... dump that P.O.S. :o)Anyway, very, very nice phone - props to Prime W -- for a bunch of ""East Coasters"", you folks are aces in my book.",2021年10月9日 在美国审核

Looks and works like brand new!,"Received the phone and charger professionally packaged. I unpacked expecting to see maybe a scratch or 2 but to my surprise this phone is flawless!! I wouldn't have expected anything less if it were brand new. I purchased the unlocked phone that was previously a Verizon phone since I have service with Verizon.I was told I could just take the sim card from. My old phone and place it in theis one but when I did my sim was not recognized. Verizon was closed so I proceeded to transfer my info from. My old phone to this one. After a few taps and some added info all my stuff wirelessly transfered with not so much as a hiccup! Wow! Something works like they say it does!! The next morning I took the phone to Verizon and they installed a new sim and I was up and running!! The only negative I see is how out-of-date the android system is. This thing has been prompting me to install updates for 3 days now.I called Samsung and they said if the phone hasn't been updated in a while then yeah, there have been a lot of improvements to Android over the last 2 years. Normally an up-to-date phone will update in the background when you're sleeping or the phone is on idle unless you have turned it off and you can only do that while in developer mode. All I really heard was blah blah blah update, blah blah blah, developer mode.. so I will let it do what it has to do.All in all I couldn't be happier with this purchase and will definitely pass along my positive experiences to anyone who may be looking for a replacement phone!

"Not bad, not amazing but worth my money","So I broke the screen on my original s10+ and it was cheaper to just buy a refurbished phone the take to a repair shop...However the fastest network for this ""S10+"" is H+.... how? 4G was the lowest speed I get on my cracked phone.Yet... the phone is other wise upgraded software wise??I'm so confused.But happy confused I guess... I live in a 5g area so its not my network provoder and I own a private booster it still won't go over a 3g connection.Othe minor annoyances:The back camera screen was cracked, but you can't tell with gorilla glass on it.The charger they sent with this phone nearly melted and wouldn't charge the phone it was spazzing out going from charging to not charging for a good 5 mins.Luckily it didn't damage the phone which charged just fine on a real Samsung cable afterwards.Lastly it didn't come with the Sim tool like stated, I had to find the one from my old phone (not a big deal).",2021年6月3日 在美国审核

This is NOT a completely unlocked phone,"When you check the phone settings, it will tell you it's a SM-G975U1, which is a completely unlocked phone.That's not the case.I use my phone with Ting, which now has 3 possible service providers:Sprint, T-mobile, and now Verizon.This phone is NOT compatible with Sprint.If you upgrade the phone to Android 10 (or it comes pre-installed), this phone is also NOT compatible with Verizon.There is some incompatibility between Verizon and the Samsung Android 10 implementation that doesn't allow any data connection to work.I can only assume the two companies are pointing their fingers at each other, because there's no ETA for a fix.So the only option is to prevent the phone from upgrading to Android 10 somehow, or downgrade to Android 9 using a process that could possibly brick the phone.In other words:DO NOT BUY!",2020年3月4日 在美国审核

It's an older 'renewed' phone ... can't expect perfect,"Don't care much for Samsungs phones.Too much bloatware &amp; other shhhtuff from service providers.But we needed a Samsung as it was the only brand that will work on the secure system we have to work with.The price of a newer S20 or a new S21 is astronomical.My justification for a renewed S10+ ... I can buy two of these for price of a new one &amp; still save money.Researching the seller is the trick.I needed a seller that would sell me a 'truly' unlocked phone &amp; not a wannabe that is more trouble than necessary.Hybrid IT was one of the only sellers I could find with a rating high enough to feel comfortable with; 98% in the last 12 months.The phone is truly unlocked &amp; everything is working great.There was a slight blemish on one side of the screen I discovered when putting on a screen protector.With the screen protector on the phone, you can't see any blemishes at all.It looks beautiful.The phone was wiped &amp; reset to its factory settings &amp; immediately wanted to update the moment it was connected to a wifi.Initially the S10+ came with Android v9 Pie but after the firmware update it was running v11.I needed v9 or better &amp; didn't want to take the chance with an older phone not updating so the S10+ was a 'bottom of the list' pick for me.Being a 'renewed' phone, the page (Amazon) does warn you of the ""possible"" generic packaging &amp; charger &amp; I expected as much.What I didn't expect &amp; found funny &amp; a touch disappointing was the Lightning charger cable included in the packaging.Samsung S10+ requires a USB-C charger cable, not an Apple Lightning charger cable.The two are completely incompatible.The charger itself is a true generic that has specifications with the S10's necessities so I just need to invest in a USB-C cable.You'd think a seller with a high rating would have enough pride to check their packages before shipping.Perhaps they have a new 17 year old packager who doesn't know the difference ... oh well, like I mentioned earlier, it was funny to find the Lightning cable in the package.",2021年6月16日 在美国审核

Everything I wanted and a grey price,"Was pushed to upgrade by my carrier (AT&amp;T) making network changes.I wanted a reliable fingerprint reader and my wife had the S10+ and loves hers so I pulled the trigger since the price point was VERY attractive.I am finding this phone has plenty of space for apps and performance is snappy.The 5G download speed is outstanding as well. I have been most pleasantly surprised by the 'all day and ilate nto the night"" battery life.When I do run the battery down I'm getting lightning fast recharge with the adaptive fast charging.To be honest, I was dubious about the claims but the night my dog tangled the cords over night and I woke up to less than 10%charge and got to over 60% by the time I finished mycommute less than an hour later.I might note that 60% battery will see me through the workday and my adaptive charger for the car was worth every penny.Other items of note:Graphics are excellent.The camera has done everything I asked it to do including a pretty nice job with low light conditions.Speakers have good volume and passable sound but you will be glad for earbuds if you take your music listening seriously.I might be coming off as a fan-boy, but closer to the.

Screen protectors are factory-fixed in some brands like Vivo and Oppo across all models (which is really useful). I wish Samsung followed it. Aftermarket protectors don't fit properly on the curved Samsung flagship front screens.Also, dual band GPS is available for accurate navigation in Xiomi, one plus flagships which is absent in Samsung flagship models. Hopefully Samsung improves.The camera modules, too, have not seen improvement and remain stagnant. They are the same sized sensors for s9, note9, etc. Other brands upgraded to 1/1.7"" and 1/2"" sensors. Every next model shows improvement in optics and sensors.

"They are lying. It's not renewed, it's unlocked and now doesn't work!","Bought three of these phones. One didn't work and was sent back immediately. Five months later one of the phone's ""calling and receiving calls"" function stops working. I tried having my phone repair service fix it and they tell me it's a phone service issue. I take it to AT&amp;T and they tell me that with the recent upgrade to their cell phone towers that phones that are ""Unlocked"" rather than ""Renewed"" will stop working. They then take a look at the model numbers of the two phones and tell me that they are both unlocked phones and that the phone that is still working will stop working soon as well. Because it's past the return date both the seller and Amazon refuse to refund me for the phones even though they were fraudulently sold as ""Renewed"" when actually they were ""Unlocked."" So I'm out $646.02. Very disappointed that Amazon let's a third party seller get away with fraud and that Amazon didn't have my back. My advice is now what the AT&amp;T rep told me. ""Don't buy a phone from Amazon, because you never really know what you will get."" And let me add there's a pretty good chance you will get screwed.",2022年4月8日 在美国审核

"Not Fake, it's factory unlocked. (Green one I bought)","This is not fake. It took me on we 2 months to finally purchase because I was so scared. Read the reviews about this phone and they were mostly positive. The company also had good ratings but I was still sceptical because of the bad reviews.<br>Firstly, my phone arrived early. And it saved me the trouble of doing without a phone for couple days as my s6 started shutting off.Secondly, the phone was in pretty good condition. I only saw a small crack on the back which is minor.Thirdly, the phone is unlocked. I used T-Mobile and my SIM works works perfectly. It was easy to do smart switch so the phone was up and running. It came in a box, and had a charger. It had a booklet that gives info about contacting your network provider.Fourth, I AM LOVING IT. battery life is good. When it first came I charged it which you should do with every new phone. It did not take forever to charge.</br>",2019年12月4日 在美国审核

"""Renewed"" means ""Used"" pre-owned phone.","I got this 512GB s10+ one day ago.Happy: The phone are well packaged, and the seller, ""Pro Wireless"", use sealed plastic bag for all items.The items include wired AKG ear buds (thanks for seller's kindness), charger, type-c cable, usb 3 female to type-c adapter, and type-c to type-c adapter.Fireware model is G975USQS2ASGB.After a short setup, it seems it is full functional phone and worked out with AT&amp;T as well.I did not see any problem with battery. It comes with around 50%. It can be charged to 100%.I did not test how long it will last in the run.Not so good:There are one small screen crack on the left corner. Since it is very small, it does not impact screen function.There are one significant scratch and many obvious scratch on the screen. All of them do not impact screen function as well.I believe ex-owner did not use screen protector and case to protect this expensive baby. That's why the price costs $200+ less than a new one.Regards to features and specification of S10+, I am ok with it, but I feel the price is bit of high. High end cell phone price was pushed into $1000+ and all functions aimed to be the replacement and invasion of personal life. Only history in the future can say.",2019年12月9日 在美国审核

Unlocked and worked with my service provider,"I was nervous about ordering this phone, because of it's of reviews saying that it arrived locked. This was not the case for me. Overall the phone seems great.I havefew things that are really irritating me. I miss the easy gestures my Motorola has to access the flashlight and camera. I have medium sized hand (for a woman) and I'm finding lots of issues with this, even with my Popsocket installed. I have to stretch to reach the fingerprint sensor.This is more complex technology, but a downgrade from using a place your finger naturally touches when holding the phone. Also, the senor does not work with the screen protector that I bought.Reaching the main 3 bottom buttons are uncomfortable to reach, especially on the bottom right (I'm right handed). I'm hoping that this could be fixed with a system update. I find all the side buttons hard to reach also. When phones were smaller having the high buttons was fine, but now I have to use two hands to press a button. This phone doesn't even appear huge to me.Ergonomics were not carefully thought through. The comfort of navigating and holding my phone is huge to me.",2019年11月2日 在美国审核

A bit more scratch up than I would have liked,This review is for the Samsung Galaxy S10+. Received a day early. Plain white box with new charger and cord. No directions but didn't need or expect any. The phone is scratch up a bit more than advertised but with a case and screen protector you can't see them. The phone only has 79% battery life as mesaure with a battery app called AccuBattery (Am sure there are other apps that measure the same) after 3-full 100% to 0% charges.Over all am happy with the phone (Awesome Phone and camera) and not worth returning since case hides the faults and 1% less battery life than advertised is not worth the effort. I'm sure there are better phones but for $224.00 it was worth it.,2022年4月1日 在美国审核

Had I been proficient enough it would have been unlocked in 15-30 minutes. It cost $60 or $90, but well worth it. I'll try to find the name of the company I used. The phone works great now with the exception of when I put my SD card in, the phone won't work. I'm going to try to put the SIM card back in the old one and slide it into my new phone, hoping that there's just something wrong with the tray they sit in.",2021年10月17日 在美国审核

"Great value, great phone.","I was wondering what phone to get for a few months now since my old phone wasn't working the way it should. I eventually decided the Samsung galaxy s10+ provided me with all the things I want in a phone 8GB ram, headphone Jack, great cameras, great speaker and current android. I was a little worried about buying this phone renewed considering it's been a year since the phone was released. Also, I never bought a renewed phone. So I was very afraid to receive it and I also had already received the accessories I bought for this phone so if I didn't like it I would have spent too much money on something Ididn't like. When I received my phone yesterday I was surprised to how new it looked and it had the screen protectors both on the front and back of the phone. The front screen protector seemed to have a hole and a scratch though but I bought one so I didn't mind replacing it. The phone came with a charger and the cable unfortunately it did not include the pin to open the sim card and sd card tray. Luckily I saved the pin from my leg phone.1. I love how there wasn't that much bloat wear on it.2. Download Accubattery the moment you receive it as I had found out after purchasing that Amazon Amazon renewed phone have at least 80% battery capacity. Accubattery will tell you how much battery capacity is on your phone, min ranged from 95-97% on 2 phone charges since I received it yesterday.3. I easily transferred files by downloading Smart Switch in my old phone. It is already included on Samsung phones. I did the wireless transfers. You will need to backup WhatsApp and WeChat if you use those as you will have to transfer it through those apps and not on Smart Switch. Smart Switch comes in handy for anyone who likes having old text messages transferred over.4. Make sure you have a pin to open the sd card | sim card tray.5. Fingerprint sensor is ok. It works 95% of the time for me.Overall definitely have not been disappointed with my purchase so far and I know it's been a day but if anything comes up, I'll update on here.-update:Just realized my phone software is Verizon, not tmobile however it still works but can't tell if I'm getting software updates since apparently there is a March 13 update but I have yet to receive it despite clicking updates on my phone.",2020年3月12日 在美国审核

EXCELLENT PHONE,"COMPANY: OM-WIRELESSITEM: Samsung Galaxy S10+, 1TB, Ceramic Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed)MODEL: SM-G975U1My Item came in the original box, with the original paperwork, with the original charger and a USB C power cord.

This was better than I expected, so I was well pleased.This ""Fully Unlocked"" phone was easy to set up with my phone carrier and I have used it for two weeks and it seems flawless.Be sure to do your homework, to make sure that the phone you buy is a match for you, as the company (OM-WIRELESS) isn't very knowledgeable at answering questions, and they are not very quick to respond, so do your homework, (I took off 1 star because of poor communication).That said, again, the item looks and seems flawless !!(and I am very, very happy with it so far)I would buy from this seller again, (provided I didn't have to ask them any questions, as they don't seem to be very knowledgeable).",2021年10月17日 在美国审核

I ordered one of these back in October, the phone itself was in great condition, no scratches, looked brand new, however... the camera was damaged and had a spec on every picture I took. I asked for a replacement but instead I was refunded my money and the price increased by $70 the next day. I've waited MONTHS for the price to drop again so I can reorder.. well it finally did but once again I was sent an even worse phone. The charging port was FULL of lint, the phone itself showed a warning sign when charging and the screen is full of scratches.guess I'll take another refund and order from someone else.",2021年7月11日 在美国审核

Look at the sellers! Not all phones are correctly listed as your carrier,"First of, let me point out that every one of these renewed phones comes from a different seller that is NOT Amazon, so people's experiences are based off of individual sellers and not Amazon.This is my second renewed phone from Ana Amazon Seller and it works great BUT it won't text. When the description says ""fully unlocked,"" that doesn't mean factory unlocked. The first phone I got was for AT&amp;T/Tmobile but it was still locked to Tmobile and wouldn't work. This second phone works on my network and everything, but something is delayed or stopping my texts on occasion. I've been on the phone with AT&amp;T everyday for a week but still no fix. The phone was previously locked to Sprint and looks like has some sort of issue with the AT&amp;T network.The phone is perfect with no scratches or damage. Powered on without an issue. Set up was fine.But if you get this phone, don't spend your entire day setting up. Put your sim card in FIRST andmake sure IT WORKS. I spent hours setting up my first phone only for the sim not to work. This second phone worked as soon as I put the sim card in but the texting issue is sporadic and you couldn't tell there was an issue until your texts fail to send or you get a pile of texts half an hour after they were sent.As for replacements from the sellers, you need to do a return, wait for them to approve it, then you have to pay return shipping. They will not send you a replacement, you need to do another purchase. Because of that, my Amazon credit card bill sky rocketed and it takes them weeks to process the return to put the money back into my account. If I need to return the second phone bwchzwe AT&amp;T can't fix the texting, then I will need to purchase A THIRD phone and put another $500 on my account until the other returns are processed. Message the sellers before purchase if you can.",2020年6月26日 在美国审核

Good phone that I'm still getting used to.,"Upgraded from MOTO G7 Power and here's my take. The Moto has a bigger battery but this one is doing fine.

Camera was one of my main reasons for choosing S10.The S10 has lots more memory 512 vs 64 and 8 vs 4 gb ram.I struggle more to open this phone, but once in it rewards with power and functionality.All in all a good buy.Received in like new condition without any micro scratches.

Beautiful phone,"I returned this phone because of a couple glitches and shaky video. After going through three other Samsung phones since, I'm realizing that the two glitches (at least one of them anyway), aren't glitches after all. Apparently, Samsung built these ""glitches"" into their new phones. One widget ""glitch"" is with the weather widget. Before this OS change, when you have the weather widget on the home screen, you swipe down slightly on the widget and the city changes. I could swipe through 10 cities in 10-seconds. It doesn't do that anymore. Now, if you want to look at 10 different cities, give yourself a few minutes. This is a big deal to me because I change cities often. Now we have to tap the widget - go to settings - change the city - go back to the home screen, and then do that process all over again to go another city. A 1-second swap is now a 20-second swap.The battery life is top notch, phone looks beautiful, and it's extremely fast.",2020年8月30日 在美国审核

No problems with this Renewed S10+,"I was a little nervous about the ""renewed"" (vs. refurbished) concept. But I didn't want to spend $800-$1000 for a ""new"" phone. Spoke with a friend who is a cell phone reseller on the side and he assured me it would be fine. And it has been for two weeks. No scratches or any other noticeable ""pre-owned"" issues.We wanted unlocked phones as we were leaving Boost Mobile [with the other droves] and like to use our phones overseas when we vacation by simply buying Vodaphone [or other providers] sim cards so we can use Google Maps, texting etc.So this will check all the boxes.We switched over to T-Mobile and just had them pop in the sim card, added our SD expansion card from my wife's other phone and bada-bing it worked flawlessly and my wife reports zero issues.The only very minor thing is there was NO MANUAL. Of course, today most of us are all pretty tech savy with our phones and they are so intuitive that really has not been an issue. Especially since we have been Samsung Galaxy users for about 6 years this wasn't a big deal. I only mention that IF YOU NEED A MANUAL.

Permanent Screen Protector or Liquid Glass added to Screen - take note,"Pros: Quick Arrival, body of phone in great condition, screen initially looked good, great battery life.Cons: Permanent Screen Protector (I believe liquid glass), no fingerprint recognition, occasional touchscreen sensitivity or delay, wireless charging issuesThe long of it:This was probably my fault for not reading carefully enough or not really understanding what liquid glass is, since I've never used it.I cannot get the phone to read my fingerprint or wireless charge which I think is due to the ""permanent screen protector"".At least my online forum reading has lead me to this conclusion.I've never had these issues before and I've never had a phone with this kind of screen protector. Additionally, when putting my phone case on, I pushed hard on the top corner and the screen protector cracked.Not the screen.Just the hard plastic-ish screen protector.The screen is actually un-cracked but now the screen protector is peeling back further and further a tiny little bit at a time.I mean tiny and I have to pick away little pieces and it appears as though there is now a long crack on the upper left corner but, again, the actual screen is fine underneath but everything I can find is telling me there is no 'safe' way to remove this kind of screen protector so I'll just deal with it. However, knowing what I know now, I would not recommend using this kind of screen protector.The screen looks cracked and the phone repair place said they would charge me for a full screen replacement since they cannot remove the protector so it doesn't feel like it protected anything because it 'cracked' so easily while putting on a phone protection case.No service problems with the actual company.",2021年2月9日 在美国审核

"Better to buy New than ""Renewed"" from these guys","I gave the seller a second chance at trading out the previous device they mailed me.

Its probably the same adhesive that made the forst device they shipped me lose its back glass. The seller said they would check it but this seems like a case of ""Good Enough ♂""<br>Below was my review for the original device the seller mailed as ""Renewed""----------After owning a Galaxy s8 for several years now, I decided it was time for an upgrade.Waited eagerly for this phone to arrive, and today was the day. I open it up pop my SIM card in and connected it. At first I thought I felt the backpiece wigglin but I figured it was just my hands getting used to a bigger phone. Not even 3 hours into owning this device, the back piece came completely off. I took the chance to compare it to an iFixIt video and I can tell there are screws missing and the wireless charging piece was put on crooked. Very poor use of ""Renewed.""

So the phone was suddenly an expensive brick that we have to go through the hassle of factory resetting and packaging and mailing back to the seller, finding a replacement phone and waiting for that to come to try this all again....

But since I don't have sprint, the update fails and uses mobile data.I also can not make MMS messages or receive them. After 4 hours on the phone with my carrier. They placed the blame on Samsung not releasing a patch for unlocked phones to send MMS messages. Which, by law. They are required to allow the full unlocking of phones.Beside these problems. I really love the quality of the phone itself. It was a major upgrade for me, as I had a Galaxy J7 Crown.The camera is amazing. The video is equally amazing.

GRANTED I was expecting this with used Samsung phones, BUT the price should be less than what i paid for (~$300) if this is what I'm getting. I will be testing out the battery in different uses (games, drones, ect), but currently the battery drops 2% in 3 hrs not used and not connected to wifi/cellular. I get about 6% battery use per continual filming of 15 mins at 1080p 30 fps. and about 1% battery use for 5-8 mins of normal use, but I will update once I completed testing it.I will also add photos at a later time, and will update connectivity/unlocked status once I connect to a mobile service provider.I got this purely for the camera and to use for drone flying, so I'm not fretting to much. But if you are planning on buying as your standalone day to day cell, I would implore you to invest a little more on a new unit due to the battery.

However, even after AT&amp;T transferring everything from my old cell to this new cell, I had no voicemail, even though, after checking my apps, themselves, it says my visual voicemail had also been transferred to the new cell, but, I have no way of getting voice mail. It tells me to dial *86, but, I get a recording that says it's not the correct number. I've tried installing different apps, but then it asks for my Samsung password, which I can't remember. When I try to reset it, I get a message that sounds like I'm going to have to reset my entire phone, and possibly lose everything that's on there, so, I'm afraid to take the chance. Good thing, is, that my SIM card from my old cell works in this one. I didn't need a new one of them, since I didn't even get one of them with this new phone. Nor did I get any kind of instructions with the new cell. So, what I did, was, put SIM card back in my old cell, looked up the voicemail number to call to get voicemail, then put that in my contact list on the new cell. So, I can get voicemail by actually dialing that number.Next, I've tried to pay my online credit card through the app on the cell. But, that also has to be all reset. That's when I get a message that says they're texting me 6 digit code that I have to send to them to confirm it's really me. However, the text never comes through. I've tried different things, with no luck. Now, I'm not saying every renewed cell will have these problems... it might just be mine, or just an isolated incident. But, I will probably be sending it back. Next time I'll just buy a brand new cell... possibly an S20.B Andrews",2021年8月28日 在美国审核
The company that refurbs these did something that blew my mind,"When I first received the refurbed phone it looked good, until I turned it on... Once I turned it on I noticed there was a weird circle in the middle lower section of the screen. You could see through the circle but the circle was so noticeable it was distracting. I decided Id mess with it a bit and see if i could get used to it but shortly after that I encountered an additional problem. There were a couple of keys on the on screen keyboard that mis-clicked a lot. I decided to take the tempered glass screen protector off that the refurb company had put on there to see if that was the cause of the issue thinking if thats all it was I just order a new screen protector and be done with it. Well to my amazement when I went to remove the screen protector I found out what that circle was in the middle of the screen. IT WAS GLUE! THEY GLUED THE GLASS SCREEN PROTECTOR ON TO THE SCREEN! Which meant not only did it produce that annoying circle but also meant that if you ever broke the screen protector youd be unable to pull it off and replace it. Not only that but once I removed all of the screen protector except the circle that the glue was holding in place I tested the 2 keys out that werent working right again and low and behold they worked just fine once they were uncovered. Im convinced it was the fact that the protector was glued on that caused all these issues because after returning this refurb I went to new egg and bought another refurb phone just like this not realizing it was from the same refurbishing company. YUP!, you guessed it It had the same crappy circle of glue in the middle of the screen and while I had a bit of a different issue with the glued on screen protector interfering with proper screen performance it was still causing problems none the less. Why this company would do this is beyond me, Ive seen some dumb things in my time but this one is definitely in the top 5.",2020年12月25日 在美国审核
Not off to a good start…UPDATED,"UPDATE: I have had the phone a few weeks now and it works fine with a good lasting battery charge. Other than the screen being scratched up, it is worth it to just keep it at this point. To be fair, switched rating from 1 star to 3 stars because it works.I don’t know how this phone functions yet, as I just got it today and opened the box and I’m already very disappointed! The front of this phone is VERY scratched and looks like it’s been thrown around quite a bit. I have owned several phones for years at a time and none of them got scratches on the display! This is ridiculous. The phone wasn’t charged, so I have it on a charger now. I may try to see how it performs but do not want to go through with the whole set up if it functions as bad as the screen looks. If I decide to keep it and it runs good/great, I may come back to change my review, but as of now and the way it looks for almost $300 after “taxes”, it’s not looking too promising. ",2022年2月8日 在美国审核

"Definitely a reconditioned with a new screen, but not the best...","I took a chance with this one. It arrived in a generic box with the charger and cable (generic). Once I took it out, the screen looked new, but immediately noticed a 'ripple' effect on the screen. Clearly it has been replaced, which I dont mind, but it was not the best job. It was a glass 'gel replacement' which is how they fix the screen inexpensively. When held against the light in an angle, you get a waterdrop effect.. The back was original, and had acceptable light scratches, nothing crazy. Phone operates fine, sound is good, and once you turn it on, you cannot notice the ripple effect, so I decided to keep it for this reason. It leaves me wondering though about the IP68 rating - is it still valid for 30 mins under water? I would prob not risk it considering the screen was replaced. For the price, I would have expected a 'used' phone in very good condition. If the screen was replaced, I would have expected OEM parts or a new digitizer altogether. I honestly would not pay more than three hundred for this phone, but since I already have it. I will keep it.",2021年3月11日 在美国审核

The build quality is also premium with glass and metal. The screen is amazingly beautiful. This is Samsung's best phone on the market. Period.Finally, about the renewed phone condition...Mine appeared to have never been used. Not a single scratch. It was still on Android 10. It even had the original screen protector.It was a Verizon unlocked phone. It changed to T mobile when I put in my Sim. I updated to the latest version of Android.The only drawback was that sitting around idle had made the phone battery degrade to 87 percent health.

NEVER WORKED PROPERLY,"This is a review of the Samsung Galaxy s10 plus, blue... sold by Chubbie. The item arrived perfectly packaged. That's the 1 star. The phone never worked properly. I could never get service even though I had service. So, no phone calls or text messages in or out. And, no internet. The phone would occasionally work inside the house and occasionally (2 mins here or there) inside the cellphone store. I spent over 6 hours at 2 different stores (just in case the person at my original store wasn't a techie) having them try and get service on this phone. 2 new sim cards, verifying apn, setting up a new apn, confirming the phone was compatible with my carrier, resetting the service on the phone itself, resetting multiple settings inside the phone and even so far as to factory reset the phone. It never worked. It had service the entire time, but NEVER worked. What good is a phone that can not call out or receive calls? Do we still have bricks in 2021? I won't even get into the fact that it couldn't even get the text verification in the store to even authorize my account. I had my carrier print out the entirety of everything done to get this phone to work and it never did. The battery also lost charge very quickly even when not in use... BECAUSE IT NEVER WORKED.",2021年7月21日 在美国审核

Would have been an ideal cell phone if it had come unlocked!,"I love the beauty of this Samsung S10plus so I was disheartened after spending hours trying to get it to work to learn that the APN’s were locked down preventing me from activating it. The phone was in good condition with 381 battery cycles used yet the company called KISS did not send me a FULLY UNLOCKED phone as described at Amazon. So disappointed and can’t trust to reorder from them worried I’d get the same thing.Amazon stood behind their renewed warranty and I reordered from another company and the phone came unlocked with only 8 cycles used on the battery. So after incredible frustration trying to get the first one to recognize my sim card in the long run I ended up with a better phone, so I am happy.For the phone it is a delight especially if you are an avid smartphone photographer!

The phone I purchased was the Unlocked Verizon Refurbished version so that may be the reason why I kept having problems along with constantly roaming.

The phones came out less than two years ago, and I received mine with a battery that has already been recharged so many times it's deficient. This means they're REALLY used phones that have almost been run into the ground by the first owner. It's a working s10+. It's going to have problems though. It's $100+ to replace the battery it came with, which would nearly offset just BUYING a new one. So, your call.

No voicemail indicator,"Doesn't indicate when you have voicemail. This phone started out in life as a Sprint phone, and apparently there is known problem caused by the Visual Voicemail App that Sprint loads on its phones. I wonder why, when refurbishing and unlocking the phone, they would choose to ignore a known issue. Research tells me that the app cannot be removed without rooting the phone. While most features on the phone are great, I consider voicemail an important function on a phone. Additionally, while I'm sure many people like the curved sides of the screen, the fingerprint reader being in the screen makes it impossible to use a tempered glass screen protector, and the film protectors that will work with the fingerprint reader will not conform to the curved edges of the screen, in spite of the claims they will ""relax.""",2020年2月4日 在美国审核

I'm afraid to use this charger because it might damage the phone outlet with all the forced action.,2022年1月22日 在美国审核
"Nice little 4G phone, if it's working right.","This is a heck of a lot better than the LG V40 that I replaced. It works better, has a brighter screen.. the battery life is a little iffy, but I keep it plugged in most of the time for my job anyway.I LOVE how FAST it is switching screens between different apps!//edit 6-13-2020I had to have this replaced because the GPS never worked properly. It would show me going down a street BACKWARDS and SIDEWAYS. I'm unsure if this was a phone fault or a network fault, as it was a unlocked phone on a Tmobile network - it's possible that it could be a network issue. Regardless, it's been returned for another one which seems to be working fine.",2020年3月17日 在美国审核
Bluetooth not working,"Phone looks like new. Arrived quickly unlocked. The problem with it is the Bluetooth, we bought this phone and since we got it we had many connection problems, in order to use Bluetooth you have to be only 1 foot away from the phone or it will cut off. We couldn't pair it with smart watch or even use an earbuds because it will cut off, I tried everything and also resetting the phone but unfortunately we had to return it . I give it 3 stars because the seller issued our refund quickly but I wish they inspect the Bluetooth before selling it.",2021年10月30日 在美国审核

"NOT UNLOCKED, DON'T BUY","I ordered this phone, this *Unlocked* all-networks-compatible phone to use with Cricket.

Bonus: the wifi doesn't even work, and was certifiably working for other devices. I was so excited to finally have a new phone, and I'm really disappointed.Now I have to wait up to 48hrs to see if they respond to Amazon's inquiry to exchange this for the correct, unlocked phone that was advertised. Even if they fix it properly, I won't change my rating; they literally had one job.*Update: Customer Service assures me that if I use wifi to circumvent the Verizon registration, the phone should eventually connect to my carrier.

It may be clean but it's not as advertised,I feel like they refurbished this phone with an inferior screen replacement. Besides the battery life being garbage! My wife has one of these phones and the battery easily lasts all day even with heavy use with light use that can last almost 2 days. But not mine not this one. My phone is at 25% by 2:00 in the afternoon at best. And on top of that 5:00 or more parts of my screen just can't be interacted with. I did the touchscreen test and there are several spots that I just can't touch and less I hit the power button and then hit it again then I can touch the whole screen but maybe for 5 or 10 seconds.I asked for a new phone and they said okay. They said that they shipped it and that it would be here in 3 to 5 days. 3 to 5 days later I found out that they never even shipped it and when I asked about it they said I could wait about a week and Amazon would cancel my replacement.

"Terrible scuffing on phone bezel, perfect screen, horrible packaging","I suppose I can't complain given the purchase price (it worked out to about $270CAD shipped), but I am really disappointed in the Amazon Renewed S10+. Every other Amazon Renewed product I have purchased has looked brand new, and come in durable packaging.My phone was taped to a cardboard insert and the only packaging for the phone was the box they shipped the packaging in. At first I thought customs had opened and removed the contents, but upon closer inspection, everything was taped down by the refurbisher/reseller.The metal bezel on the phone is heavily scuffed - I have no idea who owned this before, but it looks like someone took sandpaper to the edges. Strangely, the screen and glass back look perfect.

Texts seldom went through or were received.Took it to the Verizon store thinking it was my sim card. But the same problem persisted, and eventually led to the conclusion the phone was not ""Fully Unlocked.""Now I don't know if the seller genuinely didn't know because of the person they bought it from, or they just sent out a random phone, nor do I care, because the phone simply didn't work.

One Very Upset Customer,"Phone arrived completely dead. Once charged, I could not import data from my old phone. I took the phone to my service carrier only to be told the device was not unlocked and is not compatible with my service carrier. I switched the sim card back to my old phone to then discover it no longer worked. At this point (I'm still at the store) I am told that my service had been suspended because my sercice provider does not support 3G devices and, because my 'new phone' was a 3G device, it automatically suspended my service. Twenty minutes later, customer service was able to reactivate my line.I am beyond upset! I currently have a Galaxy S8 and attempted an upgrade to the Galaxy S10+ to find out, after much trouble, that my new phone was actually a downgrade from the phone I already have.This is completely unacceptable.I've read reviews where customers have returned the item for various reasons, and their refunds were extremely so or not at all. Unfortunately, I read these reviews after my order was placed (which, for this very reason I Never do) but I needed a phone quickly. This seemed like a good deal since it was backed by the Amazon guarantee. I guess we'll see....",2021年5月19日 在美国审核
Horrible Customer Service,"I bought this refurbished from RE-CELL.Right at the end of the return period, the phone developed a bright white bar at the bottom of the screen.Following is the text from our conversations:From: RE-Cell HI there, I apologize for the issues with the device. I would double check to see if you purchased any extended warranties that Amazon provides as options, unfortunately due to the time elapsed since the order was placed the warranty period has expired.

"""Verizon"" model still locked to Sprint overdue account!","This phone was sold to me as a refurbished Verizon Galaxy S10+. In fact, when I received it and inserted my SIM card it did not activate and would fail over and over again. I was able to ""activate"" the device itself through Verizon's website but that still did nothing. The phone cannot connect to the Verizon network. It constantly try's to activate through Sprints network, failing every single time. I cannot update the software either. It drops any type of network connectivity every 15-20 minutes and will display ""Sprint"" in the top left corner of the screen; where the network name should displayI tried to bring it into Sprint to explain the situation and see if they could unlock the phone manually and after telling them the device's IMEI number, they explained to me that they cannot unlock my device because it is tied to a Sprint account with a massive outstanding balance.This phone is essentially a giant paperweight now. Not to mention the headphone jack and charging port were caked with sulfation build up from the battery and moisture exposure.Keep in mind I specifically bought a Verizon based model, according to the seller.This has been an incredible inconvenience as I do a lot of my work via mobile. Extremely unhappy at the lack of vetting and detail or just sheer laziness of this seller. 100% would not recommend. I WILL be returning it for a full refund.",2022年6月25日 在美国审核

Received a defective phone,"I really want to like this phone, and 90% of the time I do, but that percentage is directly related to the fact that I'm staying home all of the time thanks to COVID-19. That's because it works just fine on wifi but is utterly useless and infuriating whenever I need to use the mobile network, like when venturing out of the house or trying to send and received text messages or phone calls. I live in an area with a very strong signal, and the phone itself reports high signal bars at all times, but it mobile data is almost unusably slow when it works at all, which I would guess is only about 15% of the time.If the phone worked, I would love it.Unfortunately it is very hard to love a phone that doesn't work as, you know, a phone.

When tried to reach seller (Promo Dealz), they told that they didn't have ceramic version at that time, why would you charge people extra money for it? If you simply reach buyer and explain at least it would look like honest and clear buiseness, instead you try to trick, and get extra dollars.Why I put 2 stars?

Several issues that I could not fit in the reason for needing to return the items.,"At first, it seemed like a good purchase, but right off the bat, I noticed that the phone's power button had somewhat of a delay. I thought nothing and figured it may have just been a temporary deal. Anyway, I charged it and took it to Verizon. They tried to set it up and while it seemed like it 'accepted the SIM'. The weird thing was that it made calls and took texts, but would not accept the SIM cards. There was also an issue with the touch screen. For example, I couldn't tap certain letters or apps because I guess they weren't detecting any touch (I didn't have a protector on either). Also, the package didn't come with a SIM removal tool, which was OK, but I thought that was odd that it didn't. I don't even recall it coming with some protective later like bubble wrap. I get that these are refurbished, but it's practically not 'usable'. I can't utilize all parts of the touch screen and it won't recognize the Verizon sim.

We initially tried consulting T-mobile and they advised that there was nothing wrong with their signals. We have not been able to use the phone in the way intended because 4-months after we realized the phone was not actually unlocked. We attempted to contact the seller but they insist that they are past the 90 day warranty period and cannot make this right, despite selling a product not as advertised (unlocked). It’s unfortunate to deal with sellers like this during a pandemic, especially considering this was my only way to communicate and can’t even make emergency calls now. The wifi calling does not work either. I’m down $500 and have a clock. Consider investigating the seller and reading previous reviews before buying.",2020年12月24日 在美国审核

Microphone to place and receive voice calls does not work - to low to hear,"This is my second Renewed phone and the expectations were not fulfilled as per the Renewed promise.3 major issues I have with this pone are: volume of the device when making and receiving voice phone calls, scratches on the item and the accessories.1. I always wanted to have this phone and particular model because it has nothing to envy when it comes to appearance, performance and features to similar or recent models.Most importantly for me is to be able to make and receive phone voice calls but that is simply impossible because the volume of the device when in microphone mode is so low that you can not hear the other person nor they can hear you back. - I don't have the same hearing issue when in speaker mode or when syncing to my Bluetooth earbuds2. The item came with scratches on the edges like if someone used it before.3. The charger and cable are not recognized by the device and a message pop up to check and use for supported accessories. - They do charge my phone but it takes ages to get a full charge.

BEWARE: Read Reviews!,"I wish I would've read the reviews before I bought from this seller... The phone looks good with no scratches or anything. It LOOKS brand new, I'll give them that.. but when I switched my Sims card over to this phone, I got NO bars.. couldn't call, couldn't text and couldn't use my mobile data. I reached out to Verizons live chat and was told that it was my Sims card.. So the next day I went to the Verizon store.. got a new Sims card and it still wouldn't work. A tech came to see what he can do and come to find out It's NOT the Sims card! It's the PHONE! Was told that whoever ""refurbished"" the phone didn't do a good job and knocked lose a part that aids in my ""activation"" and the connection to the towers.So no matter what I do, this phone will NEVER activate my service; was told to return it and get a refund.

Broken Promises :^(,I'm not going to say do not buy but use caution when purchasing. I took a chance and bought a unlocked Galaxy S10 Plus and when it arrived I set the phone up called the number on the box to set up MetroPCS / T-Mobile service.Completed that and when I left the house to go to work and my phone instantly lost signal. I had to keep rebooting and restarting my phone to send a text or call. This problem continued for three days straight. Even after going to MetroPCS and having them call customer service to troubleshoot why my phone won't stay connected. It works fine on Wi-Fi but once I leave the house it is useless.

"Carrier Unlocked, NOT ""Factory Unlocked"".","The phone looked brand new. After turning it on, I got a message saying that the network could not be verified, that I needed to contact Sprint. That's when I realized that the phone was linked to a carrier before and it was not ""Factory Unlocked"" as specified in the description. After inserting my AT&amp;T SIM Card, the phone connected to the network and started working which was good but I had an icon all the time saying it was attempting to connect to Sprint to validate which was annoying. Then I started trying the phone for 1 week and it seemed to lose connectivity to LTE network and going back to 3G. I also noticed that the phone would heat up during phone calls probably after 5 minutes on a phone call, you would not be able to hold the phone on your hand because it was extremely hot. After some reaserch, I found that that's a common issue for S10s from SPRINT (not sure about the other carriers)Called Amazon to try to fix it and they were helpful and put me through to Samsung. I shipped the phone to Samsung for a motherboard replacement. After getting my phone back, it was locked to the sprint network again so I could not use my phone anymore.Tried reaching out to Sprint but they were as useless as always. Had to send the phone back to amazon because I can't use it anymore.I'd recommend reaching out to the seller before placing an order and asking if they have a phone that belonged to your current carrier so you don't can minimize the amount of problems.",2019年11月12日 在美国审核
Stay away from Samsung if you want quality,"Horrible excuse for a phone. I wish HTC were still making new android phones, they were the best. Everything about this phone is off, the placement of the backspace on the keyboard and the accuracy of the touchscreen for example, it constantly registers me hitting the letter ""L"" rather than the backspace despite my thumb hitting the backspace. Predictive text is absolutely atrocious and won't pick up what word I am typing until I type 80% of the word, then I could select the word to move on quicker, but before that it will suggest words that have no place in the sentence I'm typing.The fingerprint scanner is built into the screen, rather than a separate button, this makes it much less sensitive/accurate. I constantly have to put my finger on there several times or give ups and just enter my code. The curved edges of the screen serve no logical purpose other than them bragging that they're there. They only thing they are good for is helping to ruin your screen protector by allowing it to slide off to one side easier.Battery life is good, that's about the only good thing I have to say about it, but you HAVE to use a Samsung brand charger. I tried using a quick charger from a different phone manufacturer, and it would not charge.",2021年4月19日 在美国审核

"Great phone, but always check the SELLER","This phone is perfect for my needs as a previously limited-app, non-gaming user.Now I'm using more apps, games and functions that my previous S9 couldn't even dream about.The functionality in this S10+ model leapfrogged exponentially.The phone itself was so pristine, one would think it was brand new- which I really didn't care about at this excellent price, but it's totally gift-able :)Huge internal storage capacity (probably more than I need), great camera for a phone (I'm a photographer and prefer actual cameras), and not too large. No S-pen, if that's what you need.Battery life under 35°F isn't optimal, or even very functional until it's warmed up next to body for ~30 min, but at this price, what battery is?Lesson learned: do not leave in cold vehicle for 3+ hours, haha.I purchased this phone I am reviewing 2.5 weeks ago from Re-Cell in CO.Superior service and communication from this seller.Caveat Emptor: I had previously purchased this same model a couple months back but had issues with it being locked to a certain carrier.Seller told me that it was *my* problem, or my new carrier's problem, which sent me on a very non-excellent adventure for a few weeks... they were poor at e-mail communication, and I had to find their phone number on my own.Finally, after a strongly-worded phone call, the shifty company had me send it back to them, but they could not unlock it; told me that sometimes their Unlocked phones ""slip through the cracks.""They should have known this instead of blaming me for being incompetent right off the bat. Very sketchy company out of Edison,NJ, and they've changed company names at least twice. Please beware.",2021年12月21日 在美国审核
I would call it clearly used not renewed but the seller made right,The screen has scratches on it and the edges see scratched and dinged. Also around the camera there was a lot of wear. I did not attempt to activate or turn on the phone. This may not bother some people if you put on a case and all it would not be as noticeable. But the scratches on the screen are the most bothersome to me. For a $340 used phone I guess I expected it to look newer. I can't judge the functionality as I did not use.<br>After contacting seller and finding that functionally the item was great they offered a partial refund as the item looked used instead of new. I did keep the item and received a partial refund. They were very helpful to make things right and very fast with communication.</br>,2021年5月21日 在美国审核
Such a difference from S6,"What a great phone!Had galaxy s6. I keep my phones as long as I can. Finally s6 going bad.

Battery life is fantastic! I will charge my phone before bed, then leave it on and only mute the phone for bed and 8 hrs later when I wake up, I have 97% battery life!Doesn't get any better than that!

Was Not Expecting Very Fast Overnight Delivery,"Review of Samsung Galaxy S10+ Original Release Date 2019.For last 30 yrs I've used Tracfone Prepaid with ATT service except Tracfone sold out to VerizonAT&amp;T is the only tower close to my home; no other carrier gives me even one bar.At the same time AT&amp;T shut down 3G in Feb 2022, my LG G6 stopped working. I keep mobile phones a very long time, so I polled my friends and ended up searching for S10+.I also searched for an ATT MVNO and found RedPocket.The problem was finding the correct S10+ Model # that was compatible with ATT, not all S10+ are VoLTE enabled. Finally Chubbiestech listed Model G973F and I emailed them to confirm that was the correct Model. They replied with Yes it is the correct model # so I placed the order.Amazing, I received the S10+ today, the next day from NY to FLA. Although it's a different model #, I'm so happy because it works. The phone appears to be in new condition even though it's renewed.Thank you Chubbiestech/Cellfeee for the excellent customer service and what I hope will be an excellent product.",2022年6月29日 在美国审核

10/04/21 REVIEW OF S10 PLUS FULLY UNLOCKED PHONE/This listing and store front keeps changing.,"This listing and seller name keeps changing Buyer Beware this use to say the seller was WBB LLC now says something different I have seen the sellers name change within the last few days, twice now! Buyer Beware!Hopefully this review will help all of you.I'll start by saying this phone is unlocked as it says, but ours was a unlocked Verizon phone and will not receive any updates NO security updates and NO new android updates, unless your phone carrier is verizon.It will work with any carrier as it says, you can connect it to your cellphone provider, but it will not get updated to the latest android system or any security updates. You would have to flash firmware on to phone to get it to receive updates.This was very misleading and upsetting when we got the phone.What I suggest is, what ever your carrier is, buy there version of their phone, that way you are guaranteed updates. Example&gt; If you have Metro or T mobile, look for a t mobile unlocked phone.If you have Verizon as your cellphone carrier, get an unlocked Verizon phone.If you have ATT as your cell provider get an unlocked ATT phone. Trust me if your going to spend $250 or more dollars for refurbished you need to get your security updates and android 11 or 12 updates its only fair!Thank heavens Amazon took care of this issue for me. I was quite upset when we found this phone was useless with Metro PCS. I wish sellers were honest and would say no updates on this device.. Instead if you notice they leave out anything in the description about updates.One more bit of info the phone itself was in really good condition! But the whole reason were updating was to get the Samsung support for this model as we have old note 8's. Our note 8 had a more recent security update than this newer phone. We were updating for the security portion of the phonenot just to have a cool newer phone.So good luck remember if you don't have Verizon as your cellphone carrier and you don't no how to flash firmware, look elsewhere, this isn't the phone for you, unless you don't want updates. Also make sure to take screen shots of your purchases. Use your phone take a picture of the screen or take a screen shot with your computer for your backup on item description.",2021年10月4日 在美国审核
Perfect for the price,"Don't trust the negative reviews. Besides some slight scratches on the back that I don't really care about because I'm going to use the phone case anyway, the phone works perfectly fine with my AT&amp;T sim card. With that price, I really can't complain.",2021年8月20日 在美国审核

Junk Phone,"Phone was working phenomenally for about 3 days. After that everything works on it except to make and receive calls. I've factory reset it, I've called ATT, who then transferred me to Samsung. They remotely looked into the phone and still couldn't figure it out. I tried downloading a different calling app even (Google Phone) and still, am unable to make and receive calls. Very inconvenient if I end up having to return it and wait forever again for a replacement. I've never really had any bad experiences when it comes to Amazon. But this could be the first. Hopefully someone can resolve this or I hate to say, I'll have to ask for a refund! I've even bought a new sim card to see if that was the issue. ATT Prepaid told me phone isn't compatible.",2022年3月11日 在美国审核

Doesn't have a single scratch.I will also add that I didn't need to charge it for two whole days! I don't live on my phone but I do spend at least a few hours a day on it. Overall I'm pretty happy with the phone.<br>P.S.Side note, I originally thought I bought the Galaxy note 10+.

Almost as good as new,"I must have spent hours going through reviews on this page, so when I clicked on the ""order"" button, I was already determined to add my two cents to them...I received my phone within a day, and on first inspection, it looked really good. Only when I was cleaning the screen like a maniac to put the protector on did I notice some minuscule scratches on it, never to be seen under the protector anyway. The IMEI test came back clean and having had the phone for close to two weeks now, I haven't had any problems at all.The phone came in a generic box with a charger, a charging cable, and one of the tools to open the sim card slot (by now, I have decided that stud earrings are more convenient for that job). The phone was factory reset with no company affiliation, so no bloatware. Setting it up with Mint Mobile took me about 5 minutes, mostly to copy the settings for wireless data. There was no manual in the box, but this is easily found on the Samsung website, and who wants paper copies anyway.There are five things that I bought (or had laying around anyway) to get the phone to fully functional:* a screen protector* a case (at $500 it's still a lot of money to break)* a MicroSD card. I was debating to reuse the one from my old cell phone, but they are cheap enough and did not want to sort through the photos on that one at that point* earbuds* even though it came with a charging cable, it was pretty short and I ended up getting a longer one. The one it came with got commissioned in the car.The phone itself is a bit larger than what I had envisioned, but no complaints there. The only thing with the size was that it did feel a bit awkward in the beginning when I tried to talk without a headset; having it in a waist pouch and talking using a headset is way more convenient for me. The camera looks great, but I need to play more with it to really learn its tricks. All the apps I was used to are working great. Overall a great experience!",2020年6月13日 在美国审核

Amazing Refurbished S10+,"I use the S10+ as my secondary phone to my iPhone 12 Pro Max and I must say I love it quite a lot. The phone despite being a few years old at this point still runs flawlessly and smooth.The battery life may have been depreciated due to it being refurbished, but for what I paid it still works perfectly. In my opinion the best way to go is to buy a high end refurbished phone from a few generations and replace the battery. You would have a much better experience and time rather than brand new mid range phones of the same price. However, keep in mind that this phone has only a year of Major android version updates left, but security updates would still get pushed regardless.The android versions don't really matter all too much as Android has hit a point of maturity where Android 8 through 11 isn't a whole lot different and they all perform pretty similarly. So you can continue using the phone for quite sometime even after official major android updates have stopped.In terms of performance the Snapdragon 855 paired with 8GB of RAM works wonders. The phone has never lagged and I doubt it will. The cameras still hold up pretty well.I highly recommend getting the phone around $200 to $250 if your budget allows for it",2021年8月12日 在美国审核

My experience has been flawless,"So, I wasn't in the market for a new phone, but when the screen on my S8 completely died, I kind of had to do some research pretty quickly.Since I don't need the newest, best phone out there, I decided that the S10 Plus was the one for me. Better yet, I decided that I've had good experience with Amazon recertified, refurbished, whatever products in the past, so I was willing to gamble on a refurbished phone if it could save me a significant amount of money, and I'm writing this review to let you know that I'm so glad I did!For starters, I purchased the Verizon model, since I have Verizon service. I don't think that actually mattered, though, because I'm fairly certain I have an unlocked model. It does not have any company branding or software installed, and the first time I booted the phone up with my Verizon SIM card, it informed me that it was going to restart itself to format itself for Verizon. And then that was it. No Verizon bloatware or anything, and just a Samsung logo when I start it up. So that was an unexpected plus, especially since buying the Verizon one was $20 cheaper than buying the unlock one!The phone itself looks brand new. There was a single smudge on the back of the phone, which I was able to very easily clean off, and there is literally no other indication that this phone has ever been handled before. The battery life is phenomenal and the condition is flawless.I was admittedly a bit skeptical of buying a recertified phone, but 3 days in, I have what I'm fairly confident is a brand new phone for about 25% of the cost of buying it new.Highly highly recommended! :)",2021年9月4日 在美国审核

Why is the battery so slow to charge?,"Compared to a Huawei mate 9 and a Pixel2 XL, the Lock Screen operation of fingertip or facial recognition both pale in comparison to the super-quick response of the rear-touch fingertip operation of my prior phones. Both ways on this Samsung are inferior. Then there's the battery. Slow to charge and not slow to discharge. By the way, I am not using the charger sent w/ this phone. Using a better, hi-powered one.Screen is nice. Camera is good.",2021年11月23日 在美国审核
Great condition!,"I love my new phone it just came in today, it actually came a day earlier so that's great! The phone overall is in good condition the back has a couple of small barely visible scratches or dings but nothing too major , the phone was fully unlocked so that was amazing since a couple of other people had some issues with theirs and I was worried about that happening to me but thankfully mine came in almost perfect condition :)",2021年4月23日 在美国审核

Absolutely perfect,"Perfect condition straight out of the box. The only thing I found to be a bit annoying was the fact that the charger I was sent was a very poor quality box and I also received no charging cable. I literally got the phone a sim tray tool and a charging box. Thankfully I already had another S10+ that came with the actual Samsung charger and a good quality cable. The other thing was that the firmware on the phone I received was T-mobile firmware. It was advertised as unlocked and not just specifically an unlocked T-mobile phone. Luckily for me this wasn't an issue and I simply flashed the unlocked firmware to the phone immediately inserted my sim card and it worked with the new firmware since it wouldn't recognize my sim card being installed with the firmware that was present when the phone arrived. Other than that though the phone was in immaculate condition for something that was pre-owned and only 1/3 the price of a brand new model. Not a single scratch anywhere on the phone and the battery life is better than expected considering I've been using the other one I have since it was brand new and it doesn't last as long as this one. Amazing quality, amazing service other than the charger not having a cable and me having to flash the firmware myself but I planned to flash it anyway so no big deal there. Thanks so much for beating my expectations!",2021年8月21日 在美国审核

Unbelievable price for this phone | Excellent Condition,"Ok so reading the top reviews on this page I obviously was a little worried. The ones you first see, that have the most helpful markings, all claim to received a defective product. While I don't doubt some or maybe even all of those are true, I believe that most people don't receive such a product, and if they did, they could probably just get a new one that isn't messed up.If you read the reviews that are recent, you'll find a lot of people saying they got exactly what they ordered, and to trust that you'll receive a working Samsung S10+ in good condition. I trusted them and am very glad I did. The phone I received is what I'd say is perfect condition. It looks new, feels new, runs new, is fully unlocked, is super fast, and has no issues. The screen doesn't have the slightest mark, and neither does any other part of the phone. The battery life seems like it may be a tiny bit less than brand new, but maybe not since it has dropped 23% over 7 hours with on and off use. I'm not sure. I haven't written a review before, but with the quality of this product, I felt it most definitely deserved so.Not only am I pleased with the fact that I received something better than I even expected, the phone itself is amazing. Way better than the iPhone XR or iPhone 11 I had. The last samsung I had was an S7, and I am very excited to have a galaxy again. For the price, I don't think there is a better option out there for a very fast and sharp looking smartphone.If you are looking at this phone but worried because of all the negative reviews marked the most helpful, know that those are probably the few unlucky cases if they are even true, and reality is, as inconvenient it would be to a defective product like that, I doubt that they were ""stuck"" with it and couldn't return it.I would most definitely buy this product again, and at the price may even buy an extra in case I lose mine or break it.",2021年7月23日 在美国审核
"Phone is fine, seller great!","I HATE getting a new phone! I'm super fussy about how I want mine set up so I spend day after frustrating day trying to get it right. And moving to a different brand adds to the frustration.I liked my original Google Pixel XL a lot. It was really comfortable and just worked the way I wanted it to. But it started dying finally... Got this Samsung Galaxy S10+ renewed from Gizmotrader. They are the best!The phone is like new. So far it works well (having to get used to it). Seems like everything works perfectly.When I bought it, my charge didn't go through. (oops!) I contacted Gizmotrader and they were super understanding and patient about waiting the day or two for me to fix it. Once paid, they sent it immediately, and quickly. It arrived complete except without the SIM tool. They apologized and sent one out right away.If I were going to buy another phone (God forbid), I would search out Gizmotrader for my purchase.",2021年8月10日 在美国审核

Virtually indistinguishable from being new,"Purchased a couple weeks back now, and so far I am very satisfied. No scratches on the screen or camera lenses, and almost unnoticeable marks/scratches on the bottom and near the sim card tray. However with a case on, like the headline says, it is indistinguishable from being new.The only tell of real use is the battery health. The battery's capacity was ~3150mAh out of the 4000mAh that it starts with. It still lasts plenty long, a couple days, on a full charge. Though, I only like to 'full charge' to 80% in order to maximize my battery's lifespan.I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but I specifically made sure to go through Chubbiestech since another phone I got from them was in even arguably even better condition. The battery on that one was ~4350mAh out of 4500mAh.",2021年8月10日 在美国审核

Am Amazing Product,"I've had this phone for almost two weeks, so this is only my initial impression. I was very pleased to find how good of a condition this phone was in. I'm not kidding..... it is like new. Not a mark on it, not even the smallest scratch that I could find!It functions like a new phone in every way. Big test was how the battery would hold out as I used it all day at work. Listening to podcasts all day, texting, phone calls, some internet usage. It passed the test no problem. Still about 40 % left by the time I got home.I love this phone and what a deal compared to the price when new!!What's really good is that I just received the Samsung Android 12 One UI 4.1 update (this is the latest one). And with it,the latest security patch. From what I've read, this model should continue to get regular, quarterly security updates, so I feel good about using this phone for a while.And kudos to Amazon Refurbushed, for ensuring I received another great product from a good seller.All around, an excellent experience.I give it 10 out of 5 stars!",2022年5月25日 在加拿大审核
El producto está acorde con la descripción,"El producto es justamente como se describe. Hasta ahora solo llevo tres días de uso, y el teléfono responde bien. La batería dura un poco menos de lo esperado, pero es un tema de consumo de energía de los teléfonos de Samsung en general (probablemente agravado un poco considerando que el producto es renewed). En general, estoy satisfecho con el producto y la compra, considerando el gran ahorro que representa versus un producto totalmente nuevo. Si bien el teléfono se ve con un poco de uso, la realidad es que no he encontrado defectos físicos o imperfecciones relevantes, y todo parece estar en orden. La entrega de hizo en tiempo. Actualización: detecté un par de rayones en el equipo, nada serio y supongo que se deben al uso; mantengo la calificación ya que el producto es tal como se describe.",2020年1月13日 在墨西哥审核

AMAZON NO SE HACER RESPONSABLE,"Jamás compren un Celular Renewed, es tirar su dinero, yo compré un Galaxy S10+ en $13,700 pesos Mexicanos y aunque la descripción dice que te dan 90 días de garantía, es una MENTIRA, la pila del celular no dura, lo tengo que estar cargando varias veces al día y cuando me comuniqué para solicitar la devolución, me dijeron que no podían hacer nada, que me comunicara a Samsung para solicitar la garantía, lo cual es una estupidez, la garantía de fábrica ya expiró, es un producto USADO, si no van a dar los 90 días, mejor no pongan nada, el vendedor es GECV Electronics y no hay forma de contactarlo desde la plataforma de Amazon. Qué decepción de Amazon!",2020年10月29日 在墨西哥审核
The phone was NOT totally wiped from previous Vendor (Sprint),"When I tried initially to insert a new SIM, it showed some issues, had to work with my USA Mobile supplier for hours to get it to work, that's the bad part, eventually -after 5 hours of technical support, we got it to work.<br>The good part: the phone is basically brand new, no issues cosmetically or technologically that I can see or experience, it's perfect once the new Sim card is activated and the new Mobile network is updated.It also updated to Android 11, with no issues, however, it shuts down intermittently after using it for 2 weeks .The Amazon (Reliable Cellular)vendor did not reply, even after 48 hours, so don't expect to get support, if the phone was defective I would have made a major issue with Amazon, thankfully it is ok. Beware that the previous mobile software and mobile locks are erased BEFORE you insert your new Sim card.When I added 128 SD extra memory to be able to download my music, the card appears to not be able to be written to, intermittent problem, after speaking to the vendor, they promised to look into this when the phone is returned. So far (now 1 week later) the refund HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED. This vendor has a Canadian drop off depot in Calgary, I am in Toronto, had to pay $20 for special registered delivery to Calgary, the Vendor DID NOT specify this little detail during the return instructions, totally unacceptable return procedure, avoid this Vendor for ""renewed"" cell phones shipped to Canada from the USA.</br>",2021年7月9日 在加拿大审核
Vale la pena?,"-------Update 6 de mayo 2020---------La cámara se puso en un estado peor que antes. Ahora se escucha un clic cuando alguna app quiere acceder a la cámara (incluso la app de la cámara). La cámara se tarda en responder a pesar de que reinicie el celular y borre la caché de la camara. Era un gran teléfono ): ya incié el proceso de devolución.--------------------------------------------En cuanto llegó el celular me percaté de que el cargador no era original (he visto vídeos de copias chinas) y efectivamente el cargador solo sirvió una vez y el cable era de la peor calidad posible. A pesar de eso, decidí darle una oportunidad a este teléfono. Lo usé un par de minutos y lo actualicé por completo pero me dí cuenta que la parte trasera no estaba bien. Parece que abrieron el teléfono y ya no les dio tiempo de cerrarlo correctamente. Por esta parte, dudo que tenga la protección IP68 y no me atrevo a sumergirlo.Aun así, todo funcionó perfecto... hasta que abrí la cámara ):Al usarla por primera vez, parecía ir bien pero cuando abrí el modo x2 se empezó a congelar excesivamente al punto de que tenia que cerrar la cámara y volverla a iniciar pero después de unas cuantas fotos se pasmaba de nuevo ): Igualmente noté problemas con otras apps que usan la cámara, por ejemplo, whatsapp o un escaner, que decían tener error al abrir la cámara o abrían la cámara totalmente desenfocada sin oportunidad de enfocar. Tenía que cerrar la app y volverla a abrir para que funcionara de forma correcta. Al momento de esta review parece que encontré la solución a este problema. Haré update si funciona al 100%.Estos fueron los pequeos grandes detalles que encontré en este teléfono. Todo lo demás funciona de maravilla: WiFi, NFC, Carga inalambrica, Bluetooth, micrófonos, bocinas, sensor de huellas, batería, flash, lector de ritmo cardiaco, etc...Me quedaré este teléfono un par de días más a ver cómo se desenvuelve.",2020年4月29日 在墨西哥审核
No esperes un teléfono sin detalles,"Creo que recibí algo recíproco a lo que pagué.El teléfono llegó en tiempo, desbloqueado y con un cargador genérico.Lo malo:Tiene detalles la pantalla, se aprecian rayones cuando esta apagada la pantalla y en luz de día (con la pantalla encendida no se aprecian)El cristal de la cámara trasera también tiene detalles aunque no afectan las fotos.En la parte metálica inferior también tiene un detalle.Lo bueno:Vino desbloqueadoBateria razonableEs un buen teléfonoNo pagué un montón como si lo hubiera comprado nuevoPosible detalle mayor:Sigo evaluando pero me he percatado que la velocidad de WiFi se cae bastante, solo lo hace este teléfono. La verdad no se si devolverlo por esto, me ha gustado mucho el teléfono pero si tiene este detalle",2021年6月26日 在墨西哥审核
"Phone faulty, just out of revised warrantee","Four months after receipt, the screen area around the fingerprint reader became intermittently unresponsive.It sometimes starts working properly after a cache clear, but soon goes back to its evil ways.The phone is essentially unusable, and the seller says it's out of their 90-day warrantee, and I'm outta luck.Looking into the config, it seems this was originally an Australian phone, which Samsung Canada confirmed when I called for help: they said they don't support my model variant. even just tech support.I assume Amazon stands by their seller but that's s a little odd.Be careful, because the hardware may not be supported by the manufacturer locally.And their 90 day clearly isn't enough: if the thing is renewed to ""as-new,"" why not a full year?",2020年6月19日 在加拿大审核
there were a distorted image picture camera,when I took a picture in bright light on the rear front camera i see a distorted light yellowish image on the picture. I'm not sure if the camera is defected or the software. Not pleased and always double check when you buy phones.,2019年12月9日 在加拿大审核

"Cumplen con lo que prometen, pero hasta ahí!","Para empezar debo aclarar que compre los equipos con Chubbiestech. Y la verdad es que las dos veces me llegaron equipos con una estética de 9, si tenían un pequeo raspón en el cromo de la cámara, o un rayoncito en los laterales pero nada más.Te llega el celular en una caja genérica, con un cargador y cable de muy baja calidad, por lo que toca invertir en un buen cargador y cable, pero la verdad no hay quejas por ese lado.Los dos equipos llegaron desbloqueados y en México agarraron la red 4.5g.Ahora, el tema más controvertido es la batería, dicen que los celulares mínimo llegan con el 80% de vida de la batería y en ocasiones así es, un equipo de los dos que compre tenia justo el 82% de vida. Pero en otras ocasiones te llega un celular con un 95% de batería lo cual es excepcional para ser un celular ya con aos de desgaste.En resúmen, cumplen con lo que prometen, y es un buen ahorro aún en 2022!",2022年5月28日 在墨西哥审核
Updated review:,"Waited more than 10 days for the phone to just ship, then when it did arrive it was AT&amp;T locked, which means that I cannot update it and I'm stuck with having 10+ AT&amp;T bloatware apps that cannot be uninstalled. (one of them is half a GB!) Have to return it now.However, the condition of the phone was very good. I could only notice a few faint marks on the back, and the screen was basically new.It came in a generic box but inside it had the original Samsung charging brick, cable, USB-C to USB adapter, sim eject tool, and AKJ Earbuds. All of them were packaged in small plastic bags and haven't been opened. I don't know if I just got lucky or if everyone received them... also for those wondering mine did not have the plastic screen protector that is usually included with Samsung phones.Update:Just received the replacement phone (very early!). This time it is actually factory unlocked and I could update it. Condition of the phone was like new apart from some dust or something around the Earpiece. Unfortunately this time it arrived without any accessories except the Samsung charger but that doesn't matter too much. (Still no screen protector either in case your wondering). I'll update my review to 3 stars because of the inconveniences.Overall satisfied but it took some time.Update (2): Seems like the charging brick and/or cable they sent is defective and heavily used, need to buy a new one. Not too big of a deal but still inconvenient. Lowered to 2 stars.",2021年8月27日 在加拿大审核
as advertised,not sure if i was just lucky or not but this phone is great....no marks or scratches...battery health is awesome...came unlocked and worked with my Canadian provider (Freedom)...data transfer and set up does take some time as is normal...phone required sw updates...would be 5 stars except it doesnt come with the mini usb adapter as a new one does to connect between 2 phones for the data xfer...,2022年6月22日 在加拿大审核
Satisfecho,"Aún que llevo poco tiempo usando el teléfono he notado un buen rendimiento, como se específico en la descripción el equipo llego en caja genérica al igual que el cable y cubo pero el teléfono llego con estética 9/10, realmente los detalles que tiene son mínimos, hasta el momento estoy satisfecho con la compra",2022年1月1日 在墨西哥审核

Really good phone,"Feels like new, I couldn't notice any difference between this phone and a new one. Just be aware that they don't send any accessories but a very cheap charger (not a fast charger, so I had to buy a new one), and the box is not original. I think it could have been packed a bit better also. But overall (besides the missing accessories), I'm satisfied with the phone :) .",2020年1月14日 在加拿大审核

Activation Error 407,"So yes Sprint network kept appearing on my phone. I’m in Canada. I have spent literally hours to get this phone to work. It says it will work on major Canadian carriers. I keep getting an activation error 407 message, something to do with Omadm app. I checked out how to fix this, you have to keep removing the sim tray which is ridiculous.

Pantalla AMOLED no funciona,"Todo bien, fisicamente sin ningun rasguo, funciona con telcel, procesador Qualcomm Snapdragon muy rapido, se siente la diferencia, me llego en 4 dias,( 2 antes de lo programado).Sin embargo tengo un detalle con la pantalla, los colores se ven palidos, poco contraste y poca resolucion decolores. La diferencia es bastante obvia si ya has tenido pantalla AMOLED como por ejemplo mi antiguo S8+ el cual todavia se ve mucho mejor que este s10+. No encontre la manera de activar la pantalla AMOLED, no me da la opcion, tal vez debido a que la pantalla no es AMOLED. En las fotos se muestran la pantalla de configuracion del S10+ que acabo de comprar a la derecha y la otra a la izquierda, de mi antiguo S8+ donde se observa la opcion AMOLED.Creo que tendre que regresarlo, a menos que encuentre como activar AMOLED.",2022年6月22日 在墨西哥审核

BUYER BEWARE!!!  Phone was neither Canadian nor unlocked,"When I received the phone I was very happy with the condition. It was immaculate and everything seems to be as stated. I bought this phone because it was supposed to be a Canadian phone that was unlocked. The big problem with that was, that it was neither. Upon booting it up I saw a Verizon screen and when I attempted to put in my SIM card it told me it was not a Verizon SIM. After speaking with an Amazon representative I decided to return the merchandise. The problem was when I attempted to return the merchandise it was not an option that was available. So at this point I am stuck with a phone but I cannot use and cannot return. Luckily Amazon being a very fair company provided me with a full refund which I appreciated very much.<br>I am writing this review was a warning for anyone buying from this company. Be aware that you may not be getting what you asked for and if you don't you will not be able to return it.
